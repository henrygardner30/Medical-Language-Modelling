    "Question": "i am a type 2 diabetic and my kidneys are in the beginning stages of breakdown. how can i slow that process?",
    "Answer": "strategies for fighting diabetes are pretty much the same as the strategies for fighting diabetic kidney disease. doctors and patients try to keep the blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels in excellent control because high glucose and/or blood pressure can accelerate the damage. an eating and exercise strategy designed to reverse the diabetes as much as possible is a top priority for slowing the kidney damage. this would involve losing as much excess body fat as possible and keeping your muscles heart and lungs in shape via cardio and resistance exercise. there are many good eating strategies. avoiding excess starch sugar and animal fat are the top priorities in my view. avoiding excess salt and protein may also slow the kidney disease. . a good way to follow the kidney disease progression or slowing is via the urine protein levels as well as the \"glomerular filtration rate\" (gfr) test."

    "Question": "what is a homa calculation?",
    "Answer": "homa calculation is a good adjunct to a1c and glucose testing in folks with type 2 diabete prediabetes or risk of diabetes due to family history or obesity. i believe more endocrinologists and other clinicians caring for such patients will use the homa calculator more routinely in the future. not to diagnose diabetes but rather to gain insight into the relative contributions of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in folks with elevated a1c. i suspect homa can be used to spot people at risk for diabetes sooner than current screening tests (fasting glucose or a1c) however the appropriateness of this test for screening and perhaps for diagosis would need to be studied scientifically. in the meantime i believe it is a useful clinical tool under the right circumstances. . pancreatic beta cell function can be roughly estimated by measuring fasting insulin and glucose simultaneously (ask your doctor for these blood tests) then using. [a] homa calculator to assess the estimated beta cell activity and insulin resistance. . homa stands for \"homeostasis model assessment\". the general concept is that the higher your insulin resistance (due to excess body fat genetics or other causes) the harder your beta cells need to work to produce enough insulin to keep the glucose levels normal. someone with lots of insulin resistance say twice as much (200%) of a normal healthy person will have to have lots of beta cell activity (150% or 200%) just to compensate. over many years of excess beta cell activity (over 100% activity) then in some individuals the beta cell activity will start to peter out as reflected by lower insulin levels (or inappropriately non-elevated insulin levels in the face of mildly elevated glucose) and the calculator will indicate there is only around 50% beta cell activity. the a1c doesn't start to go up into the prediabetic range (a1c 6. 0-6. 4) until the beta cell activity is around 60%-50%. beta cell activity in the 40% or less range is what we see in type 2 diabetes. if we measured insulin and glucose and used the homa calculator in seemingly normal patients with moderate-to-high risk of eventual type 2 diabetes--such as patients with parents or siblings with type 2 or in patients wiith obesity then we could probably clarify the diabetes risk even sooner. we would not have to wait until beta cell function is 60%. we could spot it when it is at 80% etc. and monitor it. i think this is a concept scientists should explore further as a potential component of a national diabetes prevention/reversal strategy. ."

    "Answer": "at this point it would really be impossible to have a 100% assurance as to the father of your unborn child. sperm can remain viable in the female genital tract for more than a week so depending on your date of ovulation (usually mid-cycle but not always exactly on that date) it could be either one. you may have to wait until the birth of your baby and then get a paternity test on the two possible candidates."

    "Question": "is it normal for my boyfriends balls to be small? . okay my boyfriend is still a virgin he's almost 16 6ft4 and his penis is not on the small side. but i'm still not understanding why his balls are small. is it because he's a virgin? i don't want to ask him and hurt his feelings or crush his \"manhood. \" help!",
    "Answer": "all men are not created equal. the size of a man's testicles. or feet. or ears. or any other body part is genetically-determined. i have no idea if what he has is normal or not since i cannot examine him but if his doctor doesn't feel there is a problem then that is just the way he is. testicles do not increase in size after a person has sex so they are what they are. let it go. don't make him feel self-conscious. it would trouble him why you were such a testicle-size expert. sure the size of his testicles does not mean anything. if anything i wish my testicles were somewhat smaller. mine are pretty big and i don't like it they get in the way often when i lay on my side. but i do like feeling how big they are. anyways don't worry about the size of his testicles. if his penis size pleases you the testicle size shouldn't even matter. it doesn't have anything to do with being a virgin or not it's just how he was made. one question were his testicles shriveled up due to him being cold? maybe his testicles are normal sized but they shrunk because of cold air/water. again no need to worry about the size and i wouldn't ask him about it if someone questioned me for having a small penis/testicles i would be hurt. what makes you think they're small? have you seen bigger ones before? as you've been able to get so close to them i suspect he isn't going to be allowed to remain a virgin much longer so please be careful. you'll need protection from disease and pregnancy. after you look after the matter of protection i think you'll find the size of the testicles has nothing to do with the performance of the penis. sometimes they're not even equal in size for example the left being small and the right being large but it doesn't matter. i don't think it is something you need to ask him about. just think about how you'd feel if he asked why your breasts weren't as large (or as small) as whatever he thought was \"normal\". hi once you have been around a bit more you will understand not all men are equal. we all come in different sizes our wedding tackle is a mix and match affair some guys have a small penis and large testicles and vice versa and some every thing is small or large. the only thing you need to worry about is when it comes to sex/love making one more thing to think about is not all women like a man with a big penis for some of you it can be painful and painful is not enjoyable. when it comes to sex/love making don't worry to much about size its performance you need you need a man who can last for you to be satisfied. do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Question": "what can i expect during week 34 of my pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "baby : your baby measures about 19. 8 inches from head to toe and weighs about 5 pounds. baby is probably settling into the head-down position although it might not be final. organs are now almost fully mature except for lungs and the skin is pink instead of red. fingernails reach the ends of fingers but toenails are not yet fully grown. baby might have lots of hair. movements are less frequent because of the tight fit. mom-to-be : your uterus hardens and contracts as practice for labor known as braxton hicks contractions but you may not feel them yet. your pelvis has expanded and may ache especially at the back. the uterus is pushed hard against your lower ribs and your rib cage may be sore and your navel is probably pushing out as a result of your abdomen being stretched. tip of the week : start thinking about whether you want to breastfeed which helps increase your child's immunities. you may want to consult a lactation expert or the la leche league an organization that encourages and promotes breastfeeding or simply talk with friends or relatives who can share their experiences."

    "Question": "can you smoke while using nicoderm patches",
    "Answer": "not a good idea. too much nicotine. when a person smokes he/she inhales nicotine. when you stop smoking your nicotine levels drop quickly. nicoderma or nicotine gum feels the gap by providing the nicotine to the body. if you will use both cigarette and nicoderma it will push a increased level of nicotine in the body which is not good at all. for more information o this you can visit topdrugmart. cigarette and nicoderma both contains nicotine so taking bath at a same time will hurt your health as this will increase nicotine level in the body. for more information you can visit topdrugmart."

    "Question": "is it better to drink something cold or hot i. e. water or tea for weight loss? . i have started trying to drink water instead of sodas for weight loss. having had a bad experience where i drank too much water and got sick i have been starting off with 20 oz of ice cold water a day. a friend of mine said the water should be either room temp or hot in order to lose weight. she said cold water will congeal the fat in my system. is this correct?",
    "Answer": "i don’t think the idea that cold water causes fat in your stomach to congeal making weight loss more difficult holds much merit. all fat whether solid or liquid will get broken down metabolized and digested in your body. if anything ice cold water may actually slightly boost your metabolism to help promote weight loss. although it’s a very small amount your body has to expend calories to bring the ice water up to your body’s natural temperature. in your situation drinking water is helping to keep you from drinking soda which doesn’t have much nutritional value and has excessive amounts of sugar. so you should continue to substitute water in place of sugar-laden beverages like soda in order to promote weight loss. you don’t have to completely get rid of soda if you enjoy it but continue to be mindful of moderation and portion control when you do have it."

    "Answer": "i can’t count how many people around me are coming down with a winter cold/flu. i’m in the process of trying to boost up my immune system and fight the good fight and not end up in bed for a few days. the odds are stacked against me. half of the people at my restaurant have been sick as well as the kids at my daughters’ school and i’ve been on six flights in the past 10 days. i can feel the colds lurking around and waiting to pounce. i usually remember to amp up my vitamin c intake when this season starts to come around. (i add 1 000 mg of the powdered form to water with fresh lemon juice two to three times a day). there are things we can do to try to up our chances for staying healthy: getting enough rest keeping our hands washed and drinking plenty of water are the top three. the good news is there are many foods in our kitchens that are beneficial to keeping our immune system strong and in fighting condition. at the top of the list are: 100 percent orange juice (preferably fresh squeezed). avocado. tomatoes. bell peppers. broccoli. garlic. grapefruit. lean meat. yogurt or kefir (not one too high in sugar). the great thing is you can use these foods throughout your day: a glass of fresh orange juice and yogurt is a healthy start to the day. you can add avocado tomatoes and turkey to a salad or a sandwich on whole-grain bread for lunch. for dinner i love to make a broth with lots of slivered garlic when i feel a cold coming on. i’ll use already made organic chicken broth and sliver about 3-4 cloves or garlic and add a lot of lime or lemon to the broth. if i have fresh ginger i will grate this into the heating broth as well. finely chopped up broccoli is perfect tossed in at the end. add a couple of cups of baby spinach (to 4 cups of broth) as well or thinly cut up kale or chard. this will give an additional boost of vitamin c. another use for grapefruit is in a salad. you can toss avocado and grapefruit segments with mixed lettuces. add extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice salt and cracked pepper for a healthy delicious salad that will be on your side in a fight against a cold."

    "Question": "what is atopic dermatitis?",
    "Answer": "atopic dermatitis is a very common often chronic (long-lasting) skin disease. it is also called eczema dermatitis or atopy. most commonly it may be thought of as a type of skin allergy or sensitivity. the atopic dermatitis triad includes asthma allergies (hay fever) and eczema. there is a known hereditary component of the disease and it is seen more in some families. the hallmarks of the disease include skin rashes and itching. the word \"dermatitis\" means inflammation of the skin. \"atopic\" refers to diseases that are hereditary tend to run in families and often occur together. in atopic dermatitis the skin becomes extremely itchy and inflamed causing redness swelling cracking weeping crusting and scaling. dry skin is a very common complaint and an underlying cause of some of the typical rash symptoms. although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age most often it affects infants and young children. in some instances it may persist into adulthood or actually first show up later in life. many patients tend to have a longterm course with various ups and downs. in most cases there are periods of time when the disease is worse called exacerbations or flares which are followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely called remissions. many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission of the disease when they get older although their skin may remain somewhat dry and easily irritated. multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis including dry skin seasonal allergies exposure to harsh soaps and detergents new skin products or creams and cold weather. environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time in the lives of people who have inherited the atopic disease trait."

    "Answer": "it's difficult to tell why high fiber foods are causing you gastrointestinal (gi) problems. typically for reflux a high fiber diet is recommended because it increases transit time. on the other hand these foods are typically problematic. but everyone has different trigger foods and fiber can exacerbate some gi problems. here are some things to try: avoid eating a lot of fiber in one sitting. instead spread out smaller amounts of high fiber foods throughout the day. make sure you get adequate water with your meals. cooked vegetables and fruits without tough skins are usually easier to digest. keep a food journal of what you eat and your symptoms and consider visiting a registered dietitian for help identifying problem foods."

    "Answer": "how athlete's foot (tinea pedis) develops and how well it responds to treatment depends on the type of athlete's foot you have. toe web infection (interdigital) toe web infections (interdigital) often begin with skin that seems moist and pale white. you may notice itching burning and a slight odor. as the infection gets worse the skin between the toes becomes scaly peels and cracks. if the fungal infection becomes severe a bacterial infection also may develop. this can cause further skin breakdown. the bacterial infection may also infect the lower leg ( cellulitis of the lower leg). toe web infections often result in a sudden vesicular (blister) infection. toe web infections respond well to treatment. moccasin-type infection moccasin-type infections may begin with minor irritation dryness itching burning or scaly skin and progress to thickened cracked skin on the sole or heel. in severe cases the toenails become infected and can thicken crumble and even fall out. if you do not take preventive measures this infection often returns. you may also develop an infection on the palm of the hand (symptoms commonly affect one hand and both feet). moccasin-type infections may be long-lasting (chronic) and are very difficult to treat. vesicular infection vesicular infections ( blisters ) usually begin with a sudden outbreak of blisters that become red and inflamed. blisters occasionally erupt again after the initial infection. a bacterial infection may also be present. a vesicular infection often develops from a long-lasting toe web infection. blisters may also appear on palms the side of the fingers and other areas (dermatophytid or id reaction). vesicular infections usually respond well to treatment. complications if untreated skin blisters and cracks caused by athlete's foot can lead to severe bacterial infections. in some types of athlete's foot the toenails may be infected. for more information see the topic fungal nail infections. all types of athlete's foot can be treated but symptoms often return after treatment. athlete's foot is most likely to return if: you don't take preventive measures and are again exposed to fungi that cause athlete's foot. you don't use antifungal medicine for the prescribed length of time and the fungi are not completely killed. the fungi are not completely killed even after the full course of medicine. severe infections that appear suddenly and keep returning can lead to long-lasting infection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "just get him to drink more. not just milk (which can be constipating in some children). the lack of bowel movement is not concerning as long as he is acting fine. when you are not drinking sufficient fluids the body actually pulls water from the colon to use (not the bladder). there may not be any \"extra\" fluid for him to urinate so this is why you need to really encourage good hydration today. signs of dehydration in children would include dry eyes (no tears) and a dry mouth (no saliva). if he has wet eyes and mouth you can just hang in there a bit longer and see if increased fluids today will help. popsicles commercially-available electrolyte solutions jello ice chips etc. all can entice a toddler to hydrate."

    "Answer": "many things can cause vaginal irritation and burning like yeast soaps and detergents and it is normal for people to attribute the cause to the last thing they may have done. while it is possible that you are having a sensitivity reaction to one or more of the chemicals in the tissue this should be quickly relieved by simply washing it off and rinsing well with water. it is not likely that a tissue would cause you to have a skin or mucosal cyst. the only way to get a definitive diagnosis of course is to have a medical provider examine you. this is what i would suggest if your symptoms continue."

    "Answer": "toxoplasmosis is a common infection found in birds animals and people. for most people it doesn't cause serious health problems. but for a pregnant woman’s growing baby it can cause brain damage and vision loss. still the chance of a pregnant woman getting the infection and passing it on to her baby is low. if you're pregnant or planning to have a baby and are worried that you may have toxoplasmosis ask your doctor about getting tested. after you have had the infection you can't get it again or pass it on to your baby. you're immune. your body has learned how to fight it off. you don't have to worry about passing the infection to your baby. but if you aren't immune you'll want to take special care while you're pregnant. avoid touching or eating anything that may be infected such as infected meat and infected cat feces. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "hi this is from the uk's nhs as you said that you have a hernia. an inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel such as the intestine pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. the hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin or as an enlarged scrotum. the lump is often painless but it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation). so hence the pain and this would lead on to infertility. if its that bad and you want a child then its time to get it worked on. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "well the answer to that question is up to you and your therapist or the prescribing medical professional. as i'm sure you're aware xet-10 (generic name: paroxetine ) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) which is prescribed for anxiety obsessive-compulsive disorder depression ptsd and other mental health conditions. some people need to take these medications for a long period of time while others can safely go off them eventually. the fact you say \"i am fine\" is a good sign. that means the paroxetine is working. you may not \"be fine\" if you go off the medication. and you should never stop taking this type of medication abruptly. these types of medications should be tapered off under the supervision of a medical professional. stopping these medications abruptly can cause severe symptoms including thoughts of harming yourself. if you're concerned or confused about why you're taking this medication -- or whether or not you need to continue taking it -- then you should schedule an appointment with the person who prescribed it. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "how can i get rid of tummy cellulite?",
    "Answer": "what i would do is: remove your excess fat gradually as rapid weight reduction makes your skin looser -- aiming for no more than 1/2-2 pounds of fat per week. weight lift 2-3 times a week incorporating core exercises along with the usual total body weight program. eat enough protein every day to build and maintain optimal muscle (60-80 grams per day). core work does not affect loose skin but you need to do it to strengthen and shape your ab and pilates is terrific. get your body fat % done and aim for 25% or so and then whatever the weight is commensurate with that go with that. once you have achieved the body composition that is optimal for you look at your abdomen. there is no magic pill or potion or exercise that will eliminate your loose skin. you will look and feel terrific at your goal body composition. you'll then have to ask yourself how much your ab really bothers you. . you might also meet with a plastic surgeon to discuss options. many people who have lots of skin sag do undergo a simple tummy tuck. some of my patients who've dropped 50 or more pounds live with their loose skin while others head for surgical correction. this is a personal decision. you can get rid of cellulite with the number of treatments like swimming walking weight training there are also number of spa treatments and laser treatments and endermologie treatment which can healp you to get rid of cellulite. but the question is that these method help you to get rid of cellulite permanently? because many people complain that after taking those costly treatments they are not able to vanish those cellulite completely. here i know and used a cream few months ago which helps me to recover the cellulite permanantly till now and is very reasonable which is within your budget you can use revitashape cream it is really very effective. source: <link> insulin proliferation in our bodies could lead to excessive fat. therefore discuss with your doctor for a 2-hour sugar challenge and measure the insulin spike. if allowed to continue excessive insulin could give rise to diabetes."

    "Question": "i am 14 and just lost 60 pounds. i have a lot of excess skin on my belly. what can i do to get rid of it?",
    "Answer": "your concern about the loose skin is a common one in an individual who has lost a great deal of weight sometimes quickly. while your skin is adaptable it can take quite a bit of time for it to return to its more firm suppleness after experiencing weight loss as you have done. try not to expect it to get better overnight or even in a couple of weeks. you're young enough that it is not necessarily recommended to seek surgery to take care of the excess skin. if it continues to be a problem after several months you could discuss it. but i'm sure you will find that by that time it will be much better. in the meantime continue to eat nutritiously exercise wisely and enjoy life. you should try to not eat too much junk food because that can lead to diabetes and in extreme cases it can lead to obesity and death. so try not to eat too much sugary foods. if you want a snack try to have a piece of fruit instead of a bag of chips or drink water instead of high sugar juices and soda."

    "Answer": "your not alone in this world. your story is kind of similar to mine. i had been bullied verbally. even after changing schools people would treat me the same. they would whisper or talk behind my back look at me and make fun of me. the pain is unbearable huh? not only the bullying at school started my anxiety disorder but it also came from my home nothing physical just verbally and emotionally i was hurt. as soon as i started college i began to take therapy if figured i had nothing else to lose you know? what else could happen to me? i've been feeling pain throughout my life i'm use to it. i couldn't trust anyone throughout my childhood. however i felt tired suffocated and sad being alone and afraid so i decided to change. no matter how much pain i felt i didn't want to feel depress any more and if i wanted to become free from my past and i guess my family i needed to built my strength. thanks to therapy i was able to deal with my anxiety and meet someone else could see understand me hear me out without judging my every word. i was someone who was damaged but i was fixed little by little. although to be honest it still kinda of hurts thinking about those days."

    "Question": "my dad is an alcholic and ill. we think he has liver kidney and heart problems. how long does he have to live? . he refuses to see a doctor but is very fatigued and is in bed all day. he also has developed a strange bruise on his chest near his heart. his appetite had diminished and he has lost a lot of weight. he also has yellowing/puffy eyes. he continues to drink daily (vodka). he has high blood pressure (and has most of his life). i also think he is losing his mental capabilities. i just would like to know how much time i have left with him.",
    "Answer": "i'm very sorry to hear this. alcoholism is a terrible disease. from the symptoms you describe it does sound like your father's physical condition is an advanced state of deterioration. yellowing of the white parts of the eye is a sign of liver failure. fatigue and weight loss often occur toward the end of life. i'm sorry your father won't seek medical attention. and i'm very sorry you have to witness his deterioration. obviously no one can predict how much time any individual has left on earth but in general this situation doesn't sound good. as a person enters the actual dying process they lose the ability to walk lose control of bladder and bowel function and eventually enter a coma-like state before they pass to the other side. are you able to get hospice care for your father? virtually all types of insurance cover this care which could be a great comfort to you and your dad. if your father is reluctant you can perhaps reassure him you only want him to be comfortable during this time of life. hospice care focuses on comfort and pain relief. at the very least perhaps you can get a hospice provider to make a home visit to evaluate the situation. i wish you peace."

    "Answer": "anybody can develop a cold weather-related injury. the young and the elderly are more prone to these types of injuries due to vascular compromise or inability to effectively redistribute body heat. in addition individuals who work outdoors the homeless and those who engage in outdoor activities are more likely to develop cold weather-related injuries due to their increased chance and time of of exposure to the cold conditions. alcohol and illicit drug use also make it more likely that individuals will develop a cold weather-related injury because these individuals have impaired judgment and they may not sense that they are in danger. patients with certain medical conditions including psychiatric illness circulatory problems diabetes scleroderma dehydration and smoking can develop a cold weather-related injury more quickly than other individuals. the prevention of cold weather-related injuries is best achieved through careful pre-planning and preparation for the cold when possible. travel with another person in case an emergency occurs. take along an emergency kit and blankets in your car in case of a breakdown or accident. dress warmly using multiple layers and adequately cover body areas prone to injury. try to have an extra change of dry clothing so you can remove any wet clothing if necessary. always keep your hands and feet dry and avoid wearing tight fitting clothing on these areas as it may decrease the circulation. use waterproof shoes. drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol caffeinated drinks and smoking. carry high-calorie snacks to provide adequate nutrition. most importantly however move indoors to a warmer environment when you begin to feel cold."

    "Answer": "this is a good question and you're wise to think in terms of avoiding the spread of any contagious condition. the good news is perioral dermatitis isn't contagious. dermatitis means skin (derm) inflammation (itis). because dermatitis is simply an inflammation of the skin (though it's often accompanied by cracking and flaking) it's not something you spread to someone else. the \"perioral\" part of your diagnosis merely denotes the location of the dermatitis. \"peri\" being \"around \" and \"oral\" being \"the mouth. \" skin inflammation around the mouth. that's all it is. all that said you still may want to keep your makeup brushes to yourself. cracked flaky inflamed skin creates a route for someone else's viruses (like oral herpes) or bacteria to enter your skin. you can't spread your dermatitis to someone else but that doesn't mean someone else couldn't spread an infection to you. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "teen with breast lump. i am fourteen yeears old and i have a hard-ish lump on the inside of my breast. i know it is normal for teens to get lumpy breasts at times but this is different. i also know that it is very rare for someone my age to get breast cancer. so i am just wondering if this is something i should get checked out or what it could possibly be. any insight into this would be really helpful! thanks!",
    "Answer": "you are correct. it would be highly unusual (never seen it in fact) for a 14 year old to have a breast cancer so the most logical lump for you to have would be a cyst. some can be very firm (fibrocystic mass) and many will seem to change in size around your menstrual period. it would be best to have any lump or mass properly examined so a visit to your primary care medical provider is indicated. you are to be complimented for being aware of these changes. first let me say good for you for noticing this lump. also you're very well-informed for your age which will help you better manage your health and wellness. bravo! you're right that it's not unusual for developing breasts to feel lumpy. you're also right that breast cancer is rare in your age group. but you still should get that lump checked out. for one thing you'll have some peace of mind. for another thing your health care provider can further educate you about what to expect as your breasts continue to develop. i recommend you make an appointment soon with your primary care provider. he or she can help you figure out what's going on here. best wishes to you!"

    "Question": "why does my neurologist do that?",
    "Answer": "one thing i've realized over the last few years---we (neurologists) do all these \"things\" during our examination of a patient and we almost never explain what we are doing. so i thought i would post some explanation of what we are doing when we look in your eyes or \"tickle\" your feet. eye examination : \"watch my finger\" is a test to look at how the eye muscles move the eye and lets me evaluate how the nerves that move these muscles work (the cranial nerves 3 4 and 6). we also look for abnormal eye movements that can be seen in some diseases. we look at how the pupil works (another reflex) which is controlled by the brainstem. we also look into the eye--the retina at the back of the eye is living nerve tissue and we can actually look at it and observe its health. face we ask you to smile to watch how the facial muscles (controlled by the facial nerve cranial nerve 7) work and make sure both sides move the same way. sometimes we ask patients to \"close your eye\" to look at the same nerve function. \"stick out your tongue and say ahh\" lets us look at cranial nerve 12 (tongue muscles) and the muscles in the back of the throat. (your family md is often just looking for a sore throat) muscles neurologists do a lot of tests for muscle strength in the arms and legs. we are looking for any signs of weakness in the muscles. the pattern of which muscles are weak helps us tell how well the brain spinal cord and nerves are working. for example---if the weakness is one arm and leg on the same side we worry mostly about a brain problem like stroke. these is the part of the examination where we ask the patient to squeeze our hands make a muscle stand on there toes etc. balance: we often ask patients to do some crazy sounding things while standing or walking like \"stand on one foot with your eyes closed\" or \"walk on your heels now on your toes\". these are all tests of balance and coordination and help us understand how part of the brain is working. some diseases of the brain mainly affect balance and coordination (and some things like alcohol do as well which is why the police \"borrowed\" that part of the neurologic examination to use on the roadside) reflexes: about half of my patients giggle when i tap their knee and make their leg twitch. this is a normal muscle reflex and tells me a lot about the health of the nerves in the leg and the back. we can get the same reflex by tapping on the back of the ankle (achilles tendon) or the inside of the elbow (biceps tendon) or the back of the elbow (triceps tendon). the \"tickling\" of the foot is actually supposed to be scrapping something along the bottom of the foot. in normal people not much happens (or the toes curl down). in people with a brain problem the first toe (big toe) points up when we scrape on the sole of the foot. this is called babinski's sign. babies have a babinski's sign because their spinal cord and brain are still maturing. hope this is helpful."

    "Answer": "it is possible to go through premature menopause before 40 but only a doctor can say for sure. weight gain especially in the midsection is related to menopause because the ovaries no longer produce estrogen and this changes the way fat is metabolized. hemorrhoids are not commonly associated with menopause and can happen to anyone especially if they are inactive drink little water and consume a diet low in fiber. not getting your periods is a serious manner so i highly recommend you see a doctor to rule out menopause or other health issues that could be going on. don't delay! for more on premature menopause see this webmd article"

    "Question": "what can i do to treat ringworm of the scalp or beard at home?",
    "Answer": "you usually treat ringworm of the scalp or beard with antifungal pills prescribed by a doctor. shampoos available without a prescription are helpful if you use them along with prescription pills. but when they are used alone they cannot completely destroy all of the fungi causing the infection. if you have ringworm of the scalp or beard: be sure to complete the full course of any prescribed medicine or follow the directions for products available without a prescription. they often require use for a period of time after symptoms go away. wash your hair or beard 2 or 3 times a week with shampoo that contains selenium sulfide or ketoconazole. in severe scalp fungal infections wash your scalp daily and wear a cap. you should boil the cap after you use it. 2 as soon as you start treatment throw away your combs and brushes and buy new ones. you will most likely see your doctor again after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. your doctor will also want to see you after you have finished all your medicine. follow the suggestions for preventing ringworm such as keeping your skin clean and dry and not sharing hats combs or brushes with others. ask your doctor whether your family members need to be tested. family members can use an antifungal shampoo with selenium sulfide in it (such as selsun blue or head and shoulders intensive treatment) to prevent the spread of infection. you do not need to keep your child out of school if he or she is taking pills to treat ringworm of the scalp. although parents sometimes use a special shampoo to help prevent the spread to other children it is not needed. and you do not need to shave your child's head. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "condoms are good protection; not perfect of course for certain types of stds like herpes or hpv but pretty-good. having sexual relationships with a prostitute (the real name for your massage girl) certainly increases your risk but since you are not showing any signs of an std in the last two weeks it is your fear and anxiety (and perhaps a little guilt) that is driving you crazy. see a medical provider and be perfectly honest and open about the details. don't be embarrassed. be up front. have a good examination and a bank of screening tests for the most common stds. sometime later (your doctor will tell you when) you may need to repeat those tests to be extra-sure. there is no way to determine specific risks since you do not know the std status of this prostitute. they tend to get tested quite frequently too since passing on stds are bad for the \"massage\" business she is conducting. you were sold a \"happy ending\" but i hope in your case the happy ending does not result in sad consequences."

    "Question": "busted head open now have 8 stitches. tylenol isn't helping not allowed to take anything with aspirin. what can i try? . the emergency room staff did not prescribe anything for the pain. they said take tylenol and stay away from aspirin. the tylenol is not helping. what over the counter pain reliever can i try?",
    "Answer": "you should just take the tylenol like your doctor suggested. medications like ibuprofen and aleve all have the potential of causing bleeding (just like aspirin). there is nothing over the counter. if you need something stronger than tylenol you will need to contact your medical provider for a prescription; perhaps one that has codeine."

    "Answer": "usually a pap smear is not longer needed after a complete hysterectomy. a pap smear is taken from the cervix to look for cancerous cells and other microscopic pathology (infections etc. o so you will not have a cervix. you will still however have a vagina so it is important to have a periodic pelvic examination (without a pap) to look for any other gynecological problems some that can occur as you age or post-surgical. depending on your age or the type of surgery you may still have your ovaries so a routine pelvic exam is important to check for any ovarian problems."

    "Question": "how should frostbite and other cold weather-related injuries be treated?",
    "Answer": "the initial treatment for any cold weather-related injury involves removing yourself or others from the precipitating cold environment if possible to prevent further heat loss. move indoors and remove all wet clothing and constricting clothing (such as socks boots and gloves) and replace with dry clothing. avoid massaging or rubbing the affected area as this will only aggravate the injury. it is important to note that some of these individuals may also be suffering from hypothermia a potentially life-threatening condition. chilblains gradually re-warm the affected area and treatment can generally be accomplished at home. some individuals may benefit from various lotions while others may require treatment with corticosteroid creams. if open sores develop they should remain clean and be monitored for signs of infection. trench foot individuals with trench foot should have their wet shoes and socks removed and the feet should be elevated cleaned and air dried. depending on the severity of the condition some individuals may require antibiotics and/or surgical management of infection or wet gangrene (tissue destruction by bacterial infection usually clostridium spp). frostnip frostnip will generally improve with conservative re-warming measures at home. frostnip to the hands for example can be treated by breathing into cupped hands or placing the hands in the armpit area. alternatively the affected area can be submerged in warm water until normal sensation is restored. frostbite frostbite requires immediate medical attention. ideally treatment should be instituted in a health-care facility when possible. prior to transport to a health-care facility if possible loosely wrap the affected area in a dry sterile bandage or a clean blanket to prevent further trauma. cotton may be placed between the toes or fingers if affected to prevent any potential damaging effects of rubbing against one another. the most effective treatment measure for frostbite is rapid re-warming. this is accomplished by immersing the affected area into a circulating tub of warmed water that is between 40 to 42 c (104 to 108 f) for 20 to 40 minutes or until thawing is complete. warm wet packs at the same temperature may be used if a tub is not available. it is important not to rapidly re-warm and thaw the affected area if there is a risk that it may refreeze. this leads to more severe tissue damage and must be avoided. during the re-warming process the pain may be extreme and oral or intravenous analgesics may be required. after rapid re-warming is complete the affected area should be dressed and splinted. further treatment will focus on wound care (debriding clear blisters applying aloe vera lotion and monitoring for infection) pain control and providing a tetanus vaccine booster shot if needed. surgical consultation may be obtained for managing wound care as well as for the longer-term sequelae of serious frostbite injuries that my require amputation of gangrenous tissue."

    "Question": "what types of crowns are available?",
    "Answer": "permanent crowns can be made from all metal porcelain-fused-to-metal all resin or all ceramic. metals used in crowns include gold alloy other alloys (for example palladium) or a base-metal alloy (for example nickel or chromium). compared with other crown types less tooth structure needs to be removed with metal crowns and tooth wear to opposing teeth is kept to a minimum. metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. also metal crowns rarely chip or break. the metallic color is the main drawback. metal crowns are a good choice for out-of-sight molars. porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns can be color matched to your adjacent teeth (unlike the metallic crowns). however more wearing to the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or resin crowns. the crown's porcelain portion can also chip or break off. next to all-ceramic crowns porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns look most like normal teeth. however sometimes the metal underlying the crown's porcelain can show through as a dark line especially at the gum line and even more so if your gums recede. these crowns can be a good choice for front or back teeth. all-resin dental crowns are less expensive than other crown types. however they wear down over time and are more prone to fractures than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. all-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide the best natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies. however they are not as strong as porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and they wear down opposing teeth a little more than metal or resin crowns. all-ceramic crowns are a good choice for front teeth. temporary versus permanent. temporary crowns can be made in your dentist's office whereas permanent crowns are made in a dental laboratory. temporary crowns are made of acrylic or stainless steel and can be used as a temporary restoration until a permanent crown is constructed by the dental laboratory."

    "Question": "both my husband and i have been out of work for years. we own too much to get medicaid. . how are we supposed to get health insurance so that we don't have to pay the $984 fine? that's $984 per person. the federal government told me we could use \"low cost clinics \" but that's not health insurance so we'll still be responsible for this penalty. so what's the point of this law? how can they make people who are out of work pay even more money that they don't have?",
    "Answer": "the fine is either $95 per person/$285 for a family (not $984) or 1% of your annual household income whichever is greater. even if you haven't qualified for medicaid before you might now. the law expands the guidelines making it possible for a couple earning up to roughly $21 000 annually to get medicaid coverage. of course many states aren't expanding the program. if you live in one that is not you'll still want to shop on the marketplace for insurance because you'll likely qualify for a substantial subsidy to lower the cost of coverage. if medicaid isn't an option and you can't find a plan that costs you less than 8% of your income you won't be penalized for not having insurance."

    "Answer": "the law makes available financial assistance for people with low and middle incomes. if you're not working you'll likely either qualify for medicaid (if you live in a state expanding its program) or highly subsidized health insurance. if medicaid is not available to you where you live and you are unable to afford insurance even with subsidies (meaning the lowest priced health plan costs more than 8% of your income) you will not be penalized for failing to have health insurance."

    "Answer": "i imagine you are talking about a condition called pneumothorax. the lung isn't literally exploding but a hole forms in the lung and in the lining of the lung. air can then escape out into the area surrounding the lung. the problem is this air outside the lungs puts pressure on the lungs. the lungs then can't expand and fill with oxygen. that can make getting enough oxygen in the body very difficult. when people are on a ventilator the machine is pushing air into the lungs so the chance of this happening is always higher. that's because of the pressure that can build up in the lungs. while the respiratory therapist and the doctors adjust the machine to keep the pressures down as much as possible this can still happen. the longer someone is on a ventilator the more likely problems such as this are likely to occur."

    "Question": "should my child's cholesterol be checked?",
    "Answer": "should every child be screened for high cholesterol? that’s an issue currently up for debate. the current recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics say no. as it stands right now there are only certain children who are screened. those include: * children who have a parent or grandparent diagnosed with heart disease at or under 55 years of age. * children who have a parent or grandparent who have had a heart attack heart-related chest pain vascular disease or sudden cardiac death at or under 55 years of age. * children who have a parent with an elevated blood cholesterol level of 240 mg/dl or higher. * children who are diagnosed with obesity. but a recent study questions if practitioners are missing a significant number of children who might be identified with elevated cholesterol levels. having that awareness might encourage families to be stricter about enforcing a healthy diet and exercise routine. and some kids might actually need to be treated with cholesterol-lowering medications. the study found that almost 10 percent of kids who would not be tested under the current guidelines have elevated levels of ldl cholesterol. bottom line: just relying on a family’s history of high cholesterol may be an insufficient screening tool to determine who needs a blood cholesterol level drawn. but even if your child has not been diagnosed with high cholesterol it’s a good idea for everyone to follow the advice of the american heart association — maintain a low-fat diet for all kids ages two and up. and encourage your whole family to take time for exercise every day."

    "Answer": "if you are talking about milk as in breast milk or formula then yes an infant can take this while on tamiflu or just about any medication. my biggest question would be why is the infant taking tamiflu? it is usually not recommend or used in children under age one according to the literature. i special cases i assume it could be used (although i have never used this drug in this age group) but it has not been well-tested for safety in infants."

    "Answer": "because of your history of anorexia its best to see someone who specializes in eating disorders to rule out relapse. even if you feel this is not the case doing so is in your best interest. if that leaves you with no answers you can get a physical to check the potential medical reasons for decreased appetite. for now when you do have an appetite take advantage of it. if breakfast is when you are the most hungry eat a full big breakfast. notice times your appetite changes and follow along. consider adding frequent meals throughout the day. meditation and mindfulness also can help. take care of yourself. anorexia with unintentional weight loss should not be ignored. this can be due to some severe ailment/condition. better visit your physician and get yourself checked up."

    "Answer": "assuming you are female (boys do not bother to wipe) you should wipe front to back basically pushing the toilet tissue into the toilet. if you wipe back to front you could be contaminating your vaginal area with bacteria that may have colonized around your rectal area. when i instruct little children i tell them to \"push the paper into the potty\"; never pull it \"out of the potty\". since most urinary tract infections in women are caused from bacteria that normally live in the rectum/colon proper bathroom hygiene is an important skill to learn and to practice. wipe from front to back after using the bathroon. the reasoning for this is to help prevent urinary tract infections. try not to reach from behind because this could transfer germs from the rectum to your hands and the opening of the urethra as you wipe. use the same direction when washing or showering. after a bowel movement also wipe the from the front of the rectum to the back. this answer is from diapering baby the healthy way but the same is true for adults. women particularly should wipe from front to back to avoid infection. hope this helps! the webmd answers staff it is front to back to avoid bladder infections."

    "Answer": "the ana (antinuclear antibody. ) is a blood test that when positive is associated with autoimmune diseases the prototype of which is lupus (sle). a + test by itself (titer >1:160) does not define sle since one needs to have the signs and symptoms associated with the disease. thus the test has to be interpreted in the context of the individual as evaluated by the doctor. the test can be falsely + i. e. + in a patient who does not have the disease (about 10%) or + in other conditions such as scleroderma sjogren's syndrome to name a few. if the test is negative the likelihood is that you do not have lupus since there are way fewer false negatives than false positives. if your doctor however thinks that you do have lupus (by signs and symptoms) despite the negative ana some other tests may be done by your md. finally the ana test is not done to follow the activity of the disease so it is unneccessary to continue to repeat it. ."

    "Answer": "those are signs of a continuing or recurrent yeast infection so you may need that difucan again. i am surprised that the cream was not helpful so perhaps your medical provider can suggest a different topical or vaginal medication for you to use."

    "Answer": "bacterial vaginosis is vaginal condition that can produce vaginal discharge and results from an overgrowth of normal bacteria in the vagina. in the past the condition was called gardnerella vaginitis after the bacteria that were thought to cause the condition. however the newer name bacterial vaginosis reflects the fact that there are a number of species of bacteria that naturally live in the vaginal area and may grow to excess. the gardnerella organism is not the sole culprit causing the symptoms. when these multiple species of bacteria become imbalanced a woman can have a vaginal discharge with a foul odor. bacterial vaginosis is not dangerous but it can cause disturbing symptoms. any woman with an unusual discharge should be evaluated so that more serious infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can be excluded. symptoms may also mimic those found in yeast infections of the vagina and trichomoniasis (a sexually-transmitted infection) and these conditions must also be excluded in women with vaginal symptoms. bacterial vaginosis is a common condition and studies have shown that approximately 29% of women in the us are affected. bacterial vaginosis is found in about 16% of pregnant women and approximately 60% of women who have a sexually-transmitted disease (std)."

    "Answer": "ok so let's back up a moment and run through what shingles is how it gets transmitted and what effect it has on different groups of people. shingles is caused by the varicella virus. this is the same virus that causes chickenpox. you cannot get shingles unless you have had chickenpox. if you have had chickenpox you cannot \"catch\" shingles from coming in contact with someone who has shingles. however people who never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated for it can get chickenpox by coming into contact with the active (weeping) blisters of someone with shingles. once the blisters crust over they're generally considered to be non-infectious. it's uncommon for people to develop chickenpox from exposure to shingles under any circumstances and i would think it nearly impossible under the circumstances you describe. i can understand why you feel the need to take serious precautions but i think your loved ones can rest easy. i doubt you could \"carry\" the shingles virus to them especially from indirect contact with someone whose rash is at least two weeks old. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "could my previous method of birth control affect my fertility?",
    "Answer": "we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail; now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well. could there be long-term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving? let's review them briefly and put your mind at ease. 1. combined hormonal methods (e. g. birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring). these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility. we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle (whatever that means for you) within 3 months of stopping all of these methods. 2. progesterone only methods (the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant). we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months. the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due (since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot). again no long term impact on fertility 3. intrauterine device (iud). the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility (which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available). although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4. diaphragms condoms and spermicides. these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them. condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well. so where are the concerns regarding fertility? some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility. for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth. . the methods of birth control generally donot affects the fertility."

    "Question": "what are the fitness benefits of aerobic exercise?",
    "Answer": "how our bodies adapt here's what happens inside your body when you do aerobic exercise regularly: 1. your heart gets stronger and pumps more blood with each beat (larger stroke volume). elite athletes can have stroke volumes more than twice as high as average individuals. but it's not just that. conditioned hearts also have greater diameter and mass (the heart's a muscle too and gets bigger when you train it) and they pump efficiently enough to allow for greater filling time which is a good thing because it means that more blood fills the chambers of the heart before they pump so that more blood gets pumped with each beat. 2. greater stroke volume means the heart doesn't have to pump as fast to meet the demands of exercise. fewer beats and more stroke volume mean greater efficiency. think about a pump emptying water out of a flooded basement. the pump works better and lasts longer if it can pump larger volumes of water with each cycle than if it has to pump faster and strain to get rid of the water. high stroke volume is why athletes' hearts don't pump as fast during exercise and why they have such low resting heart rates; sometimes as low as 40 beats per minute whereas the average is 60-80 beats per minutes! 3. downstream from the heart are your muscles which get more efficient at consuming oxygen when you do regular aerobic exercise. this happens because of an increase in the activity and number of enzymes that transport oxygen into the muscle. imagine 100 oxygen molecules circulating past a muscle. you're twice as fit if the muscle can consume all 100 molecules than if it can only consume 50. another way of saying it is that you're twice as fit as someone if your vo 2 max is 60ml/kg/min and theirs is 30ml/kg/min. in terms of performance in this scenario you'll have more endurance because your muscles won't run out of oxygen as quickly. 4. mitochondria inside the muscle increase in number and activity. mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. they do all the heavy-duty work to keep you moving. they use the oxygen to burn the fat and carbohydrate that makes you go. you'd be nowhere without mitochondria! the good news is that they increase in number and activity by as much as 50% in just a matter of days to weeks in response to regular aerobic exercise in adults of all ages. burn baby burn fat and carbohydrate are the fuels our muscles burn. the difference between them is that fat is high-test; it contains 9 calories per gram whereas carbohydrate has only 4 and so you get more energy and can go farther on a gram of fat than on a gram of carbohydrate. you want to burn fat because it's such an efficient fuel plus it's nice to lose some of your excess fat! the catch is that you need more oxygen to burn fat because it's denser than carbohydrate. the good news is that your body gets better at using oxygen and burning fat when you do regular aerobic exercise; your heart pumps more blood your muscles consume more oxygen and you have more mitochondria. regular aerobic exercise has the potential to turn you into a lean mean fat-burning machine!"

    "Question": "can you get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery?",
    "Answer": "assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery."

    "Question": "i was diagnosed with mrsa in mid sept on my nose. why does the healed spot still hurt and tingle/ich? . i just finished my third round of zyvox. i don't know if the pain may be side effects of the drug or if the mrsa still hasn't gone away.",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're dealing with this. the issue of mrsa (methicillin-resistant streptococcus aureaus) infection continues to grow as a public health concern. as you've learned it can take multiple rounds of antibiotics to treat mrsa. because only the infected spot on your nose is itching i doubt what you're experiencing is a side effect of medication. i guess my point is it's impossible to say what's causing the itching and tingling without a physical examination. if you're scheduled for follow-up with your health care provider you are probably safe to take a wait-and-see approach with this as long as you don't develop a fever or additional symptoms (increased redness/swelling/heat at the infection site feeling like you're coming down with the flu -- that sort of thing). if you don't already have a follow-up appointment scheduled i'd suggest making one. you and your doctor want to be sure that infection is well and truly gone. in the meantime be sure take precautions against spreading any possible remaining infection by washing your hands often and thoroughly; not sharing towels or clothing that may have touched the infected spot; and routinely disinfecting routinely touched surfaces by using antimicrobial wipes or something similar. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "opting out of chemotherapy after having total stomach removal due to stomach cancer? . my mother had the earliest stage of stomach cancer and had her total stomach removed and no signs of cancer anywhere else. she is 75 years old and opted out of further treatment. will she do ok with keeping up with the 3 month ct scans and lab work? she still has the feeding tube attached in case in 3 months chemotherapy is necessary",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear of your mother's cancer but am happy to learn it was discovered early and had not spread elsewhere in her body. that is very good news! when you ask \"will she do ok \" i think you mean \"will she survive? \" it's impossible to answer that question. when a person gets cancer there is always a chance of it spreading or returning whether or not they receive additional treatment like chemotherapy. your mother is not very elderly at age 75 but it sounds like she has made a choice in favor of quality of life. this is certainly her decision to make. you can give your mom peace of mind by being very supportive of her choice. do not feel if the cancer returns that she made a 'mistake' by opting out of chemotherapy. having the drug treatment may not have kept any future cancer away anyway. enjoy the time you have together now and try not to worry too much about what tomorrow holds. your mother may outlive us all! wishing you and your mother well."

    "Question": "i’m having extreme gi issues during and after i run. my stomach kills and i feel extremely nauseous. what is wrong?",
    "Answer": "i'm not sure why this is happening but it is common. dairy is certainly a possible culprit but you say you've cut it out before you run. here are some additional tips. 1. avoid caffeine and warm fluids. they can increase intestinal motility. 2. limit high-fiber foods. you may want to track the food you eat the day before too. 3. avoid any other foods that you know upset your stomach or give you gas. 4. stay well hydrated (dehydration slows digestion of food and cause stomach problems). i recommend 16-20 ounces of water 60-90 minutes before you run and 8-10 ounces every 20 minutes during the run. importantly avoid replacement beverages like gatorade since the sugar can increase motility. 6. avoid aspirin ibuprofen products with sorbitol or large doses of vitamin c. all of these can cause diarrhea or otherwise upset your stomach. 7. try a bland food like half a bagel and nothing else 30-45 minutes before you train. 8. pepto bismol can help too. 9. if possible empty your bowel before you run. if it continues you should consult your doctor to rule out any medical problem."

    "Answer": "due to heavy work many of them are not going to their bed at the right time but are waking at earlier hours. this effects very badly on our health conditions and may be lead to many health problems. so it is better to sleep somewhat earlier and do practice some exercise as your body can feel tired and you may get good sleep. this can rid of the problem from dark circles and you also had an option of some natural products usage for the problem you are suffering. because of natural products you can get relief and gain more confidence."

    "Question": "what does it mean if my urine is bright yellow?",
    "Answer": "well that's difficult to say. it probably means nothing. yellow is the color we expect urine to be. if you take a vitamin supplement these can sometimes give the urine an almost fluorescent color a very bright yellow or yellow-green. that's just due to the dyes in the vitamin. if you've eaten anything recently with yellow dye in it that could also be a reason for bright yellow urine. sometimes very colorful urine indicates dehydration. the more concentrated urine is the darker or richer the color of it is. if you have no other symptoms such as pain with urination abdominal pain or lower back pain your bright yellow urine probably doesn't mean anything in terms of your overall health. if you develop any problems urinating or if the bright color persists then by all means consult a medical professional. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "how can i do kegel exercises during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "remember: before you start any exercise program consult with your health care provider. your health care provider can give you personal exercise guidelines based on your medical history. kegel exercises help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder uterus and bowels. by strengthening these muscles during your pregnancy you can develop the ability to relax and control the muscles in preparation for labor and birth. kegel exercises are also highly recommended during the postpartum period to promote the healing of perineal tissues increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles and help these muscles return to a healthy state and also increase urinary control. to do kegels imagine you are trying to stop the flow of urine or trying not to pass gas. when you do this you are contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor and are practicing kegel exercises. while doing kegel exercises try not to move your leg buttock or abdominal muscles. in fact no one should be able to tell that you are doing kegel exercises. so you can do them anywhere! we recommend doing five sets of kegel exercises a day. each time you contract the muscles of the pelvic floor hold for a slow count of five and then relax. repeat this ten times for one set of kegels."

    "Answer": "i cannot estimate the likelihood of herpes transmission since there are just too many variables. some people shed herpes virus even when they do not have an obvious herpetic lesion. as a rule do not have oral sex with anyone when you have or recently-had a cold sore (herpes simplex). there is really nothing you can do about it after the act other than wait. and hope that you did not transmit this herpetic virus. if you did she will most certainly let you know."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your baby is going through this. good for you for following the instructions to the letter in using the inhaler. it's very important to use all medications for infants exactly as prescribed. because your baby has developed new symptoms you should take her back to the pediatrician. although this may sound like the \"same\" cough as before her persistent coughing could be a sign of something else going on. your pediatrician will want to examine her and perhaps run additional tests to look for answers. meanwhile i would call the pediatrician's office to ask whether it is ok to continue using the inhaler. generally doctors like to see the patient when she is exhibiting symptoms. it may be uncomfortable for your baby to be coughing a lot but it also may be important for the doctor to see this during the examination. your pediatrician's office will guide you as to whether or not to treat the cough between now and your visit. wishing you well! really very sorry to hear what you and your child is going through at this age. i will say do follow what your doctor has said. for more information on many other inhalers you can visit pharmacysell."

    "Answer": "i agree with your doctor. your blood pressure is within normal range for your age. one reading is really not enough to make any generalizations so it is important that you get your blood pressure taken several times a month. better yet. buy your own blood pressure device and take your own readings."

    "Question": "how does crohn's disease affect the intestines?",
    "Answer": "in the early stages crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) on the inner surface of the bowel. these erosions are called aphthous ulcers. with time the erosions become deeper and larger ultimately becoming true ulcers (which are deeper than erosions) and causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel. as the disease progresses the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed and ultimately can become obstructed. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the wall of the bowel and bacteria from within the bowel can spread to infect adjacent organs and the surrounding abdominal cavity. when crohn's disease narrows the small intestine to the point of obstruction the flow of the contents through the intestine ceases. sometimes the obstruction can be caused suddenly by poorly digestible fruit or vegetables that plug the already narrowed segment of the intestine. when the intestine is obstructed digesting food fluid and gas from the stomach and the small intestine cannot pass into the colon. the symptoms of small intestinal obstruction then appear including severe abdominal cramps nausea vomiting and abdominal distention. obstruction of the small intestine is much more likely since the small intestine is much narrower than the colon to begin with. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the walls of the small intestine and the colon and create a tunnel between the intestine and adjacent organs. if the ulcer tunnel reaches an adjacent empty space inside the abdominal cavity a collection of infected pus (an abdominal abscess) is formed. patients with abdominal abscesses can develop tender abdominal masses high fevers and abdominal pain. when the ulcer tunnels into an adjacent organ a channel (fistula) is formed. the formation of a fistula between the intestine and the bladder (enteric-vesicular fistula) can cause frequent urinary tract infections and the passage of gas and feces during urination. when a fistula develops between the intestine and the skin (enteric-cutaneous fistula) pus and mucous emerge from a small painful opening on the skin of the abdomen. the development of a fistula between the colon and the vagina (colonic-vaginal fistula) causes gas and feces to emerge through the vagina. the presence of a fistula from the intestines to the anus (anal fistula) leads to a discharge of mucous and pus from the fistula's opening around the anus."

    "Question": "what is ketoconazole 2% cream used for?",
    "Answer": "generally speaking when you encounter a medication with \"azole\" in the name you can be pretty sure it's an antifungal medication. that means it's used to treat fungal infections such as athlete's foot ringworm and yeast infections of the skin. the 2% designation indicates the amount of the active ingredient (ketoconazole) contained in the cream. very often topical medications (that is creams ointments) come in a variety of strengths. you should use a prescription cream exactly as directed. obviously you should never eat it. and don't use it on any mucous membranes (such as the vaginal area) unless directed to do so. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "no vaccine is 100% effective. unfortunately it is possible for someone who is immunized to still get measles. your child is as protected as any child who is immunized so exposure is really unknown. parks like disneyland have tens of thousands of adults and children touching everything and breathing on each other. many park goers are not immunized and do not practice good hygiene so you take that chance. you also take a similar chance sending him to day-care taking him to the mall etc. disneyland is clean but the people who go there may not be as clean or disease-free. this recent outbreak is distressing since measles is preventable if everyone does their part by being adequately vaccinated. the more people who are vaccinated the less chance of any of these outbreaks. as a parent only you can make this decision. since he is only three you will have ample time in the future to go when this outbreak is controlled or over. if you decide to go statistically he will most likely be fine but remember there is no 100% certainty."

    "Answer": "home pregnancy tests are very accurate so it's unlikely that you were pregnant before especially if you were at least 7 to 10 days late for your period. chapped lips aren't a common pregnancy symptom but it sounds like you had this issue before. given the recurring problem with your period and the other symptoms you're having i would not assume this is pregnancy. it's worth a visit to your doctor to find out what's going on. there's no harm in taking another pregnancy test but if it's negative call your doctor so you can find out what's going on."

    "Answer": "prostatitis should not cause redness/soreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct. there is likely another cause. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet based solely on your very brief description. you will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this redness/soreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis. you may want to consider seeing a urologist."

    "Question": "dry skin like a scab under my eye. i can peel it off and it will come back within a day. sometimes flaky. . for almost 2 years now i have had this constant dry flaking/peeling skin on my eyelid on one eye and under my eye on the other. it hardens like a scab but is just a thick layer of skin that is rough when it is un-cracked. when it starts cracking i can peel this layer off and it appears a little red under that skin peel. sometimes it is a little itchy or has a burning sensation. i went to a dermatologist to have them look at it they tested it and said it was benign and to put moisturizer on it.",
    "Answer": "a new pillow and a week of cleaning eye lids and area around them. cover with wet warm tea bags for 10 min or tea oil. cleared mine up. also use baby shampoo. shampoos can irritate & cause your eyes to be puffy red & cause a lot of flaking especially around the eyes & on the face."

    "Question": "what happens when you don't treat anemia?",
    "Answer": "i think it would be helpful to understand exactly what anemia is. anemia is the medical term for the inability of red blood cells to transport oxygen molecules to the tissues of the body. anemia can be caused by either a lack of red blood cells (such as from excessive bleeding) or from a lack of hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen). when a person has anemia their organs muscles nerves and other tissues are not receiving enough oxygen to function well. usually a person with anemia feels very \"run down. \" many people experience episodes of mild to moderate anemia due to temporary situations like heavy menstrual bleeding. because this type of anemia is caused by some sort of brief episode that brings about the condition the body often can rebound by producing additional red blood cells to correct the problem. sometimes however anemia is caused by a long-term medical condition that doesn't allow the body to \"catch up\" its red blood cell production. an example of this type of anemia is sickle cell anemia. this inherited disorder causes many red blood cells to be malformed and unable to transport oxygen. this is not a situation the body can correct by making more cells. so to answer your question untreated anemia can have a serious impact on a person's health depending on the cause. if a person has a chronic anemia they could actually die from the disease. and that would be a shame because most anemias can be managed with medications and supplements. if you have anemia or know someone you think may have it i suggest you visit a health care practitioner for a simple blood test and treatment. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "glycerine suppositories are safe to use on a long term basis but they do not soften hard stools -- it just lubricates the rectal area to make it easier for you to pass a hard dry stool. if you want to soften your stools you need to take a stool softener to prevent your stools becoming hard. one of the best is miralax or the generic equivalent. stool softeners are not habitual and are also safe to use for long-term use. in addition you should be eating plenty of vegetables and fruit and drinking sufficient water. one reason your stools are hard is because your body is drawing out the liquid in your colon because you are not drinking enough."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. the good news is it's probably not serious. if this were appendicitis the pain would be on the right side not the left and it would be pretty ouchy. it likely wouldn't be something described as \"mild pain. \" sometimes when a person becomes active as you have they get very in tune with their body -- and that can magnify their perception of even minor changes twinges in their state of being. it's not unusual for a person to experience minor aches and pains throughout any given day. it could be you simply never noticed these things before and now you do. another possibility is gas passing through the large intestine or even a piece of hard stool moving along. these situations can produce a mild pain in the left abdominal area. the fatigue and lightheadedness could be mild dehydration or (as you suspected) some sort of fluctuation in your blood sugar levels. if the pain persists or if you develop a fever then you should see a doctor. and by the way keep up the great work with healthy eating and exercising. it sounds like you've really been making an effort. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "sex workers no matter what they charge have a higher incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases when compared to the general population. multiple partners infrequent testing and pre-existing stds that may not be obvious at the time of exposure are the greatest risks that one might encounter. whether you were exposed to one or more of the array of stds out there is anyone's guess. your concern should have been raised before seeking sexual contact with a prostitute but of course that is a bit too late now. testing may or may not reveal exposure or diseases in there incubation process but i think that it would be wise to be tested based on your level of worry over this incident."

    "Answer": "first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care!"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer yes you can. in fact anyone who has had chicken pox can get shingles in the future. that's because shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. like chicken pox shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus. once the virus has gotten into your body it gives you chicken pox. after you've recovered from chicken pox the varicella zoster virus lies dormant (inactive) in your system. if it ever re-activates it causes shingles. shingles can occur any people of any age but the rate of shingles increases as you get older. according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) about half of all shingles cases occur in people over age 60. there is a vaccine available to protect people age 60 and over from getting shingles. if you do get shingles your doctor also can treat the symptoms of the outbreak with various medications. if you're over age 60 i suggest you talk with your health care provider about whether or not the shingles vaccine is right for you. hope this helps! yes anyone who has had the chicken box can get shingles. yes! you don't want shingles believe me it is horrible. get the shot."

(this crown-to-rump length is used more often than crown-to-heel length because the baby's legs are most often bent and hard to measure). the eyes and limb buds also are forming. a heartbeat can sometimes be detected by an ultrasound around now. this is also an extremely important time in the development of your baby since between 17 and 56 days the embryo is most susceptible to factors that can interfere with its normal growth. mom-to-be : you may have gained a few pounds by now but if you're experiencing morning sickness you may have lost weight which is also normal. you're starting to notice some changes in your body: clothes getting a little tighter around the waist weight gain in your legs and breasts. with a pelvic exam your practitioner will be able to notice a change in the size of your uterus. tip for the week : make sure you're following good prenatal habits like eating right and taking your prenatal vitamins. since the neural tube (which is the beginning of the central nervous system) has formed by now taking folic acid to prevent spinal cord defects such as spina bifida has been crucial. if you haven't already stop smoking and drinking."

    "Question": "i suffer from social anxiety and overanalyze situations that are out of my control. can you offer some suggestions?",
    "Answer": "since you indicate that social anxiety seems to be a primary problem for you it would seem that working with a cognitive psychologist who could provide direction and structure regarding social situations would be a good idea. i'm thinking about a psychologist who would provide weekly homework assignments very simple at first so that you can begin to build your comfort in social situations. in my book i have at least one chapter devoted to this topic and you might want to stop by the library and take a look at it. socializing is a skill that all of us need to develop and you're right it doesn't come easily. i understand what you mean when you say you're fine but when you're about to meet new people you become anxious. that happens to a lot of people. you're also right that over analyzing just makes you feel worse and what you fear is happening probably isn't happening at all. i'm referring of course to thinking what people are thinking about you or what they might be saying war that you won't be able to hold your own in a conversation. everything can be handled with the right type of guidance. i think you should give therapy specifically cognitive therapy aimed at social anxiety another try."

    "Answer": "first it needs to be conclusively proven that he actually has shingles. the wrist is not a place one would usually see it since herpes zoster (the medical name for shingles) follows a nerve pathway. there are lab tests that can be done; ordered by his doctor including a direct herpes culture to any fresh sores that he may get. i see shingles quite several times a year in my pediatric practice. i can't say it is common but shingles does occur in children. as this point i would question the diagnosis since shingles also tends to break out in the exact same area each time. not on the shoulder once and then the wrist."

    "Question": "can hydrocodone cause lower blood pressure",
    "Answer": "in short yes it can. one of the known side effects of hydrocodone is lowered blood pressure. hydrocodone is an opioid medication. it works to relieve pain by occupying certain receptors within the nervous system. in general opioid medications tend to slow everything down; they can cause sleepiness slower breathing slower heart rate and yes lower blood pressure. however hydrocodone is prescribed for pain. it is not an antihypertensive drug per se. in other words it's not prescribed specifically to help lower blood pressure in a person with high blood pressure. that job is left to other medications designed for that purpose. if you're experiencing any intolerable side effects with your hydrocodone usage please consult with your health care provider. he or she can help you determine if another medication might work better for you with fewer side effects. good luck! yes but keep in mind most at least in the usa most formulations are mixed with something else and pure hydrocodone is hard to come by as they are all mixed with paracetamol aka acetaminophen or other durgs to \" decress retraction users\". acetaminophen which is shown at high dose or with frequent use can actually raid your blood pressure. there are other formulation with hydrococodne all have there risks but as more and more studies are finding acetaminophen use for long times or at high doses ( a few of the 500mg pills) can increase bp. just thought id trow that out there you can look it up if you need more confermation."

    "Answer": "any time an infant or toddler eats or drinks something that is not made for human consumption you should call the poison control hotline at 1-800-222-1222. write that phone number down and post it on your refrigerator for easy access! you should call your pediatrician for advice about your child's fever and runny nose. it's doubtful the plant food caused this but we are into flu season and flu can be very serious in a one-year-old. you need to get this situation assessed as soon as possible. if your baby is not eating or drinking take him to the emergency room. if your baby is not producing a wet diaper at least every 3 hours get him to the emergency room. plant food contains various chemicals that are highly unsafe for anyone to consume (eat/drink). these things also are unsafe for your pets to drink so you should find a way to prevent them from doing so. perhaps place a mesh cover over the christmas tree bowl so they cannot reach the water or something. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "yes i am sure you can find an orthopedic (hand) surgeon willing to do take a crack at it (no pun intended) but you could be asking for more trouble than it is worth. in order to get a better cosmetic result it will require a re-break and perhaps a pinning of the metacarpal in order to straighten out the bent digit. the orthopedist will tell you the pros and cons and hopefully your insurance company will be agreeable to paying for it."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. my concern is that you don't have shingles at all. normally shingles isn't described as \"hives all over the body\" that \"itch. \" in fact if you have welts on both sides of your body (as divided by the spinal column) then i can guarantee you do not have shingles. shingles only affects one side of the body at a time. even though you don't currently have health insurance i'd suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when you're having an outbreak of these hives. most communities have free or low-cost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance. you can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local medicaid office or by performing an internet search for \"free health clinic\" and your city name. i wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition!"

    "Question": "i had a stomach reaction to an antibiotic on mon. it has been mostly resolved thus is it okay if i eat chipotle? . went to the er on monday and was a confirmed reaction to an antibiotic. the stomach has been healing and all week i have stuck to a bland diet. i feel ready to move onto stronger food but just want to make sure it is okay considering the earlier reaction.",
    "Answer": "do you feel that your stomach can handle it? i would feel weak if i stuck to a bland diet for a week. but i don't know if the doctor who treated you for the reaction said for you to stay on a diet of bland foods for a week and slowly go to more or other foods. if you feel that you can handle the more spicy foods then i would. but eat in moderation. don't eat too much at one sitting eat just enough to feel full and not over do it. then your stomach will get stronger or you may have a relapse. so just don't over do it and not too much of spicy foods and then over time your stomach should get back to normal. but if you start throwing up running a fever feel nausea stop eating and go back to the er. you just might have a relapse and it could be worse. so only you know how much to eat and if you think you are going to get nausea then go back to the er. please let us know how you are doing. i do hope that you get to feeling better. thank you"

    "Question": "will gabapentin show up in a urine drug test? . taking urine drug test and was just prescibed gabapentin",
    "Answer": "gabapentin is not a narcotic. most urine drug tests are used to screen for the use of narcotics and illicit substances. so gabapentin usage should not be detected by a drug screen. gabapentin also is not a \"scheduled\" substance which means it's not as highly controlled as other prescription pain relievers. again most urine drug tests are designed to detect the illicit (unprescribed) use of narcotics scheduled substances (like benzodiazepines) and illegal substances (like marijuana). your gabapentin usage shouldn't influence a urine drug test in any way. yes neurotin is not a narcotic. however some drs or labs even using 9-13 panel drug screens will also flag a positive if neurotin is detected in the sample. trust me. i had one done 4 months ago and this dr didn't even know i was rx neurotin. results sent off came back and at the main bottom of the results in a small box it said gabapentin detected normal = negative results= (whatever number detected) i am trying to find out how long it stays in your system though. because it had been 21 days since i took the last one. my dr didn't believe me because she says it is out in 2-3 days. but i've yet to find any where that can answer this."

    "Answer": "have your husband pin down where the joint pain is. if it's in the hip there is a condition called avascular necrosis that can happen where the blood flow to the hip bone decreased due to hiv and/or the medications and the hip bone dies in the areas that aren't getting enough blood and oxygen. there is also something happening with people who have been living with hiv and on meds for many years called \"fragility syndrome\". the condition is poorly understood and we don't always know whether its a side effect of medications or the byproduct of long term inflammation from your body fighting the virus (yes even when on meds and undetectable) that causes accelerated arthritis heart disease and other conditions related to inflammation. have your husband go to his doctor and ask for either an x-ray of the area that is bothering him or what's called a dexa scan which will tell him and his doctor if he is experiencing some bone \"thinning\" (similar to osteoporosis that women have after menopause) as a result of hiv or the meds. if it is or even if it isn't it may be a good idea for him to be on calcium and vitamin d daily to help keep the calcium in his bones which will keep them strong!"

    "Answer": "i can't give you a very good answer because i'm not sure what you're basing your analysis on. did an ob-gyn or nurse-midwife tell you your baby's heartbeat was slow? if so the medical professional should have advised you about exactly what this means if anything about the health of your unborn child. be aware that a baby's heartbeat in the womb starts out very fast at around 180 beats per minute and then slows down into a range around 120-160 beats per minute for the rest of the pregnancy. so if you've noticed a decrease in heart rate around the 12th week of pregnancy this may be normal. i suggest you contact your health care provider to find out what a slow fetal heartbeat means in terms of potential miscarriage. wishing you and your baby all the best!"

    "Question": "what is a transient ischemic attack?",
    "Answer": "a transient ischemic attack (tia mini-stroke) is a short-lived stroke that gets better and resolves. it is a short-lived episode (less than 24 hours) of temporary impairment if brain function that is caused by a loss of blood supply. a tia causes a loss of function in the area of the body that is controlled by the portion of the brain affected. the loss of blood supply to the brain is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a blood vessel within the brain (thrombosis). however it can also result from a clot that forms elsewhere in the body dislodges from that location and travels to lodge in an artery of the brain (emboli). a spasm and rarely a bleed are other causes of a tia. many people refer to a tia as a \"mini-stroke. \" some tias develop slowly while others develop rapidly. by definition all tias resolve within 24 hours. strokes take longer to resolve than tias and with strokes complete function may never return and reflect a more permanent and serious problem. although most tias often last only a few minutes all tias should be evaluated with the same urgency as a stroke in an effort to prevent recurrences and/or strokes. tias can occur once multiple times or precede a permanent stroke. a transient ischemic attack should be considered an emergency because there is no guarantee that the situation will resolve and function will return. a tia from a clot in the blood vessel that supplies the retina of the eye can cause temporary visual loss (amaurosis fugax) which is often described as the sensation of a curtain coming down. a tia that involves the carotid artery (the largest blood vessel supplying the brain) can produce problems with movement or sensation on one side of the body which is the side opposite to the actual blockage. an affected patient may experience temporary double vision dizziness (vertigo) loss of balance one sided weakness or complete paralysis of the arm leg face or one whole side of the body or be unable to speak or understand commands."

    "Question": "what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner? what are the risks if he is infected? . hello . i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear. however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms. i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him? i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about? . thank you",
    "Answer": "first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care! i recently went to my gynecologist and well i was told that i had abnormal cells on the cervix and that hpv caused it. my doctor said that everybody has hpv if you had sex at least once. that is why you need to have that pap-smear done every year to detect cancer cells which are caused by this hpv virus (in between other things). so needless to say that you cannot avoid transmitting it to him since he already has it unless he has never had sex. don't quote me. i read about it and it enforces what my doctor said according to the info i got however educated and uneducated people will have different discussions about this. the best thing is to go see your own personal doctor and ask them these questions. good luck <positive_smiley>"

    "Answer": "if your tinnitus is related to your vng test it should resolve in a few days to a week. as you may know tinnitus is common in many inner ear disorders like menieres. it could be just be a coincidence that you have tinnitus today but then again it could have some unknown association. people getting a vng certainly can having dizziness or even nausea/vomiting but tinnitus would not be a common test side-effect."

    "Question": "how can hypothyroidism be prevented?",
    "Answer": "hypothyroidism can be prevented if we know how it generated. in most cases (after a small survey done by me it is understood that) hypothyroidism begins when the thyroid gland is weakened. the thyroid gland can be weakened when a person go through deep sorrows with tears and a pain in the throat where the thyroid gland is located. and during deep sorrow thyroid gland will be forced to produce more iodine proteins etc when thyroid gland need more iodine; and that lack of iodine during long deep sorrow with tears cause sever damage to thyroid gland to be weakened. dr. william h fray ii and team found out that emotional tears contain protein-based hormones prolactin adrenocorticotropic hormone and leucine enkephalin (natural painkiller) etc. and that can be the very reason why women (more emotional being than men) are more susceptible to the hypothyroidism than men. the reason why most of the children are not affected during childhood is the thyroid gland is very strong and new and most of the time the children don't go under deep sorrow. therefore it is not hypothyroidism cause depression and sadness rather depression and deep sadness cause hypothyroidism and to be in depressed mode. therefore be happy and to be happy."

    "Question": "when should i start gaining weight during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "when it comes to pregnancy pounds timing matters. chances are weight gain during the first three months will be minimal -- and should be according to the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines. you don't need any extra calories during the first trimester; although the baby's growth is rapid he is so small that his development doesn't warrant additional energy. however you may add some pounds to your frame during the first three months because you're hungrier or because of fluid retention. some women even lose weight because they don't feel well enough to eat their usual diet. once the second trimester starts and the baby's growth begins in earnest gaining weight on a steady basis is a must. plan on putting on about a pound each week with a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and below and about a half pound a week if you had a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and above."

    "Answer": "types of prostatitis include: acute bacterial prostatitis. a sudden bacterial infection marked by inflammation of the prostate. this is the least common form of prostatitis but the symptoms are usually severe. patients with this condition have an acute urinary tract infection with increased urinary frequency and urgency need to urinate a lot at night and have pain in the pelvis and genital area. they often have fever chills nausea vomiting and burning when urinating. acute bacterial prostatitis requires prompt treatment as the condition can lead to bladder infections abscesses in the prostate or in extreme cases completely blocked urine flow. left untreated the condition can cause confusion and low blood pressure and may be fatal. the condition is usually treated in the hospital with intravenous antibiotics pain relievers and fluids. chronic bacterial prostatitis. this condition is the result of recurrent urinary tract infections that have entered the prostate gland. it is thought to exist for several years in some men before producing symptoms. the symptoms are similar to acute bacterial prostatitis but are less severe and can fluctuate in intensity. the diagnosis of this condition is often challenging. it's often difficult to find the bacteria in the urine. treatment includes antibiotics for four to 12 weeks and other treatment for pain. sometimes men are given suppressive low-dose long-duration antibiotic therapy. chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. this is the most common form of the disease accounting for 90% of the cases. the condition is marked by urinary and genital pain for at least three of the past six months. patients have no bacteria in their urine but may have other signs of inflammation. the condition can be confused with interstitial cystitis (a chronic inflammation of the bladder)."

    "Answer": "the short answer is: start the medications immediately. most people do not receive prescription medications to treat the flu because it is a virus. the usual recommendation is to rest drink plenty of fluids and take over-the-counter medications to ease symptoms (such as headache vomiting etc. ). but it's different when you have hiv or aids. when a person with hiv or aids gets a case of the flu it is a very serious matter. the treatment plan usually includes a round of antiviral drugs given for 7 days. but here's the kicker: for maximum effectiveness these drugs should be started with 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. so please begin this course of medications as soon as possible. that's not to say you should delay if you're starting the meds outside that 48-hour window. you should still begin the medications as early as possible and take the full course of antiviral drugs exactly as prescribed. please monitor your symptoms closely. if you develop a fever (assuming you don't already have one) or if you begin to feel congested in your lungs (feeling waterlogged coughing up sputum from the lungs difficulty breathing) call your doctor immediately. influenza can move quickly into pneumonia in people with a compromised immune system. best wishes to you!"

    "Answer": "hi a clear watery discharge from the vagina usually occurs when the cells of the cervix undergo certain changes known as cervical erosion. this is not a malignant or premalignant condition and usually occurs in response to estrogen or infection. since you are in permenopause the estrogen level is likely to be low. but what could be causing the discharge is a condition known as atrophic vaginitis or postmenopausal vaginitis together with cervical erosion. this condition usually occurs when the vaginal walls thin out due to low estrogen level. a reactive inflammation sets in in both the cerix and the vagina and you may get the thin clear discharge which you now have. i do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Question": "should a woman be treated for hiv during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "one of the greatest advances in the management of hiv infection has been in pregnant women. prior to antiviral therapy the risk of hiv transmission from an infected mother to her newborn was approximately 25%-35%. the first major advance in this area came with studies giving zdv after the first trimester of pregnancy then intravenously during the delivery process and then after delivery to the newborn for six weeks. this treatment showed a reduction in the risk of transmission to less than 10%. although less data are available with more potent drug combinations clinical experience suggests that the risk of transmission may be reduced to less than 5%. current recommendations are to advise hiv-infected pregnant women regarding both the unknown side effects of antiviral therapy on the fetus and the promising clinical experience with potent therapy in preventing transmission. in the final analysis however pregnant women with hiv should be treated essentially the same as nonpregnant women with hiv. exceptions would be during the first trimester where therapy remains controversial and avoiding certain drugs that may cause greater concern for fetal toxicity such as efv. all hiv-infected pregnant women should be managed by an obstetrician with experience in dealing with hiv-infected women. maximal obstetric precautions to minimize transmission of the hiv virus such as avoiding scalp monitors and minimizing labor after rupture of the uterine membranes should be observed. in addition the potential use of an elective caesarean section (c-section) should be discussed particularly in those women without good viral control of their hiv infection where the risk of transmission may be increased. breastfeeding should be avoided if alternative nutrition for the infant is available since hiv transmission can occur by this route. updated guidelines for managing hiv-infected women are updated on a regular basis and can be found at <link>."

    "Answer": "i do not recommend giving your child benadryl on top of zyrtec. they are both antihistamines and will individually have the coverage your child needs for allergy relief. however you need to partner with your pediatrician or other health-care providers to make sure this dose is safe and effective for your child. both medications are readily available over the counter but for self-use the directions on the box/bottle/package must be followed."

    "Question": "what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for migraine headaches?",
    "Answer": "your doctor will diagnose a migraine by asking you questions about your health and lifestyle and by examining you. there are no lab tests that can confirm a diagnosis. migraines can be difficult to diagnose because symptoms resemble those of other headache conditions. for example many people have been diagnosed with sinus headaches when they actually have migraines. as a result migraines are underdiagnosed and undertreated. you are likely having migraine headaches if they happen often and interfere with your daily life. your doctor may use the international headache society's criteria to diagnose migraines. you may be diagnosed if you experience 5 or more headache attacks without an aura (or 2 attacks with an aura) that last from 4 to 72 hours without treatment and are accompanied by symptoms of nausea vomiting or sensitivity to light or noise. your doctor will check your symptoms and decide whether you need to have tests to rule out other conditions that might be causing your headaches. tests may include: mri or ct scan which may be used to rule out tumors or bleeding in the brain. lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) which may be done if your doctor thinks that you might have another condition such as meningitis or bleeding in the brain. sedimentation rate (a blood test) which may help determine whether another condition is causing inflammation related to your headaches. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "i can understand your concerns. unfortunately you omitted crucial information that would help me evaluate the situation better. generally speaking we don't get too concerned about low blood pressure in people who have no symptoms. in other words if you're not fainting or experiencing an abnormal heart rhythm your low blood pressure may be nothing to be concerned about. of course if you're taking medication for high blood pressure and your pressures have dropped that low then you need to call your doctor right away. these readings could mean you need your medication dosage adjusted. but assuming you're not taking blood pressure medication you may have nothing to worry about regarding your pressure readings. very physically fit people naturally have a lower blood pressure than people who are sedentary and/or obese. are you very physically fit? if so that \"low\" blood pressure may be normal for you. dehydration can cause a person's blood pressure to drop a bit. are you drinking plenty of water throughout the day? by the way when are you taking your blood pressure readings? early-morning resting blood pressure can be quite low. your blood pressure generally comes up as you get active during the day. unless a doctor or healthcare provider told you to monitor your pressures on a regular basis you really don't need to. sometimes the information may be within normal limits yet appear alarming. if you are experiencing symptoms like fainting along with your low blood pressure then i recommend you consult a physician. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "1- start with any therapist you like. ask if they use time-limited short-term therapy or open-ended long-term. if the latter ask how long is long term. 2- work with your therapist weekly for 8-12 sessions. often patients feel they don't click have some conflict and quit therapy too soon. just like patients quit medicines too soon. a key to therapy is to discuss that you feel you are not getting along or there are conflicts in the therapy itself. sometimes it is not the content of what happened to you during the week that is important to discuss it is the process of dealing with your therapist that is actually the therapy! 3- if you are not at least partially better after about 6 months seriously ask your therapist what chance you have of responding to their therapy techniques. consider adding a med add a group therapy that uses a different style or skill consider changing therapists. 4- if you are not better at all after a year really consider a new therapist who uses a different therapy style. it doesn't mean your therapist is poor at doing therapy it means the therapy style isn't helping you. if you are gradually improving even at a slow pace stick with the therapist forever -- as long as you are improving. some therapies can take several years but expect to see gradual improvement. 5. like using antidepressants some meds don't work for some people. so we switch and add meds around. some psychotherapies do not work for some people either. know when to stay in and know when to get out. have this discussion with your therapist if you feel stuck."

    "Question": "why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?",
    "Answer": "heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output. heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water. in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid. this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath. because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. this edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. the heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. left-sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves. typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. in contrast right-sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema. persistent salt retention in these patients however may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. in patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. these patients therefore can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). the physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. these include: pitting edema of the legs and feet rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) and distended neck veins. the distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart."

    "Answer": "there's no good answer to your question because it's a bit subjective. both oral percocet (oxycodone-apap) and demerol (meperidine) are narcotic pain relievers. because each person's body responds differently to different substances one person may feel oxycodone is more effective than meperidine (or the other way around). in this case that person may describe oxycodone as \"stronger\" than meperidine. however it's not a matter really of one being stronger than the other. it's a matter of which works best to control pain in any given individual. i hope there wasn't a bet riding on this! take care!"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer first of all stop taking your xanax other than as prescribed. if you're having anxiety problems (which is what xanax is prescribed for) and the evening dose is not controlling your anxiety you should talk to your provider about better therapies for your issue. that said you may be off the hook. urine drug tests are generally given as a pass/fail type of test. these tests generally don't measure the level of a given substance in your urine. you either have xanax in your urine or you don't. since you have a valid prescription for xanax it would be presumed the drug test would detect it in your system. but again you need to stop taking xanax during the day especially if you're in a job where you operate machinery or drive trucks. you potentially jeopardize yourself and others when you take prescription medications irresponsibly. take care of yourself!"

    "Answer": "make the medical appointment to get it checked out. orchitis (an infection of the testicle) epididymitis (an infection of the epididymis) as well as other causes need to be considered. having a diagnostic exam will certainly relieve any anxiety about testicular cancer (happens at your age too)."

    "Answer": "the terrible thing is that you may or may not need any antibiotics. most viral infections are viruses and do not require antibiotics. a few are strep but making a \"self-diagnosis\" based solely on symptoms is not much better than a coin toss. some viral sore throats are mono (mononucleosis). i can't blindly diagnose you over the internet and you may or may not have the skills to accurately diagnose yourself so my recommendation is for you to be tested for strep at student health. a simple rapid test if you do have it then the amoxicillin may be appropriate (assuming you have the proper dose. you didn't share that information) for your weight and severity of infection."

    "Answer": "alcohol use among women is as infrequent as one drink per year to as much as one or more drinks every day. the latter example falls outside of the definition of moderate drinking which is defined as no more than one drink per day for women. a drink is limited to either one 12-ounce bottle of beer or wine cooler; one 5-ounce glass of wine; or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof liquor. while there have been arguments made for the benefits of moderate alcohol use for women as it relates to heart disease; the risks far outweigh the benefits and may include driving while intoxicated negative interaction with medications (even with certain herbal remedies) an increased risk for breast cancer and in pregnant women the risk for developing fetal alcohol syndrome. it is important that you know that women who continue to drink during pregnancy put their baby at risk for being born with fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) which is a pattern of physical and mental defects during fetus development during pregnancy. babies born with fas may have facial abnormalities as well as damage to the central nervous system and brain resulting in mental retardation. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Answer": "liposuction isn't weight loss surgery. it is cosmetic surgery. you do lose fat cells but the most is 6-8 pounds of fat and most doctors take out less since it is dangerous to take out more. in fact you might even retain water after the surgery which could increase weight. and if you do consume more calories then you burn you will gain weight liposuction or not. the point is this. if you do not continue with or start lifestyle changes like regular exercise and consuming the same or fewer calories than you burn then you will gain weight. liposuction simply is not a substitute for these things and doesn't magically cause weight loss. you can ask the doctor how much fat was removed and get the weight of it and if you have another procedure that would add to it but again if you're loooking for significant weight loss liposuction will not do that."

    "Answer": "most cold medications are safe to use with thyroid hormone. the only ones that i would caution you about are the decongestants like pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine. these could increase your heart rate and cause you to feel like you have too much thyroid hormone in your body. i suggest you talk to you pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter cold medicine so he/she can make certain it does not interact with your medication or your condition."

    "Question": "what specific treatments are there for hair loss in women?",
    "Answer": "female hair loss treatments include minoxidil (rogaine) hair transplants hair powder fibers like toppik wigs hair extensions and weaves. non-fda-approved and off-label use of propecia may be discussed with your doctor. minoxidil (rogaine) is available over the counter and available in 2% 4% and 5% concentrations. it may be something of a nuisance to apply twice daily but it has been shown to help conserve hair and may even grow some. minoxidil tends to grow very fine small hairs wherever it is applied. it is important to avoid running the liquid onto the face or neck where it can also grow hair. it is marketed for women at the 2% concentration but may be used in higher strengths as directed by your doctor. propecia is a drug that is currently fda approved only in men for help in hair loss. it has undergone extensive safety testing on women and it was found to be safe in postmenopausal women. it is unsafe for women of childbearing to take this drug or even handle tablets. (it is however safe for their husbands to take it while they are trying to become pregnant. ) propecia may be used as an off-label use in women who are not pregnant or planning to become pregnant while taking the medication. studies have been inconclusive with effectiveness of propecia in some women and not in others. although it is not consistently effective it may be a good option for postmenopausal women or women who are not pregnant or considering pregnancy. newer studies suggest that propecia may be somewhat helpful and worth considering in treatment of women's hair loss. surgical procedures like hair transplants can be useful for some women as well as men to \"fill in\" thinned-out areas."

    "Question": "do i have a sinus infection i have blood in my snot when i blow my nose? (mornings)slight pain in eyes certain directions. i just got over a cold but i feel fine usually only in the mornings",
    "Answer": "i've had sinus problems most of my adult life and i feel for you! first of all if you're blowing out clear junk rather than yellow or green mucus you probably don't have a sinus infection - at least not yet. the blood-tinged mucus may be due to something as simple as your surroundings simply being too dry. when that happens the tissue in your nose gets very dried out and can bleed. if you're like i used to be you blow your nose hard and you may even put mentholatum in the nostril just so you can get more comfortable. here's what i've learned finally to get past this very aggravating problem: start a nasal lavage with a netti pot or any warm saline but buffered solution (about 8 ounces) right after you get up and then again at least at night. you can find homemade recipes for your own solution but i just prefer the ease of opening a small packet of ready-mixed powder into the squeeze bottle (which i prefer over the traditional netti pot). that clears out the mucus. blow the nose (both sides) gently to get all the remaining mucus out. then i follow that with two sprays of a prescription corticosteroid spray of fluticasone. this is something that you should talk over with your doctor but i'd suggest (from personal experience) that you not use anything over the counter except a pure saline mist such as ayr or ocean. i prefer ayr because of the configuration of the bottle's tip. i use this in between nasal lavages when i'm really stuffed up. you can safely put petroleum jelly gently up into your nose. when i louse up and miss taking care of my sinuses as i'm supposed to i will get a small bleed site that scabs over etc. my doctor suggested vaseline and i have some in my bedroom and also in my office. during the dry winter months i have a cool air moisturizer going all the time in both my bedroom and in my home office. if you can find a \"hygrometer\" that lets you see the level of humidity in a room that helps a lot. i bought the kaz cool mist units. good performance and 2-year warranty plus no white stuff coming out to get all over everything. there are sometimes initial problems with impeller noise that is 'way too loud but kaz customer relations people are absolutely great at getting that problem solved over the phone in less than 5 minutes and then you have a perfectly functional humidifier. i'm sold on mine and will get more as needed. i paid only $35 at my local pharmacy for mine. hope this helps. can you tell my work load here at home is low this am? glad i had the time to forward some tips to help you out."

    "Question": "what is porphyria?",
    "Answer": "porphyrias are a family of medical conditions in which a substance called heme is not produced properly. heme consists of a compound called porphyrin joined to an iron atom and it is an essential part of hemoglobin in red blood cells. porphyrias are caused by a lack of functioning enzymes that participate in the heme-making process. the enzyme deficiency results in a buildup of the porphyrin compounds in the body which can cause tissue damage. most porphyrias are inherited. symptoms of porphyria can include: abdominal pain light sensitivity resulting in skin rashes muscle and nerve problems (pain seizures or abnormal sensations) red or brown urine porphyria is a lifelong condition. treatments vary depending on the type of porphyria and its severity. certain porphyrias can be made worse by alcohol drugs sunlight or other triggers; your doctor can advise on the best way to prevent such attacks."

    "Answer": "if you would like to impregnate your wife you may need to curtail your excessive masturbation for a few days so that your sperm count does increase and your prostate has enough time to replenish your semen volume. there are not other ways. i find it difficult to believe that you are having erectile dysfunction if you are masturbating \"many times per day\". premature ejaculation will not keep you from achieving a pregnancy as long as you are able to hold out long enough to have sexual contact with your wife. have you considered talking to a counselor about these issues? perhaps a psychologist -- one who has some experience with male sexual issues -- can really help you. hi first if you have not got over this problem yet seeing as this was now 8 months ago. does your wife know about your excess masturbating one thing you should get off your chest with your wife by telling her the facts. to start with for over masturbation you need to start an 8 week break from masturbating and any sexual contact with the wife now depending just how bad you problem is it may take another 4 to 8 weeks by doing this you will be rebooting your body and it starts self healing. if you watch porn? now is the time to get rid of it clear your computer or sites clear away any down loads and last throw away any discs get the wife to install an child porn lock she keeps the pass word. now you will know when this starts working as you will get you nocturnal erections back along with your morning woods when these start to happen its working but you need to wait still just let things get better by doing the 8 12 or 16 weeks as for your pe there is an exercise for this its called edging to find this just google pegym look under exercises and take it from there. do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "phentermine is a central nervous system appetite suppressant. it has properties similar to an amphetamine. this medication is generally prescribed for a period not to exceed 2-3 weeks to control weight gain along with diet and exercise. your yo-yo results may be a result of taking the medication over a 5 week period. you may also be experiencing a counter-intuitive side-effect of having increased hunger. at any rate the doctor who prescribed the medication should be contacted. you should not attempt to increase decrease or stop phentermine by yourself as serious side-effects symptoms may occur. here is the positive news: during the last 10 years your weight was pretty constant at 150 lbs. to 155 lbs. based upon having a medium built along with your sex height and age the range of ideal weight for you should be 126lbs. to 154 lbs. the suggested mean weight for you is 140 lbs. that tells me that you were doing well with your weight prior to becoming injured. here are my suggestions: talk with your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program. in order to maintain your current weight of 170 lbs. your average calorie intake is about 2300 per day. i recommend that you cut back on your daily calorie intake by 500 calories. taking in 1800 calories per day will result in 1 pound per week weight loss. the 1800 calories should be divided as follows: protein- 15% or 270 calories carbohydrates- 55% or 991 calories and fats- 30% or 539 calories. losing 1 pound per week is safe and will result in a 20 pound weight loss within 5 months. by combining some moderate exercise with your diet you’ll be back to your more typical weight of 150 pounds before you know it. you may lose weight quicker by reducing your calories to 1400 calories per day and by increasing your exercise routine. to be safe and effective i recommend not skipping meals or reducing your daily calories below 1300. the internet is loaded with 1800 daily calorie menus that are nutritious filling include snacks and contain varied and delicious foods. some of these menus even come with a weekly shopping list of necessary food and ingredients along with recipes for the main courses. dieting can be more fulfilling when shared with another person. see if a friend or family member will join you in your weight loss program. reward yourself for weight losses by having your hair or nails done."

    "Answer": "let me set your mind at ease: your penis size sounds pretty normal. of course it depends on how you measured. this webmd article \" is my penis too small? \" explains exactly how to measure your penis and gives some statistics about average penis size. most men do not measure their penis length correctly so you may be in for a pleasant surprise if you re-measure after reading this article. even if your penis size comes up short let me assure you that while many men care a lot about penis size many women don't care about it at all. for women the loving intimate relationship she has with a man is far more important than the size of his sexual organ. take care! i tried all penis enlargement product. pills not working. only natural penis enlargement exercise working. i tryed it. i enlargement 1. 5 inch about in 4 month. <link> i would say normally it should be in between 3 to 8 inchs i tried all penis enlargement product. pills not working. only natural penis enlargement exercise working. i tryed it. i enlargement 1. 5 inch about in 4 month. look from here dude. you seem to be a rather small man which is ok. 4. 4 inches is ok for your size body. there is a possibility that you might grow another half inch. i believe that dicks can continue to grow until approximately age 25. unless you gain in muscle do not add body fat. as we age we tend to have a slower metabolism and the same amount of food we used to eat will no longer be burnt up by our physical activity. for each 20-30 pounds we gain we basically \"lose\" a half inch or so. you didn't say if you were gay straight or bisexual. learn how to use it and your smaller size won't matter as much. the average dick length for american males is 5. 0 inches so yours is not really that much smaller. i hope this helps you. roberto in texas."

    "Question": "does the use of insulin affect your eyes?",
    "Answer": "insulin affects your vision because insulin lowers blood glucose levels which in turn effects the lens of the eye not because insulin has a direct effect on your eyes. when your blood glucose (sugar) levels go up fluid enters the lens of your eyes and when your blood glucose goes down the fluid shifts out of your lens. these changes in fluid in the lens cause blurred vision so both high and low blood glucose levels affect your vision. as your blood glucose levels stabilize on insulin these shifts become less and your vision improves. so be patient. in most cases the blurry vision after you start insulin settles down. usually these vision changes resolve within a few days or weeks depending on how quickly your diabetes comes under control. after examining your eyes your doctor will be in good position to hopefully reassure you that these vision changes are temporary. therefore unless you are really having serious vision problems wait until your blood glucose levels settle before having your vision tested for a new pair of glasses."

    "Answer": "body dysmorphic disorder is a very recognized condition where the patient’s mind doesn’t really reflect what their appearance is. they always thing that they are not as good looking not as young they are unhappy with their appearance and despite having often very nice and appropriate procedures they want more they want something different. well frankly in our training for example we were trained by psychiatrists in interviewing you know how to interview how to ask the question how to get to it. now sometimes it’s not very hard because you know they come to us and they are 38 years old and they’ve had 3 face lifts already. but sometimes you’ve got to do a little more work. but generally you kind of get at the issues because you look at them and you listen and you get a sense and it just doesn’t seem right. in other words the patient’s worries seem disproportional to how good they look to you. that’s how you sort it out and the sorting is important because that patient generally presents i think a much bigger challenge than one might want to take on because they often are not satisfied regardless of the high quality of the work delivered. that’s one condition that has to be sorted out. the other condition is someone who doesn’t necessarily have the wrong view of their appearance they just feel like they have to be up to the minute and every year they just have to have something done to keep up with the joneses almost. it’s like a badge of honor or courage oh yes i just had a face lift this year. but the problem with that is with each successive operation becomes more difficult more fraught with hazard and runs the risk of going over the edge of looking natural. we had a very high profile patient come in here who i’ve known for 25 years. although i’ve not operated on her she was operated on by one of my teachers and when i first met her and she came in and asked me about having the chemical peel the chemical wrinkle removal process. well i know that my teacher did that procedure on her many many years ago and again it’s a long lasting procedure. she certainly did not need it so i advised against it and respectfully declined to take on the case. well i saw her later and somehow she had something else done and i have to say it wasn’t very good. she looked wrong she looked pulled she looked strapped to the 747 look. and that you can’t disengage that i mean that it’s permanent you can’t reverse it. so sometimes peculiar to our community here particularly the hollywood environment there’s a little greater tendency towards that. people are struggling very hard to hold on to that youthful appearance. but as you know from some of the very high profile celebrities who have had too much nose job work done etcetera etcetera you can pass the point of no return and that’s not very good. bad decision bad decision by the patient and by the way bad decision by the doctor. i can tell you in our practice here 20% of the people that come in are told either that it’s not appropriate to do or what they have is so unusual complex or whatever that they would best be served at least by a consultation with another specialist. for example someone who has had two or three eyelid operations and they’ve had some problems with it i’m not sure they should have another one. but i will defer to my colleague in the ophthalmic plastic surgery world to help make that decision. there is always the risk of taking an imperfection and making it worse and that is never a happy scene. no surgeon wants to preside over either a complication or a failure. you want the right operation for the right patient and that gives you a happy patient and that’s what drives us in this work. it’s about making people happy and having a waiting room of people on the post-operative visit days who are all sitting there saying wow this is really great i’m glad i did this."

    "Answer": "sexual dysfunction in both men and women can occur with type 1 diabetes. in women: uncontrolled sugar levels in the body can cause reduced blood flow to the reproductive organs hormonal imbalances and nerve impairment. more frequent bouts of yeast infections have also been associated with type 1 diabetes in women. in men: uncontrolled hyperglycemia can cause problems with blood vessels and in maintaining an erection. blood vessels may become firm and prevent sufficient blood flow for a man to either obtain or to maintain an erection. nerve damage may also cause a medical condition called retrograde ejaculation. with retrograde ejaculation the male's normal expostulate in forwarded to the urinary bladder and the semen is passed-off with the urine. i suggest that you and your husband start out with a visit to the family doctor. blood studies can be completed and your husband’s current diabetic condition may be assessed. at the same time you may have a frank discussion concerning the desire to have another child. the primary care doctor is also in a position to refer you to physicians that specialize in helping couples to conceive. with today's medical science you and your husband stand a great chance of having another child."

    "Question": "how should i take a temperature for fever?",
    "Answer": "digital thermometers can be used to measure rectal oral or axillary (under the armpit) temperatures. the american academy of pediatrics does not recommend use of mercury thermometers (glass) and they encourage parents to remove mercury thermometers from their households to prevent accidental exposure to this toxin. measuring an axillary (under the armpit) temperature for fever: axillary temperatures are not as accurate as rectal or oral measurements and these generally measure 1 degree lower than a simultaneously obtained oral temperature. place the tip of the digital thermometer in your child's armpit. leave in place about one minute or until you hear a beep to check a digital reading. measuring fever by eardrum temperature: tympanic (ear) thermometers must be placed correctly in your child's ear to be accurate. too much earwax can cause the reading to be incorrect. eardrum temperature measurements are not accurate in small children and should not be used in children under 3 years (36 months) of age. this is especially true in infants below 3 months of age when obtaining an accurate temperature is very important. measuring fever by oral temperature: people 4 years old and older can have their temperature taken with a digital thermometer under the tongue with their mouth closed. clean the thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol and rinse. turn the thermometer on and place the tip of the thermometer as far back under the tongue as possible. the mouth should remain closed as an open mouth can cause readings to be inaccurate. the thermometer should remain in place for about one minute or until you hear the beep. check the digital reading. avoid hot or cold drinks within 15 minutes of oral temperature measurement to ensure correct readings. measuring fever by rectal temperature: the american academy of pediatrics recommends rectal temperature measurements for children under 3 years of age as this gives the most accurate reading of core temperature. clean the thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol and rinse with cool water. use a small amount of lubricant such as petroleum jelly on the end. place the child prone (belly-side down) on a firm surface or place your child face up and bend his legs to his chest. after separating the buttocks insert the thermometer approximately ½ to 1 inch into the rectum. do not insert it too far. hold the thermometer in place loosely keeping your hand cupped around your child's bottom and keep your fingers on the thermometer to avoid it accidently sliding further into the rectum. keep it there for about one minute until you hear the beep. remove the thermometer and check the digital reading. label the rectal thermometer so it's not accidentally used in the mouth. a rectal temperature will read approximately 1 degree higher than a simultaneously obtained oral temperature."

    "Answer": "oh one more thing. gonorrhea and chlamydia is unlikely to go away without treatment. not likely. gonorrhea is painful a man with lots of penile discharge and pain on urination. i don't think he could have tolerated it for six days let alone six years. chlamydia is not as painful but again it is very unlikely that he has had untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia for six years. my guess is that he has sexually contracted it recently even if he denies it. he may not want to truthfully disclose this information. gonorrhea is less like to go away without treatment. it is better to visit venereal disease expert and get treated. if left untreated recurrence of symptoms is very common."

    "Answer": "well the obvious answer is: stop doing sit-ups. but seriously it sounds like you may be overdoing the sit-ups or performing them incorrectly. doing sit-ups should not cause the skin to rub off your tailbone. traditional sit-ups aren't really a recommended form of exercise anymore as they may cause lower back issues. abdominal crunches are the preferred exercise and they shouldn't rub your tailbone raw because your skin shouldn't be moving in the tailbone area. at the very least take care to perform your sit-ups on some type of padding. and don't do any sit-ups until your wounds heal. skin wounds can become infected fairly easily and you want to avoid that. you may want to visit webmd's fitness & exercise community to discuss your exercise regimen with other people and experts. they might be able to help you figure out why you're having this annoying problem with sit-ups. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "allegra-d is in the same drug class as zyrtec-d claritin-d and all its generics. all three of these medications used to be prescription strength. a few years ago claritin and all its products converted to over-the-counter status which led other medications in its class to make the switch from prescription to over the counter as well. allegra and it products have not made that switch yet. it is worth the cost savings to see if another one of the antihistamines found over the counter work as comparable to your usual allegra-d. monitor your symptoms to make sure they do not worsen. both claritin and zyrtec products work relatively quickly. so you would see relief taking place on the same day you take the medication. if your symptoms do worsen then switch to another antihistamine or pick up your prescription for allegra-d."

    "Answer": "well thermage is indeed an fda approved procedure that super heats the skin and specifically the collagen which is one of the main building blocks of skin and theoretically would form new younger and tighter collagen. now that process doesn’t take place over night. and so the manufacturer has advised physicians and secondarily patients that they will not see an immediate result. the hoped for result may take 4 or 5 or 6 months to achieve. that process is probably not achieved the success that we had hoped it might. again by observation because the patients have to accept that when they are employing a new technology. we are all learning about it so the first kid on the block may be satisfied and may be disappointed. i think to this point we’re a little bit disappointed. now that said there haven’t been any complications. i think most patients consider the significant complication to have hit their wallet because they didn’t get much for their money. and it’s not inexpensive. it can be several thousand dollars because it means a visit in the operating room the doctor’s time the technical the cost of the technology. so again not harmful but not really delivering the goods. certainly not a substitute for a surgical facelift. and many services technologies kind of position themselves as less invasive less traumatic less expensive less everything quote facelift but the answer is they can’t match the proven record of a surgical procedure. it’s just not possible by having the skin treated by a beam of light to get rid of a saggy chin and jowls and the product of many years of ages and perhaps even some dissipation."

    "Question": "can a female bladder infection cause an oral infection to a man who performed oral sex on me",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer it's not likely no. urinary tract infections (\"bladder infection\") in women is usually caused when germs from fecal material (\"poop\") get into the urinary tract. these germs upset the normal balance of bacteria within the urinary system and cause an infection. a urinary tract infection is treated with antibiotics. this type of infection is generally not transmissible. in other words you can't really give a uti to another person and this includes giving them an infection in the mouth. it is possible for a man to get an infection in his mouth if he performs oral sex on someone who has a sexually transmitted infection (sti or std) like herpes or possibly genital warts. if your partner has any type of mouth infection you should not receive oral sex from him until he determines what the infection is and gets it treated. his primary care provider can evaluate the mouth problem diagnose it and start appropriate treatment. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "contaminated wounds are the sites where tetanus bacteria multiply. deep wounds or those with dead tissue are particularly prone to tetanus infection. puncture wounds such as those caused by nails splinters or insect bites are favorite locations of entry for the bacteria. the bacteria can also be introduced through burns any break in the skin and drug injection sites. tetanus can also be a hazard to both the mother and newborn child (by means of the uterus after delivery and through the umbilical cord stump). the potent toxin that is produced when the tetanus bacteria multiply is the major cause of harm in this disease."

    "Answer": "have you had your blood sugar tested lately? you describe some of the classic symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. this condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin. this over-reaction by the body leaves too little glucose (sugar) available to your cells for processing. symptoms of hypoglycemia can include: nausea/vomiting sweating dizziness/lightheadedness fainting shakiness heart palpitations blurred or double vision i suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms. your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you don't have diabetes. meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve. it sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body -- not a lot though. too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again! wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "before blindly starting in home remedies it would be good to have your elderly mother properly examined. finding a reason for his bloody ear discharge. this could easily be an infection that requires a prescription antibiotic or just a scratch in the ear canal. without an exam it would be difficult to know how to effectively treat it. the oozing from the navel is likely a skin infection perhaps impetigo (a staph or strep infections). again because of her age this may need more aggressive treatment than what you can provide at home. you can carefully clean this area with betadine and use a topical antibiotic ointment for now. it may or may not help. sometimes an elderly person will get fungal infections in both these areas so an antibiotic would not help. if this is the case anti-fungal treatments are required. again getting a proper diagnosis first would be best."

    "Answer": "unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care."

    "Answer": "when she looks into the mirror a lady decides whether she’s happy or unhappy with the state of her skin and when she sees the vertical lips lines and maybe the deep lines around the crow’s foot area and some frown lines here and some forehead lines at some point she’s going to ask herself well should i do something about it? now she could use an entry level procedure like botox that will help the squint lines it’s very good for the vertical frown lines but it doesn’t change the overall characteristics of the skin when there has been a lot of sun damage that brown color the kind of an unhealthy look sun damage brown spots age spots whatever you want to call them. it would take a resurfacing the removal of that damaged layer of skin and forcing nature to regenerate fresh new skin and that’s really what the chemical peel or the laser peel does. so some patients may need a little help with restylane a little help with botox a lot of help with the chemical or laser treatment. when you look in the mirror you decide what you don’t like and then you have to consult with a specialist who will tell you what the remedies are. and for some people treatment a isn’t proper and for others it is and that’s the value of the consultation. only if it’s really bothering you a lot. i mean everybody everybody has kind of a tipping point. there’s a point where one day you look in the mirror and you say you know what i know it’s not going to get any better i think i need to talk to a doctor about this. and that age could be 40 it could be 65. and people have come in here to consult for the first time with a cosmetic surgeon at 75 or 80. my first question is where have you been? no but whatever is right for the patient is what counts. it’s all in the eyes of the beholder. if you see you’re starting to wrinkle should you rush in in your 40s and 50s? we’re here to serve when appropriate at any age. now does the chemical peel do any kind of lifting? . in fact it doesn’t correct the jowls or the sagging neck but a lift in the sense that it does tighten the skin on the face. it’ll make this groove a little better. not enough perhaps to solve the problem completely but what it does is it gives you a youthful looking skin because it’s not wrinkled it doesn’t have the age spots doesn’t have the brown spots doesn’t look like you’ve baked in the sun and that’s something that no other process obtains."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. few things are as painful as leg cramps! two common causes of lower leg cramps are dehydration and low potassium levels in the blood. so your first potential solution is to simply drink more water. if you have high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you substantially increase your water intake but in general drinking a few extra glasses of water a day isn't going to hurt you. if you have high blood pressure and take a \"water pill\" (diuretic) you should find out if it is a \"potassium-sparing\" type of not. if your diuretic is not potassium-sparing you should be taking a prescription potassium pill. again if you're uncertain about these things you should consult your doctor. i don't recommend people run out and start taking potassium supplements which you can buy over the counter to cure leg cramps. potassium is a key mineral for heart function and overdosing on potassium can cause serious heart rhythm abnormalities. however eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauce and whole beans (like navy beans or pinto beans) not only will increase your serum (blood) potassium levels to possibly help the leg cramps but they will be diet-friendly for your diabetes. everything i've told you here is based on the assumption you don't have a lot of other health issues (besides the diabetes) going on and that you don't take a lot of medications. many medications and co-existing medical conditions can cause lower leg cramps. so it's always a good idea to let your medical professional know what's going on. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you feel you're being ignored by the medical professionals who are treating you. that's not good. sometimes a person has to be very vocal in telling their health care provider what they want done -- and why. if you feel your complaints of chronic back pain have been ignored perhaps this would be a good time for you to tell your doctor straight out that you want some testing done on your back to figure out what is causing the pain. it can be helpful to take a trusted family member or friend with you on these appointments. this person can act as an \"advocate \" or a person who will take up your cause with you. your advocate should have a pen and some paper to take notes and he or she should feel free to ask questions. i hope this approach will get you the results you want!"

    "Answer": "the vitamin d issue is rather complex. large observational studies indicate that folks with low vitamin d levels are at greater risk for type 2 diabetes osteoporosis and a whole host of medical problems. it is very difficult to know whether this is due to a true cause and effect relationship (low vitamin d helping to cause type 2 diabetes) or whether this association is due to confounding factors such that low vitamin d levels are just an indicator of poor health status or suboptimal lifestyle habits. . so far i have not been recommending vitamin d for people who have normal levels and i have supported supplementation or sunshine for people with low levels."

    "Question": "can sleep deprivation cause aggressive behavior in children?",
    "Answer": "it’s becoming more widely known that sleep disordered breathing leads to poor behavior in children. estimates show that as many of 25% of children diagnosed with add or adhd may actually have an underlying sleep problem that can be treated – resulting in better behavior and improved learning skills. most often a sleep problem is identified in children and then health providers researchers and parents look for behavior issues. a new study at the university of michigan approached children behavior and their sleep with a new twist: the study first looked for children with certain behaviors and then looked at the sleep patterns of those children. the cross sectional survey at the university of michigan showed some very intriguing results: kids who show aggressive behavior in school are twice as likely to have symptoms of sleep disordered breathing as children that do not exhibit aggressive behaviors. of the 341 students surveyed by the researchers about 32% were assessed by their parent or teacher as having a conduct problem via a standardized behavior questionnaire. parents of these children also completed a standardized pediatric sleep questionnaire and scores for identification of symptoms for sleep disordered breathing (snoring stopping breathing daytime sleepiness etc. ) were collected. so aggressive kids appear to be sleepy kids and it is not always because they are snoring (which might make you think they are not getting good quality sleep). what could be the culprits? not getting kids to bed on time kids rooms not being conducive to sleep formal sleep disorders"

    "Answer": "the only way to loose weight is to burn more calories than you take in. that's fine. the problem here is that this person is eating so few calories that their body is activating its starvation mechanism cauing muscles to be catabolized as well as drastic decreases in overall metabolic rate. if he/she wants to loose weight they should eat on average 500-1000 calories a day less than their adjusted basal metabolic rate depending on how much weight loss is required (you can calculate this number here: <link> that is to say the less weight you have to loose the less of a deficit is required. this deficit causes your body to pull from its fat reserves without unreasonably increasing the rate of muscle atrophy. having said the american college of sports medicine recommends that calorie intake never fall below 1200 calories a day for women or 1800 calories a day for men."

    "Answer": "well there's really no good answer to your question. it's not really possible to study fetuses in terms of their emotions or awareness. it has long been known that a fetus will withdraw from painful stimuli (for example if you touch a fetus with a needle it may flinch) but whether that is simply a motor reflex or is a sign of greater cognition is not known. unfortunately we can't exactly climb into the womb and ask the fetus how it's feeling. certain faiths have particular beliefs about the time at which an embryo or fetus is endowed with a \"soul. \" some faiths believe this happens at conception. other faiths believe this happens at birth. you'll find a wide range of philosophies on this topic. in terms of the science we just don't know. i wish i could cite some studies for you but there aren't any that i know of. wishing you all the best!"

    "Answer": "a baker's cyst can indeed be removed by surgery. in fact that's a typical \"last resort\" step after drainage and steroids haven't solved the problem. a baker's cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind the knee joint. that's why all of your pain is behind your knee rather than in your joint proper. as to why your physician is recommending a knee replacement that's a good question. i'd ask him or her. sometimes an underlying condition like arthritis can cause a baker's cyst to develop. if that's the case in your situation it could be one reason why your doctor would mention a knee replacement as opposed to simply removing the cyst. i'm only mentioning this for informational purposes not in an attempt to read your doctor's mind. i'd suggest you go back to your doctor and find out why he or she is recommending a knee replacement. you may want to consult a surgeon as well to get his or her opinion about what the best treatment option is for you. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what causes cataracts?",
    "Answer": "the lens lies behind the iris and the pupil. it works much like a camera lens. it focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye where an image is recorded. the lens also adjusts the eye's focus letting us see things clearly both up close and far away. the lens is made of mostly water and protein. the protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. but as we age some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. this is a cataract. over time the cataract may grow larger and cloud more of the lens making it harder to see. researchers suspect that there are several causes of cataracts such as smoking and diabetes. or it may be that the protein in the lens just changes from the wear and tear it takes over the years. the term \"age-related\" is a little misleading. you don't have to be a senior citizen to get this type of cataract. in fact people can have an age-related cataract in their 40s and 50s. but during middle age most cataracts are small and do not affect vision. it is after age 60 that most cataracts steal vision. who is at risk for cataracts? the risk of cataract increases as you get older. other risk factors for cataracts include: certain diseases such as diabetes. personal behavior such as smoking and alcohol use. the environment such as prolonged exposure to sunlight. wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts. if you smoke stop. researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataracts. they recommend eating green leafy vegetables fruit and other foods with antioxidants. if you are age 60 or older you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. in addition to cataracts your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and other vision disorders. early treatment for many eye diseases may save your sight."

    "Question": "how are gallstones treated?",
    "Answer": "there are a number of ways to treat gallstones though most gallstones are silent. if silent gallstones are discovered in someone age 65 or older the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only 20%(or less assuming a life span of 75 years. in this instance it is reasonable not to treat the individual. among younger people no treatment also might be appropriate if they have serious lifethreatening diseases -- for example serious heart disease -- that are likely to shorten their life span. on the other hand in healthy young people treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime is higher. once symptoms begin treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. cholecystectomy cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures of the abdominal wall. laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. there also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. digestion is not affected and no change in diet is necessary. chronic diarrhea occurs in approximately 10% of patients. sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. in such situations there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well and cholecystectomy is necessary. it may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery but this may not always be possible. another way to remove gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone. sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. the cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ercp. after the sphincter is cut instruments may be passed through the endoscope and up into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. it also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include the general anesthesia perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum bleeding and pancreatitis. oral dissolution therapy it is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. the medication is a naturally-occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol (actigall urso). bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. the bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones. there are important limitations to the use of ursodiol: it is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. it works only for small gallstones less than 1 centimeter-1. 5 centimeter in diameter. it takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment. due to these limitations ursodiol generally is used only in people with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very high cholesterol content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. it also is reasonable to use ursodiol in people whose gallstones were likely to have formed because of a transient event for example rapid loss of weight since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (eswl) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones particularly those lodged in bile ducts. eswl generators produces shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. the shock waves shatter the gallstone and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically as in sphincterotomy."

    "Question": "what is the treatment for menstrual migraine?",
    "Answer": "there are several aspects to treating menstrual migraines: to treat menstrual migraine take medications after the onset. generally medications that are effective in stopping nonmenstrual migraines are effective at also treating menstrual migraines. to prevent menstrual migraine take medications just before the onset of menstruation and continue for the duration of the expected headache. taking hormones such as estrogens or estrogen-related medications also help to prevent migraine. to reduce the frequency and duration of menstrual migraine take prophylactic medications (such as beta-blockers calcium channel blockers anticonvulsants tricyclic antidepressants) that are normally used on a continuous basis to prevent nonmenstrual migraines. nsaids such as naproxen sodium (aleve) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) have been used effectively to treat menstrual migraines. a combination analgesic containing acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine (acc) can also be used to treat menstrual migraines. for women whose menstruation and menstrual migraines occur on a regular and predictable pattern nsaids may be used 24 hours before the expected onset of menstrual migraine and continued for the expected duration of the headache. since nsaids inhibit prostaglandins they have the added benefit of relieving menstrual cramps as well. triptans (naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zolmitriptan) have been found to be effective in treating menstrual migraines as well as controlling the associated nausea and vomiting. sumatriptan given two to three days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of menstrual migraine. naratriptan used in the same manner has also been found to be effective in preventing menstrual migraine. however in those cases where breakthrough headaches occurred they were just as severe as in patients taking placebo. dihydroergotamine (dhe) can be used as a nasal spray or given intramuscularly or intravenously to stop menstrual migraines. ergotamine (oral rectal or intranasal) and dhe (intranasal intramuscular or intravenous) can be used around the time of menstruation (several days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache) to prevent menstrual migraines. if these medications are ineffective doctors may try daily preventive medications such as beta-blockers anticonvulsants calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants to reduce the frequency and the severity of menstrual migraines. the choice of the preventive medications is based on the experiences and preferences of the doctor the medication side effects and the woman's other associated medical conditions. for women already taking preventive medications who still experience headaches the doses of preventive medications can be increased around the time of menstruation. (some doctors use preventive medications only around the time of menstruation. ) alternatively doctors may try hormone treatment. since a drop in estrogen level just prior to menstruation is the trigger for menstrual migraines estrogen replacement before menstruation has been used in preventing menstrual migraines. for some women with menstrual migraine estradiol skin patches (such as tts 50 tts 100) applied two days before menstrual migraine and continued for seven days during the expected headache period is effective. however the dose of estrogen must be closely monitored as too high of a dose can actually trigger migraine in susceptible individuals. some women with difficult-to-treat menstrual migraines may be helped by using low-dose oral contraceptives to reduce the estrogen fluctuations. other less frequently used medications for menstrual migraines include tamoxifen bromocriptine danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh)."

    "Question": "left lymph node under jaw has hurt for past couple weeks. for the past couple weeks the lymph node under my jaw to the left side has been hurting. my grandmother told me to gargle salt water and i also went to the doctor and he said it should be fine. but i don't understand why the pain has lasted so long. should i go back and try to get some tests done?",
    "Answer": "maybe. lymph nodes enlarge or become tender in response to an infection or inflammation in their immediate drainage neighborhood. since your doctor was not able to find a source for this pain or inflammation it would not be inappropriate to have some basic tests first (like a cbc - complete blood count). many things including dental disorders can cause an enlarged lymph node so consider a visit to your dentist as well."

    "Answer": "you don't have to be asking any questions; let her medical provider do that for you during an examination. finding a specific cause of severe pain is more than just asking questions. it is analyzing the answers and correlating those answers with physical examination findings lab tests and imaging studies. you did not provide any information about the type of pain location etc. that your daughter was experiencing so it is important that she see a medical professional."

    "Question": "does a crowned tooth require any special care?",
    "Answer": "while a crowned tooth does not require any special care remember that simply because a tooth is crowned does not mean the underlying tooth is protected from decay or gum disease. therefore continue to follow good oral hygiene practices including brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing once a day-especially around the crown area where the gum meets the tooth. antibacterial mouth rinse can also help."

    "Question": "how can i reduce the risk of contracting shingles when i am pregnant?",
    "Answer": "the varicella-zoster virus is highly contagious. if you have not had chickenpox it's important that you avoid exposure to anyone known to have the infection -- or even crowds where you may come in contact with the infection particularly if you are pregnant. if you already had chickenpox you cannot catch shingles from someone with chickenpox or shingles. having chickenpox during pregnancy could potentially lead to chickenpox infection or birth defects in your unborn child depending on when you are infected. shingles too could potentially cause problems for your baby but most experts agree the risk is less than with chickenpox. in one large study there was no evidence of fetal harm in women who developed shingles. if you're not sure if you have had chickenpox your doctor can perform a blood test to check for antibodies to vzv. if you have the antibodies (indicating you have already had chickenpox infection) you run the risk of shingles in the future but you cannot catch shingles from someone else. there is also a vaccine called zostavax that can help prevent shingles. in clinical studies the vaccine reduced the overall occurrence of shingles by half. for people who were vaccinated and got shingles anyway the severity was dramatically reduced. but the time to get the vaccine is before you get pregnant. the vaccine's manufacturer recommends waiting at least three months after getting the vaccine before attempting to become pregnant."

    "Question": "how much protein and how much fat is a woman supposed to consume every day?",
    "Answer": "the exact amount of protein and fat you need depends on the number of calories you need each day which in turn is based on factors such as your height and activity level. protein should make up about 10% to 35% of your total calories a day. so in general women need about 50 grams of protein each day. that’s honestly not hard to get especially if you eat meat. protein is good for satisfying hunger so it’s safe to include a little more if that helps. a 3-ounce piece of meat has 21 grams of protein. even a cup of beans has 16 grams. and a cup of yogurt has 11 grams. fat should make up 20% to 35% of your total calories. so if you’re eating 1500 calories per day you want to eat less than about 60 grams of fat. and of course make sure it's the good fat sources that you're eating like nuts avocados and olive oil. food labels are a good way to see how many grams of protein and fat are in your food. but keep in mind the 2000-calorie diet that’s often referred to on food labels is too much for most women unless you’re very physically active."

    "Question": "does it take boiling water to extract antioxidants from green tea? do i need to worry about antioxidants?",
    "Answer": "there are countless components in tea that have helpful action in the body (including some acting as antioxidants). the water needs to be hot enough to leach the components from the tea leaves into the water. not necessarily boiling water is needed. something to keep in mind is that the phytochemicals in tea have a half-life of about 4 hours which means they start to break down substantially after that. so. it makes sense to drink some tea in the morning and some in the afternoon and evening to keep a wonderful level of antioxidant phytochemicals in your bloodstream throughout the day. i don't know what you mean about antioxidants in the diet being something to worry about. generally getting antioxidants from foods vs. supplements keep the amounts sensible and health-promoting and in a balance with other nutrients also found in those foods many of which have synergy together."

    "Question": "a free blood screening = bun of 21; my creatinine serum was 0. 93; and my bun/creatinine ratio was 23. do i call dr.?",
    "Answer": "well let's start at the beginning. i'll include some links to more information. the bun (blood urea nitrogen) test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working. a \"normal\" bun range for adults is around 6-20 mg/dl. the fact your bun is 21 isn't necessarily reason for concern. many factors (including various medications) can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you. it's hard to say without some past lab results to compare with. serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0. 6-1. 2 mg/dl and for women the range is around 0. 4-1. 0. so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits. a normal bun:creatinine ratio is considered to be 10:1-20:1. your bun/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm. however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results. what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. that's why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year. by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment. since i have no background information on you specifically it's impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation. if you're at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider. best wishes to you! no"

    "Question": "hi i just turned 12 and my penis is 4. 6 inches long is this normal and why does it grow so quick",
    "Answer": "it's probably time to say \"welcome to puberty! \" it sounds like everything is normal to me. when you enter puberty a cascade of hormones begins flooding through your body. these hormones cause you to develop body hair and they also will cause your penis to become larger. the testicles also increase in size. and yes sometimes these things happen with startling quickness. that seems to be the case with you. please don't get into a habit of measuring your penis. every guy on the planet gets worried about his penis size: is it too small? let me tell you there is a wide range of \"normal\" penis sizes. yours sounds within the normal range and it's probably not done developing yet. another thing: eventually years from now you'll be ready to use that penis to have sex. please remember to always practice safe sex. use a condom even if the girl you're with tells you she's on birth control. condoms protect you (and your partner) from a wide variety of sexually transmitted diseases. at 12 years old you're nowhere near ready for sex. but a little information now may help you later right? if you can't talk to your parents about puberty sex and all the physical and emotional changes you're going through try to find a trusted adult (maybe a friend's dad athletic coach pastor or school counselor) to confide in. it's good to talk to someone who can tell you \"everything's going to be ok. \" wishing you well! hi you have a gift look after it as you get older women will just love you. its ok you can put yourself above normal. don't worry your ok. good luck ps just look after it wash it daily and don't forget behind your foreskin its very important that you keep your penis healthy. don't over masturbate if you masturbate use a featherlight touch. just remember your penis is affected by every aspect of your physical mental and emotional life. keep a copy of this last bit it will stand you well. do hope this bit helps you. you are in the midst of puberty so your body will go through some pretty drastic changes. but do not worry. these are all normal. and the average penis size is 6 inches erect so you are well on your way. but down the road a bit you might want to consider using a penis health creme every morning. these help men keep their penis skin healthy clean smooth and irritation-free. this is a big part of sex and intimacy. it's not just about size. i use a creme called man1 man oil and it works great. keep it in mind. good luck to you!"

    "Answer": "hyperthyroidism can be suspected in patients with: tremors. excessive sweating. smooth velvety skin. fine hair. a rapid heart rate. an enlarged thyroid gland. there may be puffiness around the eyes and a characteristic stare because of the elevation of the upper eyelids. advanced symptoms are easily detected but early symptoms especially in the elderly may be quite inconspicuous. in all cases a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and usually are elevated with hyperthyroidism. however the main tool for detection of hyperthyroidism is measurement of the blood thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) level. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if an excess amount of thyroid hormone is present tsh is \"down-regulated\" and the level of tsh falls in an attempt to reduce production of thyroid hormone. thus the measurement of tsh should result in low or undetectable levels in cases of hyperthyroidism. however there is one exception. if the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is due to a tsh-secreting pituitary tumor then the levels of tsh will be abnormally high. this uncommon disease is known as \"secondary hyperthyroidism. \" although the blood tests mentioned previously can confirm the presence of excessive thyroid hormone they do not point to a specific cause. if there is obvious involvement of the eyes a diagnosis of graves' disease is almost certain. a combination of antibody screening (for graves' disease) and a thyroid scan using radioactively labelled iodine (which concentrates in the thyroid gland) can help diagnose the underlying thyroid disease. these studies are chosen on a case-by-case basis."

    "Answer": "herpes simplex virus 2 (hsv2) igm refers to current infection or outbreak. so this would be postive if you recently have had or currently have a herpetic outbreak. whereas hsv2 igg refers to a previous infection which means that you have been infected with the herpes virus and are therefore able to transmit the virus to someone else. once you have the virus like all viruses you will have it forever. essentially a positive igg and negative igm means you have the virus but not a current or recent outbreak. if you have frequent outbreaks or if your partner tests negative for herpes it is very important that you start suppresive antiviral therapy to prevent outbreaks and to decrease the risk of transmitting the virus. realize that even if you are on suppresive medication you can still pass the virus on to your partner so using a condom is also very important."

    "Answer": "according to the american heart association a total cholesterol over 240 doubles your risk of heart disease compared to someone with a total cholesterol of 200. what adds to your risk is your high triglycerides combined with a high ldl (bad cholesterol). your hdl doesn't put you at increased risk but having a high hdl (60 or higher) is protective against heart disease. so yes you should take these numbers seriously. the good news is there's much you can do to improve your numbers including eating a healthy diet exercising and watching added sugars and alcohol consumption. for cholesterol basics see this article and for more on what those numbers mean see this one. take care of yourself!"

    "Answer": "you cannot be denied care simply because you have a policy offered under the aca. not all physicians and hospitals participate in every plan offered through a state marketplace however. if you go to a physician or hospital that is not in your plan’s network you will have to pay out-of-network rates. depending on what type of out-of-network benefits your plan offers you may have to pay the full cost."

    "Question": "what happens if you a fever during concussion?",
    "Answer": "if you've been medically diagnosed (not self-diagnosed) with a concussion and you develop a fever within the next several days you should again seek medical attention. the two things (the fever and the concussion) could be unrelated but a new symptom accompanying a diagnosis like concussion deserves to be evaluated by a qualified medical provider. if you are self-diagnosing a concussion you should seek medical attention because you may have mis-diagnosed yourself. anyone who believes he or she has suffered a concussion should receive appropriate medical care because there are different degrees of concussion ranging from mild to serious. different degrees of concussion require different types of care. most concussions are not considered a medical emergency and do not require a trip to the emergency room. if you lost consciousness or begin to have symptoms like slurred speech or loss of balance then you should seek emergency medical attention. concussions should not be taken lightly. a concussion is in fact a brain injury. any brain injury is a serious issue. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "the treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is relatively straightforward in most cases. a synthetic form of t4 is given to replace the missing hormone. the dose of the medication is regularly adjusted to maintain a steady blood level of thyroid hormone within the normal range. therefore it is routine practice to monitor the blood level of the thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) while monitoring hypothyroidism during pregnancy. in many respects the treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant women."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal \"red blotch\". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated. jock itch is a possibility. however that rash is usually itchy so that makes me question whether you have jock itch or something else. since i cannot tell based on your description it is something you should get checked out by your doctor. here is more information about jock itch. thank you very much for your input i have determined that it is jock itch and am getting a corticosteroid and some fungal cream as well"

    "Question": "do i need to stay on cholesterol drugs forever?",
    "Answer": "abnormal cholesterol levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (heart attacks and strokes). although many people with high cholesterol will never develop cardiovascular disease it’s impossible to accurately predict who will and who won’t. the first treatment for anyone with abnormal and potentially unhealthy cholesterol levels (dyslipidemia) is to make healthy lifestyle changes. this means exercise most days of the week eat a heart-healthy diet and do not smoke. for people at average risk these actions together are effective at preventing heart attack and stroke. however most people with dyslipidemia find it difficult to improve their cholesterol numbers into the normal range with lifestyle changes alone. and ldl or “bad” cholesterol levels tend to rise with age. the question of whether to treat dyslipidemia with a cholesterol medication like a statin is complex and depends on your expected risk for heart disease as well as your own preferences. if you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke lowering high cholesterol is extremely important to help prevent another one. only you and your doctor can decide if long-term treatment for dyslipidemia is the best option for you."

    "Question": "should i hold off on weight training until i lose weight?",
    "Answer": "absolutely not. lifting weights will not only help you lose weight but maintain the loss. here's why: muscle keeps your metabolism revved up burning calories fat and glucose (sugar). when you lose weight up to 25% of the loss may come from muscle resulting in a slower metabolism. weight lifting will help preserve or rebuild any muscle you lose by dieting. muscle helps you with aerobic exercise. the stronger you are the better you will be at any aerobic activity. weight training improves your body's muscle-to-fat ratio (you end up with less body fat and more muscle) which improves both your health and your fitness level. gaining muscle will help you look better as you define and tone your physique. building strength helps you feel good about yourself. although the scale may show a slight weight gain when you start lifting weights (usually five pounds or less) you probably won't look heavier because the gain is in muscle and your clothes may even fit more loosely. strength training along with cardiovascular exercise can boost your metabolism and can help you expend calories to lose weight. strength training however also has the added benefit of helping you to preserve muscle as well. if you lose weight while only doing cardiovascular exercise some of the weight loss may come from body fat as well as muscle. you want to preserve muscle because it can help to keep your metabolism elevated since muscle burns calories at a higher rate than fat. strength training can also help to promote a more “toned” appearance which would be another added benefit to you as well. the surgeon general recommends that you strength train all major muscle groups two or more days per week. consult your doctor before starting an exercise routine. no you should remaind that it's a continuous process. if you stop it your weight will start increasing."

    "Question": "what conditions mimic food allergy?",
    "Answer": "there are many conditions that can mimic food allergy. the possibilities include not only food allergy but also any other diseases that have symptoms brought on by food. these include reactions to certain chemicals in food for example histamine or food additives food poisoning several other gastrointestinal diseases and psychological symptoms. histamine toxicity: some natural substances (for example histamine) in foods can cause reactions resembling allergy. histamine can reach high levels in cheese some wines and certain fish particularly tuna and mackerel. in fish the histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination especially in fish that has not been refrigerated properly. histamine toxicity has been referred to as pseudoallergic fish poisoning and accounts for over one-third of seafood-related food-borne illnesses according to the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). food additives: another type of food intolerance is an adverse reaction to certain compounds that are added to food to enhance taste provide color or protect against the growth of microorganisms. consumption of large amounts of these additives can produce symptoms that mimic the entire range of allergic symptoms. the compounds most frequently tied to adverse reactions that can be confused with food allergy are yellow dye number 5 monosodium glutamate (msg) and sulfites. yellow dye number 5 can cause hives although rarely. sulfites occur naturally in some foods and wines and are added to others to enhance crispness or prevent the growth of mold. in high concentrations sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. food poisoning: eating food that is contaminated with microorganisms such as bacteria and their products such as toxins is the usual cause of food poisoning. thus the ingestion of contaminated eggs salad milk or meat can produce symptoms that mimic food allergy. common microbes that can cause food poisoning include the noroviruses campylobacter jejuni salmonella listeria monocytogenes vibrio vulnificus and e. coli 0157:h7. lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): another cause of food intolerance which often is confused with a food allergy specifically to milk is lactase deficiency. this common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. this enzyme digests or breaks down lactose a complex sugar in milk to simple sugars which are then absorbed into the blood. if a person has lactase deficiency he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. instead other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose thereby producing gas. symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating abdominal pain and diarrhea. gluten-sensitive enteropathy: intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac sprue. gluten-sensitive enteropathy is caused by a unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat rye and barley. although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. other gastrointestinal diseases: several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea vomiting diarrhea and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. these diseases therefore can resemble food allergies. examples include peptic ulcer gallstones non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion) crohn's disease (regional enteritis) cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis. psychological: some people have a food intolerance that has a psychological origin. in these people a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify a traumatic event in that person's life often during childhood tied to eating a particular food."

    "Answer": "glad you asked! treatment for this type of problem depends on symptoms. it's possible to feel a lot of cracking and popping in the joints (including the back) when performing physical activities but that doesn't mean you actually injured anything. if you're experiencing localized soreness you can probably safely apply ice to the area. the usual protocol is 20 minutes on then 20 minutes off. and never allow ice to directly contact your skin; put a towel between you and the ice pack. if you're experiencing severe pain specific to the spinal area or if you have numbness or tingling in one or both legs then you'd be wise to seek medical attention. many conditions could cause these symptoms from a ruptured vertebral disc to a simple pinched nerve. but you'd certainly want to rule out anything serious. if the pain doesn't get better over the course of a few days a trip to the doctor is in order. you'll need a physical examination and possibly an x-ray to determine what's going on. hope this helps and you feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "understanding your egg supply both origins and ways in which egg number declines can help you to decide your next steps on the pathway to parenthood. women have their lifetime supply of eggs when they are babies inside their mother. eggs are a time-limited and time-released supply: time-limited because all women will someday go through menopause and time-released because each month only a small group of eggs gain the ability to compete to ovulate. as egg number declines with aging the group of eggs competing to ovulate each month gets smaller. with a smaller group of eggs competing each month women tend to ovulate sooner and have fewer days between periods. eventually there are periods of time where an egg is not available and women will start skipping periods. eventually there is not an egg available to ovulate and a woman will no longer have periods. fertility testing includes tests for egg number and egg release. test of egg number include fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) and amh (antimullerian hormone). fsh is the hormone that pushes eggs to move toward ovulation. when egg supply is low fsh goes up. fsh is high in menopause. amh is made by eggs at an earlier stage in their journey toward ovulation. amh is higher in women with more eggs and lower in women with fewer eggs. amh is undetectable in menopause. tests of egg release include progesterone. progesterone is a hormone that is made by the ovary after ovulation. if a woman has an elevated progesterone one week before her period she is ovulating. if she does not she needs to see her doctor to find out why she is not ovulating. the group of eggs that have the ability to ovulate will only compete if they receive the correct signals. a physician will test hormone levels and make the necessary adjustments to induce ovulation. egg number tests like amh and fsh predict how well you will respond to fertility drugs because they reflect the number of eggs competing to ovulate. if fsh is high and amh is low a woman does not have many \"extra eggs\" to respond to medication. if she has regular menstrual cycles with a progesterone proving ovulation she is getting at least one egg out. if we try fertility medications and still get only one egg fertility drugs are not helping to improve chances of pregnancy. as long as she continues to ovulate she has a chance for pregnancy. if she wants to improve her chances after fertility drugs with her own eggs are not helping to increase the number of eggs released she can consider using donated eggs. one percent of women will go through premature ovarian failure (before age 40). a reproductive endocrinologist will test to see why egg number declined early and test to see if other glands (thyroid parathyroid pancreas adrenal) are showing signs of low hormone production. women with pof have a 5-10% lifetime chance of pregnancy if an egg remaining in the ovary gains the ability to ovulate ovulates and meets with sperm. currently there is no way to know when or if this post-ovarian failure ovulation will occur. hearing that egg number is low can be devastating. a second opinion can help increase comfort with the diagnosis. a reproductive psychologist can help to discuss the feelings that arise. egg donation embryo donation and adoption can help women with ovarian failure to build their family."

    "Question": "if you have the hsv-1 virus and recieve oral sex can you spread it to someone who doesnt? with or without a break out?",
    "Answer": "hi still the same answer. hpv is passed from one person to another during skin-to-skin contact with an infected area of the body. hpv can be spread during sex -- including vaginal intercourse anal intercourse and oral sex -- but sex doesn't have to occur for the infection to spread. all that is needed is skin-to-skin contact with an area of the body infected with hpv. the virus can be spread through genital-to-genital contact. it is even possible for a genital infection to spread through hand-to-genital contact. good luck"

    "Question": "how do you know when your estrogen is low?",
    "Answer": "estrogen is the female hormone that is responsible for sexual development and functioning. one of the things estrogen does is regulate the menstrual cycle. as women age their estrogen production gradually lessens. this brings about the symptoms of perimenopause. when estrogen production reaches its lowest point menopause ensues. however estrogen levels can become low in women who aren't the usual age at which perimenopause starts. some reasons for low estrogen in younger women include: very low body fat levels (such as in female athletes) problems with the pituitary gland problems with the ovaries polycystic ovarian syndrom (pcos and others symptoms of low estrogen levels include: irregular periods (or no periods at all) hot flashes (hot flushes) night sweats vaginal dryness loss of sex drive if you're concerned you might have low estrogen levels your best bet is to take a trip to see your gynecologist. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "in general people with lupus should aim for a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits vegetables and whole grains. it should also include moderate amounts of meats poultry and oily fish. lupus is an inflammatory disease. so it’s possible though not proven that foods that fight inflammation could help lupus symptoms. on the other hand foods that fuel inflammation could worsen them. foods with possible anti-inflammatory properties include fruits and vegetables which are rich in substances called antioxidants. in addition foods containing omega-3 fatty acids such as fish nuts ground flaxseed canola oil and olive oil may also help fight inflammation. saturated fats on the other hand can raise cholesterol levels and may contribute to inflammation. sources of saturated fats include fried foods commercial baked goods creamed soups and sauces red meat animal fat processed meat products and high-fat dairy foods. that includes whole milk half and half cheeses butter and ice cream. one food to avoid is alfalfa sprouts. alfalfa tablets have been associated with lupus flares or a lupus-like syndrome that includes muscle pain fatigue abnormal blood test results and kidney problems. these problems may be due to a reaction to an amino acid found in alfalfa sprouts and seeds. this amino acid can activate the immune system and increase inflammation in people with lupus. garlic may also stimulate the immune system."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your mother is going through this and hope the ulcer heals soon. what your doctor called a \"bleeding ulcer\" is usually called a \" peptic ulcer \" today. the likely reason the doctor called this a \"stress ulcer\" is because it used to be thought that mental or emotional stress caused an increase in the production of stomach acid which in turn could eat through a small area of the stomach lining and cause an ulcer (which is a little sore on the inside of the stomach or intestine). however there's no real scientific evidence to support the theory that mental stress causes an increase in stomach acid that leads to ulcers. this relationship may exist but it's not proven. it's still being investigated. that said if your mother is under a lot of stress in her life she owes it to herself to engage in some stress reduction activities. simple things like taking five minutes to close her eyes and focus on deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels. physical activity also is a great stress management tool. listening to music praying or meditating going for a walk -- any or all of these things can reduce the body's physical response to mental stress. if your mom needs help with stress management she can find many resources on the internet. wishing you both well!"

    "Answer": "one of my greatest pleasures in life is to help patients achieve remission of their type 2 diabetes. this means their blood sugar levels have become normal in the absence of any diabetes medication. many clinicians and patients are interested in learning my views about how to go about decreasing and discontinuing diabetes medications. the main role for medications is to help reduce or delay the risk of nasty complications of diabetes particularly the damage to the retina kidney nerves and circulation. the higher the average blood sugar level as indicated by the hemoglobin a1c level the greater the complication risk (which increases exponentially with increasing a1c). we know from clinical trials that using medication to keep the a1c at or below 7% can help reduce the risk of these complications. there is broad agreement that clinicians should recommend starting or increasing diabetes medications to patients who cannot get their a1c level to 7% or less via lifestyle change. many patients come to me because the a1c is already over 7% and their primary care provider proposes increasing their diabetes medication unless the patient can get to 7% or less with improved eating and/or exercise habits. some of these patients are already on many pills and insulin shots are the frequently the next appropriate treatment. many patients would rather make the lifestyle changes than take more medication so when the doctor frames the issue in this way then a patient might become inspired to renew or increase the lifestyle efforts. the clinician might say “let's recheck the a1c in three months and start the new medication if it is still above 7. 0%. ” there can be little doubt that using lifestyle changes to normalize the glucose levels and a1c is a good thing. in contrast the strategy of driving the a1c well below 7. 0% with multiple medications has little to offer most patients in terms of quality of life or reduced risk of complications. most patients i see are already taking metformin which is the preferred second-line treatment after lifestyle change. i typically recommend initiating it in patients with a1c’s of 6. 5% who cannot push it any lower via lifestyle change. for patients who are already on metformin i do not decrease the dose unless the a1c is 6. 0% or less. i might reduce the dose by half every three months as long as the a1c stays at 6. 0% or less. i stop the final 500 mg of metformin when the a1c is 6. 0% or less for at least three months. some drugs can lower the blood sugar levels below the normal range causing symptoms of hypoglycemia. these drugs which include insulin and those in the sulfonylurea family (which are common in patients on more than one kind of diabetes pill) need to be reduced or discontinued by the clinician as required to avoid hypoglycemia so these are typically the first drugs to be discontinued. it is important that patients who take these medications check their blood sugar levels regularly particularly while making lifestyle changes. doing so lets us know the risk of future hypoglycemia and guides the decision about when to decrease or discontinue such medications. in the absence of insulin or sulfonylureas then other drugs (such as pioglitizone) come off next. i typically wait until the a1c is 6. 5% or less to propose stopping such drugs and would not initiate or re-initiate any diabetes drugs (other than metformin as noted above) unless the a1c is above 7. 0%. so in summary ambitious eating and exercise goals are important in all stages of diabetes and drugs are crucially important in patients who cannot otherwise keep the a1c below 7. 0%. it is clear that medications can be avoided delayed or discontinued when lifestyle efforts are intensified and sustained. for many (if not most) patients lifestyle coaching by a clinician dietitian personal trainer peer group etc. can dramatically increase the odds of success. . the first step toward weaning oneself off type 2 diabetic (and almost all medication) is to change the lifestyle that got you to your state of poor health. diet is #1 in my book followed closely by exercise. one can diet all they want and achieve good results but unless you are willing to commit to a change in your lifestyle of eating and or exercise you are wasting your time! you stop eating right you stop exercising right and soon you will be back to where you started sick! 18 yrs ago i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. for 16 of those years i took pills dieted i exercised but never could get this monkey off my back. in fact at one point i gave up and said ok like the doc said you have genetically caused diabetes so learn to live with it! i ballooned to 240 lbs suffered with high blood pressure hi triglycerides and taking the max dosage of lantus and the max dose of metformin. i used the gym on a regular basis but never could get my a1c even to 7. 0! then i discovered a lifestyle of eating that turned all that around. i am at 155lbs now and off all meds and will never go back to eating what people increasingly realizing is the cause of all our health problems the sad american diet! full of additives fructose syrups sugars processed grains processed meats. . once we started to cook with and use unprocessed foods cut out all the “fast foods” junk foods like ice cream all processed grains all fat cuts of meat and ate mostly fresh or fresh cooked veggies and fresh or fresh cooked fruits lots of nuts and seeds (like sunflower). my a1c was 6. 1 my totasl cholesterol was 144 and my b/p 105/65 with a perfect full blood profile in december! step 1 is to make up your mind to take control of your eating and get the unhealthy state of your body turned around. step 2 is make sure you get plenty of exercise get off your duff and walk run join the gym (and go there). if you are handicapped see your doctor about getting help! step 3. (and most important) permanently change your lifestyle of eating. most diabetics can decrease their meds simply by eating the right foods. eventually if you stay on your new lifestyle your insulin resistance will start decreasing and with this you can wean yourself off all med! blood pressure cholesterol diabetic etc. step4. vow never to go back to the lifestyle that got you to type 2 diabetes clogged arteries whatever your health situation was! my recommendation for a lifestyle change is the route i took to heart that really made a difference in my health! they call it the ph diet (you will learn if you read most any of the many books on this they will call it a lifestyle because diets do not work! remember you did something wrong to get you where you are change it and don’t do it again ever! ps: i am now off all meds for any health problem!"

    "Question": "how long are surgeons liable for failed surgery? . i had bilateral ignuinal surgery exactly 6 mos ago. lh is fine rh is not. i fear rh has returned already. is the orginal surgeon obligated to correct this surgery at no charge or should i seek another surgeon?",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. feeling as if a surgery didn't work is never a good thing. you don't describe any symptoms that lead you to the feeling one side of your inguinal hernia repair was unsuccessful. is the surgical site feeling hard? painful? if so these may be normal issues at six months after surgery. for instance as scar tissue builds up it can cause a surgical incision to feel hard. also small nerves that were cut during the surgery may cause pain (especially burning stinging pain) as they \"wake up. \" this process can take weeks to months. i'm not a lawyer and cannot give legal advice (which is essentially what you're asking for). however a surgeon is never \"obligated\" to perform additional surgeries on a patient even if they're considered by the patient as \"corrective. \" i urge you to discuss your concerns directly with your surgeon. as a former surgical nurse i've never known a surgeon who was not eager to make sure his patients were satisfied. if you feel your concerns are not being heard by your original surgeon by all means get a second opinion. like i said many issues that patients interpret as \"problems\" after surgery actually are part of the normal healing process. healing from surgery doesn't occur in a week or a month. depending on each person's individual medical history surgical healing can take many months. and by the way it's not uncommon for one side of a bilateral surgery to heal at a different pace than the other side. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "no this scenerio would indicate a low-risk for hiv transmission. unless you had an open sore or area on your penis. and your \"escort\" had hiv. the risk of transmission through intact skin would be unlikely. having any type of sexual contact with a prostitute (escort) is a high-risk activity so i would strongly advise you against repeating this experience. no. hiv usually requires blood to blood contact. vaginal fluid on intact skin is not a risk and the virus would have died as soon as the fluid dried."

    "Answer": "great idea on starting a food log! since you have both nerve damage and fibromyalgia you are going to have to ease change into your life. so you don't stir your symptoms up. also a quick phone call to your doctor to make sure they are ok with you exercising would be a good first step as well. after you have your doctor's ok here are a few ideas. 1. recumbent stationary bike: these type of exercise bikes have a chair seat and are much more comfortable for individuals with back problems. start slow with just 5 minutes three times a week then as your tolerance builds add a second session of 5 minutes later in the day until eventually you can work up to either 2-15 minute sessions a day or 3-10 minute sessions a day. by splitting your sessions up that should make you more comfortable and avoid aggravating your spine and your fibromyalgia. 2. water aerobics: by moving in water your heart and muscles get the benefits of exercise without all the stress on your spine. look around your community and i'm sure you will find a number of places that offer these. on the day of your first class arrive early and explain to the instructor your limitations so they can provide you with some modifications to exercises that might exacerbate your problem. 3. visit webmd's fibromyalgia center: click on the hyperlink below to be taken there. webmd fibromyalgia center you'll find tons of info on how to maximize your health. there is also a community forum that enables you to talk with others with fibromyalgia that way you can find ideas and strategies that worked for them. 4. don't try to change everything at once. pick one item and work on it then when you've mastered that move onto the next item. for example now that writing down what you eat is a habit pick another one--exercise for example. call around and find a water aerobics class and set a goal of attending 2 classes a week. once you've completed that goal then pick another-------------sleep for example. after you visit the fibromyalgia center you will be amazed how many people are living active lives and managing their symptoms. you can definitely lose weight just take it slow."

    "Answer": "having type 2 diabetes means you need to make the time. having a busy schedule is the norm for everyone. the insulin you take daily makes up for the little insulin that you produce. metformin helps sensitizes your body and muscles to insulin. in people with diabetes the only way to break and improve insulin resistance and reduce your risk of heart disease and other complications is by using muscles. most any type of regularly performed physical activity will do. find something you like it helps increase the chance that you will stick to it. a buddy system for exercise also helps make you more accountable and less likely to miss out on the social mental and physical benefits of exercise. a combination of aerobic type exercise and weights targeting core muscles is something to aim for. find an endocrinologist that is passionate about working with people that have type 2 diabetes."

    "Question": "are sports and energy drinks safe for kids?",
    "Answer": "sports drinks were developed to replace the water and electrolytes lost by training athletes. for athletes who spend long hours training in hot environments some supplementation with these electrolytes may make sense but for almost all ordinary child and adolescent athletes under ordinary circumstances the only thing that needs to be replaced is water. the extra sugars and vitamins won’t do anyone any good. coaches should concentrate on encouraging the best habits for young athletes: drinking water before during and after exercise. energy drinks are different. in addition to electrolytes (especially sodium) they often contain caffeine or caffeine-like compounds along with a witch’s brew of amino acids and herbal products like inositol ginsing taurine and carnitine. vitamins are often thrown into the mix as well. the calorie count of energy drinks is even higher than that of sports drinks and none of these additives is likely to genuinely improve performance — in fact it’s far more likely that children especially will experience toxic side effects rather than any kind of athletic “boost” from these concoctions."

    "Question": "i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend the day after my period can i be pregnant",
    "Answer": "the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is certainly less but not zero. while you may not be ovulating at that time sperm can remain viable inside the female reproductive tract for several days to a week. just loitering around waiting for an egg (ovum) to appear. don't do this again. if you are going to have sex either insist on your partner to use a condom 100% of the time or you need to be taking a more effective form of contraception. unprotected sex is not worth the worry and anxiety that it causes. be smart or you may eventually become pregnant. your body is designed for it."

    "Question": "is quadrivalent vaccine more effective than trivalent?",
    "Answer": "quadrivalent (four virus) flu vaccines are expected to be at least as effective as trivalent (three virus) vaccines since both flu vaccines protect against three of the same influenza viruses. if an influenza b virus that is different from the trivalent vaccine influenza b component circulates the quadrivalent flu vaccine might provide better protection than trivalent flu vaccines by protecting against this additional influenza b virus. cdc evaluates the effectiveness of available flu vaccines throughout the flu season but the quantity and quality of data necessary to compare the effectiveness of different types of flu vaccine usually aren’t available until after the flu season is over and even then can be limited by what vaccine options people purchase or use during the season."

    "Question": "what is the process for obtaining a dental bridge?",
    "Answer": "during the first visit for getting a dental bridge the abutment teeth are prepared. preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. next impressions of your teeth are made which serve as a model from which the bridge pontic and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made. during the second visit your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted as necessary to achieve a proper fit. multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. this is dependent on each individual's case. if the dental bridge is a fixed (permanent) bridge your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. after a couple weeks the bridge is permanently cemented into place."

    "Answer": "allow your partner to take an active role on putting on that condom for you and continue active foreplay with the condom on until you achieve an adequate erection again. there is even a way for a partner to put on your condom with the mouth during oral sex. there is no physical reason why you would be losing your erection but there may be psychological reasons. take your time. don't hurry sexual activity. a supportive and understanding partner can go a long way in helping you correct this issue."

    "Answer": "the height that a person achieves is primarily genetically-determined. every normally healthy person will stop growing at some point. some as early as 14 (usually girls) and some in later teen years (usually boys). the only way to know if growth has stopped is to see an endocrinologist and have an x-ray exam to check the status of his growth plates and perhaps his human growth hormone level. the bone-age test will not show if his growth velocity has slowed down or is slowing down however."

    "Answer": "i can't examine your ear over the internet but i suspect your olive oil-based ear drops have softened/liquefied your ear wax to the point where you now have a complete blockage lying against your eardrum. if you are not having any ear pain or signs of an ear infection you can safely wash out your ear with a gentle stream of warm water (you can use an ear syringe or the shower). this will likely dislodge this waxy mass and your hearing will be miraculously improved. do not use q-tips or you will pack the wax in more tightly."

    "Answer": "the rhinovirus (or other cold virus) enters your body through your nose or mouth and is easily spread when you touch someone or touch common objects contaminated with a cold virus (the computer keyboard or mouse the telephone receiver a doorknob or eating utensils). if you aren't cautious about hand washing you can spread the common cold to family friends co-workers and people you've never met at a restaurant or the supermarket. of course if someone with a cold or flu sneezes or coughs around you the virus can spread that way too. while getting chilled or wet is not a cause of common colds there are factors that make you more susceptible to catching a cold virus. for example you are more likely to catch a common cold if you are excessively fatigued have emotional distress or have allergies with nose and throat symptoms."

    "Answer": "hi there! the best support is that when you are sick with the norovirus you should never touch someone because norovirus is very contagious. or if you touch a surface and your husband touches that infected surface he will most likely get sick. norovirus can be caused by food poisoning and it can lead to nausea vomiting headaches and other cramps and discomforts. the best thing to do while being sick with the virus is to wear rubber gloves and don't hug or kiss if you are sick. just keep in mind that norovirus is more serious than regular stomach virus."

    "Answer": "do not panic. there are a number of reasons that could explain a late period. sometimes your menstrual cycle can get a little nifty and change it’s times and dates. if you are feeling like you normally do when you have your period then you are most likely to start it properly any time soon. sometimes you may get the same side effects of your usual period and a little spotting up to a whole week before you actually begin. however this is no reason for you to worry it’s nothing unusual and it does not mean that there is something wrong with you. i understand you say that you are 100% positive and certain that you can not be pregnant however i still must include as much as i can to help you and provide you with the necessary information. so if you have had sexual intercourse since your last period whether it was protected or not then i recommend that if you still have not started your period a week after it is supposed to be due then to take a pregnancy test just to be on the safe side. however it is not only pregnancy that can prevent you from receiving your period. there are other possible ways and i will list them here for you. stress: you may realise that you are at a moment in life where you are becoming overly stressed. emotional stress can be a possible reason for your period to act up if this is the case then once you’re stress levels sink back down then you will most likely find that your period will resume back to normal. medication: are you taking any new or different medication at the moment? sometimes certain medications can prevent your period. especially contraceptives and some chemotherapy drugs. hormonal imbalance: you could have an hormonal imbalance such as polycystic ovarian syndrome which is the most common form of hormonal imbalance. well-balanced diet: are you eating properly and healthily? sometimes women who become malnourished or under weight stop receiving their periods. exercise: have you recently started taking up exercise or anything active? you may be overdoing it sometimes vigorous exercise can also be another reason for your period not coming or being late. if you do not believe that any of these reasons can explain your late/missed period then i strongly advise you to arrange an appointment with your gp as only he/she will be able to give you a definite answer. until then please do not worry yourself just wear protection incase you do begin and just carry on as normal."

    "Question": "at 6 years old my active daughter weighs 80 pounds wears size 14/16 clothes and has low self esteem. what can we do?",
    "Answer": "clearly you need to check in with your pediatrician and make certain that your daughter does not have a host of metabolic conditions that could be contributing to her weight gain. in addition look at your family history (yours and the father of your child). if there's a strong family history of obesity she may have inherited the genetic tendency to gain weight. that being said she can't gain weight without overeating relative to her needs. once she's checked out for medical problems you need to request a pediatric dietitian referral and work out a plan that will get results. she's clearly overeating relative to her needs. you'll experiment and refine her dietary intake. she'll also need you as parents to mentor her with your good nutrition habits. she needs a healthy lifestyle-friendly environment to achieve her goals."

    "Answer": "finding the cause or causes of hives is very clinically difficult. there are no tests that would conclusively determine the specific cause. you can due hundreds of tests and perhaps get a few things that show up positive but that does not prove this is the specific cause. there are no tests for \"rare causes\" unfortunately. of course you and her mother are frustated. who wouldn't be? frustration does not make it any easier in finding a cause so the next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that works. and something that she can take every day."

    "Question": "what happens to someone when they get dementia?",
    "Answer": "how quickly dementia progresses depends on what is causing it and the area of the brain that is affected. some types of dementia progress slowly over several years. other types may progress more rapidly. if vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes the loss of mental skills may be gradual. if it is caused by a single stroke in a large blood vessel loss of function may occur suddenly. the course of dementia varies greatly from one person to another. early diagnosis and treatment with medicines used for alzheimer's (cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil [ aricept ]) may help preserve mental functioning for a while in people with vascular dementia dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson's disease. 1 even without these medicines some people remain stable for months or years while others decline rapidly. many people with dementia are not aware of their mental decline. they may deny their condition and blame others for the problems they experience. those who are aware may mourn their loss of abilities and become hopeless and depressed. depending on the type of dementia the person's behavior may eventually become out of control. the person may become angry agitated and combative or clingy and childlike. he or she may wander and become lost. these problems can make it difficult for family members or others to continue providing care at home. even with the best care people with dementia tend to have a shorter life span than the average person their age. death usually results from lung or kidney infections caused by being bedridden. what to think about many older people have a slight loss of mental skills (usually recent memory) that doesn't affect their daily functioning. this is called mild cognitive impairment by some. people who have mild impairment may be in the early stage of dementia or they may stay at their present level of ability for a long time. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "you ask a good question. many people have concerns about going under general anesthesia even when they're in good health. certainly a generally healthy 73-year old man would not be at much higher risk of complications from general anesthesia than anyone else. however that doesn't matter because the individual has stated he doesn't want to go under general anesthesia. and you know what? that might be ok. depending on how bad the umbilical hernia is he might be able to have the procedure done under sedation -- much like what you get when you have a colonoscopy. it's enough iv medication to keep you comfortably drowsy but no breathing tube is involved and waking up generally is quick. the patient might also be able to have the umbilical hernia repaired under just local anesthesia (numbing injections to the area) if the hernia isn't too severe. i suggest the gentleman discuss his concerns with a surgeon. if one surgeon won't consider doing the repair under sedation or local anesthesia feel free to consult others. it may not sound logical but you might consider consulting a plastic and reconstructive surgeon because they have other tissue-numbing methods at their disposal that might work well for someone who's reluctant to undergo general anesthesia. i hope the gentleman gets his umbilical hernia repaired because it's usually a pretty straightforward procedure and his quality of life likely will be greatly improved afterwards. wishing you well!"

(most people get only half as much as they need. ) eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. whole-grain products and beans are also great sources of fiber. if you can't get enough fiber in your diet -- which is really the best means of getting fiber -- fiber supplements are a good way to fill in the gap. incorporate more fiber into your diet slowly to give your body time to get used to it. along with more fiber you need to drink a lot of water. eating more fiber without drinking more water may cause constipation which can make diverticulosis worse. also nuts and seeds are good sources of fiber. if you've heard that seeds and nuts are bad for people with diverticulosis don’t believe it. that's a myth."

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of migraine headaches?",
    "Answer": "migraine is a chronic condition of recurrent attacks. most (but not all) migraine attacks are associated with headaches. migraine headaches usually are described as an intense throbbing or pounding pain that involves one temple. (sometimes the pain is located in the forehead around the eye or in the back of the head). the pain usually is unilateral (on one side of the head) although about a third of the time the pain is bilateral. the unilateral headaches typically change sides from one attack to the next. (in fact unilateral headaches that always occur on the same side should alert the doctor to consider a secondary headache for example one caused by a brain tumor). a migraine headache usually is aggravated by daily activities such as walking upstairs. nausea vomiting diarrhea paleness cold hands cold feet and sensitivity to light and sound commonly accompany migraine headaches. as a result of this sensitivity to light and sound migraine sufferers usually prefer to lie in a quiet dark room during an attack. a typical attack lasts between four and 72 hours. an estimated 40% to 60% of migraine attacks are preceded by premonitory (warning) symptoms lasting hours to days. the symptoms may include sleepiness irritability fatigue depression or euphoria yawning and cravings for sweet or salty foods. patients and their family members usually know that when they observe these warning symptoms that a migraine attack is beginning. an estimated 20% of migraine headaches are associated with an aura. usually the aura precedes the headache although occasionally it may occur simultaneously with the headache. the most common auras are 1) flashing brightly colored lights in a zigzag pattern (fortification spectra) usually starting in the middle of the visual field and progressing outward and 2) a hole (scotoma) in the visual field also known as a blind spot. some elderly migraine sufferers may experience only the visual aura without the headache. a less common aura consists of pins-and-needles sensations in the hand and the arm on one side or pins-and-needles sensations around the mouth and the nose on the same side. other auras include auditory (hearing) hallucinations and abnormal tastes and smells. complicated migraines are migraines that are accompanied by neurological dysfunction. the part of the body that is affected by the dysfunction is determined by the part of the brain that is responsible for the headache. vertebrobasilar migraines are characterized by dysfunction of the brain stem (the lower part of the brain that is responsible for automatic activities like consciousness and balance). the symptoms of vertebrobasilar migraines include fainting as an aura vertigo (dizziness in which the environment seems to be spinning) and double vision. hemiplegic migraines are characterized by paralysis or weakness of one side of the body or mimicking a stroke. the paralysis or weakness is usually temporary but sometimes it can last for days. retinal or ocular migraines are rare attacks characterized by repeated instances of scotomata (blind spots) or blindness on one side lasting less than an hour that can be associated with headache. irreversible vision loss can be a complication of this rare form of migraine. for approximately 24 hours after a migraine attack the migraine sufferer may feel drained of energy and may experience a low-grade headache along with sensitivity to light and sound. unfortunately some sufferers may have recurrences of the headache during this period."

    "Answer": "it all depends what prescription meds we are referring to. i would have to ask this patient what else are they on? now tylenol pm and nyquil and those products do contain acetaminophen or tylenol in them. tylenol pm also contains benadryl or diphenhydramine and if they are taken with other products or other prescription meds we could have some side effect issues like increased drowsiness. also we want to make sure that people don't overdose on tylenol or acetaminophen and they may not realize that it may be in some of their prescription products. nyquil we also need to know which nyquil they are on. sometimes there is different versions of nyquil that might have a cough suppressant or a nasal decongestant or it does contain alcohol. so we want to be real careful about the patients that are taking that. we want to make sure too that they are not taking them together. i always encourage patients to come and talk to the pharmacist. labels can be confusing and now when you go down the cough and cold aisle everything sometimes looks the same but we have to read the box and we have to see what the ingredients are and what the dosing is. if you have your medication list on you as a pharmacist i can make sure that there will be no interactions or problems down the road with your other prescription medications other otcs or vitamins and herbal supplements."

    "Question": "a 22month old with a arm temp of 101. 5 & doesn't want to play which is not normal for him. . he has been drinking fluids alittle. but he has been sleeping alot. i also had given him tylenol at 7:00am. but doesn't seem to be helping. should i be alittle worried cause it definitely not like him to not be playing or sleeping alot?",
    "Answer": "toddlers are a viral magnets so the most likely underlying cause for the little fever would be his body fighting off a viral invader. fever is not dangerous and the fact that he has slowed down a bit is probably good for both of you. this is just a guess however since i do not know his medical history or have a way of examining him. most viral infections last a week but the fever stage tends to be 3-4 days only. you do not have to treat a fever but you do have to make sure that you treat the misery. tylenol is fine but don't let the thermometer tell you what to do. let his mood dictate the need for tylenol. if he is doing fine with a minor fever just leave it alone. keep him hydrated and if he is showing any signs of an ear infection. sore throat. etc. you can having him examined by his medical provider. it is okay to wait a few days however to see if his immune system will take care of his illness."

    "Question": "how is rh sensitization during pregnancy treated?",
    "Answer": "if you are sensitized to the rh factor if your blood is rh-negative and you have been sensitized to rh-positive blood you now have antibodies to rh-positive blood. the antibodies kill rh-positive red blood cells. if you become pregnant with an rh-positive baby ( fetus ) the antibodies can destroy your fetus's red blood cells. this can cause anemia. if you are already rh-sensitized and are pregnant your treatment will focus on preventing or minimizing fetal harm and on avoiding early (preterm) delivery. treatment options depend on how well or poorly the fetus is doing. if testing shows that your fetus is rh-positive but is only mildly affected by your rh factor antibodies you will be closely monitored until your pregnancy reaches term. your fetus will be delivered early only if his or her condition worsens. if testing shows that your fetus is moderately affected by your rh antibodies your fetus's condition will be closely monitored until his or her lungs are mature enough for a preterm delivery. a cesarean section may be used to deliver the baby quickly or to avoid the difficulty of inducing labor before term. a moderately affected newborn sometimes requires a blood transfusion immediately after birth. if testing shows that your fetus is severely affected by your rh factor antibodies a blood transfusion may be given before birth ( intrauterine fetal blood transfusion ). this can be done through the fetus's abdomen or directly into the fetus's umbilical cord. a preterm delivery is likely to be needed. multiple blood transfusions are sometimes needed to keep a fetus healthy until the fetal lungs mature enough to function after birth. often a cesarean section is done to deliver the baby quickly. a blood transfusion is sometimes needed immediately after birth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "how do dandruff shampoos get rid of dandruff? what's the difference between selenium sulphide and zinc pyrithione?",
    "Answer": "there is two basic types of targeting dandruff with the dandruff shampoos; one is to eliminate the scale and one is to affect the underlying cause. somebody who has very thick scale and heavy dandruff you might need both products because until you get rid of some of the scale the active ingredient won't actually reach the skin to have the proper effect. so the first products to get rid of some of this scale would be something like salicylic acid that helps loosen the scale and eliminate it from the skin. the zinc pyrithione and the selenium sulphide target the underlying yeast or fungus that can cause the dandruff to begin with. so you might need both products and you can either use them one after the other or alternate one shampoo one and the next shampoo the other. afterwards you can still use your own shampoo if you prefer. so it's a lot of shampooing but for some people who really prefer their own shampoo or don't like the way these products smell you can still use your own shampoo after and you can certainly condition afterwards as well."

    "Answer": "i suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other. your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work. they also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual. your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety. your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets. the diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably \"weight watchers\". counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system. do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself (such as new clothing) upon reaching pivotal goals. if you have a dietary setback don't let it be your reason to throw in the towel. as the old chinese proverb suggests. \"fall down 7 times; get back up 8 times. \""

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you went through such a scary episode but i'm glad it was a migraine and not a stroke! \"complex migraine \" is a term used to identify rare types of migraine headaches that have specific symptoms not usually associated with a common or classic migraine. for example a classic migraine usually starts with a visual disturbance (called an \"aura\") and then proceeds to a painful headache. a complex migraine may fall under one of these types: hemiplegic which includes temporary paralysis or weakness on one side of the body (often mimicking a stroke) retinal which includes loss of vision in one eye basilar artery which usually affects young women and includes symptoms such as confusion and difficulty speaking ophthalmoplegic which includes pain and paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye status migrainosus which is a severe migraine that lasts for days it sounds like you may have experienced a hemiplegic migraine or a basilar artery migraine. just because you had one migraine doesn't mean it will ever happen again. that's the tricky thing about these headaches. often doctors will wait to treat a patient until they've had multiple migraines over a course of time. that may be why you were sent home without any treatment. if you have any questions about your migraine experience i suggest you follow up with your primary health care provider. he or she can help you understand what happened and if you need treatment. wishing you all the best!"

    "Answer": "it is great that you have an appointment scheduled with the doctor on monday. i can understand your concern but the best action to take until monday is to relax take care of yourself and enjoy life. the webmd audience is knowledgeable but cannot confirm or deny your suspicions based solely on the information contained in your question. of course some of your symptoms could be as a result of colon cancer but could also be the result of some other gi disturbance. your situation is unique and deserves to be professionally assessed with diagnostic tools such as a colonoscopy blood testing and imaging studies. the link below is from a webmd article that describes colon cancer in greater detail. <link>. i wish you the best."

    "Answer": "sorry to hear you're going through this. whatever it is it sounds unpleasant! it certainly could be food poisoning though usually the first sign of that is diarrhea. with your symptoms coming on the heels of a holiday in which food takes center stage i certainly wouldn't rule out food poisoning. cotton mouth can be a sign of severe dehydration. if your symptoms don't clear up within a day or two or if you have little to no urine output then you probably should consider going to the emergency room for iv fluids. because you have diabetes you're at increased risk for complications from food poisoning. chief among these complications is dehydration. be sure to drink plenty of fluids if you can keep them down. if your vomiting lasts more than one day you need to seek medical attention. in addition to drinking plain water to treat your dehydration you can sip a non-sugary sports beverage to help maintain your electrolyte balance. general rules of thumb: if you spike a high fever (101f or above); if you develop new symptoms such as blurred or double vision muscle weakness extreme dizziness or confused thinking; or if you have difficulty breathing you should always call 911. otherwise you're probably fine to take a \"watchful waiting\" approach to see if your symptoms get better. wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery!"

    "Answer": "i don't think i ever appreciated how much time and energy was involved with breastfeeding until i watched our two ravenous boys in action. as a pediatrician and lactation counselor i can tell you that it is completely normal (and expected) for young babies to want to cluster feed every 1 to 1 1/2 hours -- especially during growth spurts around 3 and 6 weeks of age. the good news is that frequent cluster feedings will help to establish and increase a mom's milk supply. the downside is that it is exhausting and sometimes painful. it will get better though. as your baby cluster feeds your milk supply should increase and with time your baby's capacity to take in more milk will increase. soon he will start to space out his feedings."

    "Question": "now that i'm in my 60s is it ok to eat just one healthy meal a day?",
    "Answer": "eating only one meal a day is not enough for several reasons. it's highly likely that you're not going to get the nutrients you need to stay strong and healthy. you need protein to keep your muscles strong. you need fruits and vegetables to get important vitamins minerals and antioxidants. and you need a steady stream of carbohydrates to keep your energy up. by eating only one solid meal a day your metabolism is going to take a nosedive. when you go many hours without eating your body goes into starvation mode which contributes to the loss of muscle mass. we already tend to lose muscle as we get older. so not eating at least three solid meals a day could make that happen faster. if you find that you're not hungry throughout the day take a walk. physical activity can often help stimulate the appetite. you want to make sure you're giving your muscles the fuel they need and consuming the right amount of nutrients to stay healthy."

    "Answer": "i would definitely recommend seeing a doctor or a healthcare provider. one of the common causes of insomnia is pain and we all are realizing now that your level of pain is different than my level of pain and that could be the cause of it. the other thing is what pain pills are we taking? are they taking a lot of acetaminophen or tylenol? are they are also taking motrin or ibuprofen? what other sleep aids are they taking on top of that? do they realize that tylenol pm has tylenol in it on top of all these acetaminophen they are taking? so we want to make sure that the healthcare provider or doctor is aware of this situation. the pharmacist needs to be aware of this situation in case they are taking any prescription medications on top of it and their pain really needs to be assessed. even though they say it's doing okay there are some prescription medications or they may have to go to physical therapy; which should be better options for them and they may not have to rely on so many medications. they may also not be feeling well in general. the side effects from the medication the drowsiness or upset stomach could lead to bigger problems down the road. so i would highly encourage that person to definitely consider seeing at least a primary care physician for just an evaluation and to make sure everything is in check."

    "Answer": "plaques from atherosclerosis can: stay within the artery wall. there the plaque grows then stops. they don't block blood flow so may never cause symptoms. grow in a slow controlled way into the path of blood flow. eventually they cause significant blockages. pain on exertion (in the chest or legs) is the usual symptom. in the worst case they can suddenly rupture allowing blood to clot inside an artery. in the brain this causes a stroke; in the heart a heart attack. the plaques cause three kinds of cardiovascular disease: coronary artery disease: stable plaques in the heart's arteries cause angina (chest pain on exertion). sudden plaque rupture and clotting causes heart muscle to die. this is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. cerebrovascular disease: ruptured plaques in the brain's arteries causes strokes with potential for permanent brain damage. temporary artery blockages can also cause transient ischemic attacks (tias) warning signs of stroke; however there is no brain injury. peripheral artery disease: narrowing in the arteries of the legs caused by plaque. that causes poor circulation pain on walking and poor wound healing. severe disease may lead to amputations."

    "Answer": "neither klonopin (clonazepam) nor amitriptyline is an mao (monoamineoxidase) inhibitor. but that doesn't mean you should mix them. clonazepam (klonopin) is a benzodiazepine. that means it's in the same class of anti-anxiety drugs as valium. it is also used to treat seizures and panic attacks. amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. tricyclic antidepressants are the oldest of the antidepressant medications. amitriptyline helps elevate mood. if your health care provider has prescribed both clonazepam and amitriptyline for you then he or she feels they are safe for you to take. however no one should combine medications without the advice of a physician nurse practitioner or pharmacist. if you have any questions about medications your health care provider has prescribed for you you'd be well-advised to make an appointment to discuss all your medications with your provider. he or she can explain what each medication is for and make sure that none of your medications conflict with each other. i hope this information helps!"

    "Answer": "hi your find its a very old wives tale to mothers who are not getting pregnant. but having said that there is an outside chance of exposure to cat litter that harbours toxoplasmosis which can cause miscarriage and/or birth defects but you would need to be pretty dumb as this would involve handling cats faeces with bare hands. i don't know about you but we have always had a pooper scooper. we have had around us since we first got married my wife has had two children who now have kids and also had cats around them. i think your vet needs a warning hung round his neck. good luck"

    "Answer": "i am a little concerned about the fact that this patient called it a \"bad burn. \" based on that description my fear is that there could be a skin infection possibility and it may not be healing properly. if the skin has blistered or is broken it needs to be evaluated by a physician or health care provider as soon as possible. i would not recommend putting antibiotic ointment on it due to the fact that there is limited data that it evens helps – you usually need oral antibiotics to help the skin layers underneath and leave uncovered."

    "Question": "which is better for adult dry skin; cool mist humidifier or warm steam vaporizer?",
    "Answer": "what is better is a moisturizing cream or lotion. exposure to humidity -- steam or cool mist -- is not going to be absorbed through your skin and make it moist again. chronically dry skin is usually genetic (atopic dermatitis eczema) and will likely improve by a good non-perfumed moisturizer and perhaps some topical steroids but if you want to increase your humidity for other reasons the cool mist (the ultrasonic types) are the best in my opinion."

    "Answer": "i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an \"expert\" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail."

    "Answer": "feel at least comforted that everybody has stretch marks so this is a universal problem from women. i have not seen one person ever who doesn't have stretch marks. what causes stretch marks is the rate of gain of weight. it just happens that if you gain weight at a certain rate a little bit faster than your skin can grow that's when a stretch mark occurs but you often don't see it till you lose the weight that's when you start to see it. so trying to control the weight is one way to avoid future stretch marks. once the stretch mark is there the sad truth is that there is absolutely no treatment out there that will eliminate it. people have tried a whole bunch of different things like lasers and retinoids and the doctor who figures out how to really truly solve the stretch mark will be a very well-loved and very rich doctor because everybody wants this taken care of. but as of yet there are some studies ongoing using lasers to treat stretch marks but there is nothing that i have seen that i think is effective and worth spending money on to try to treat a stretch mark."

    "Answer": "hi well i can say your not alone if you google smell under your beasts you can find more info but here are some bits that may help but remember we are what we eat so could be something in there? so there is grapefruit seed extract mix a few drops in water and wash twice daily with it or you could try some cut lemon and wipe the area and let dry they say it should go in a couple of days. ok they say it could be a yeast fungus so your could try dabbing some boric acid powder on the area and you could also try this as well a 1/4 teaspoon in a litre of water shake well drink through the day this way you attacking it from both sides if works that way don't worry i take boric acid daily for raynards disease and ed works for both. hope this helps. good luck"

    "Answer": "take these everyday steps to help prevent the spread of germs and protect your health and the health of your family: cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or sneeze into your sleeve. throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. wash your hands often with soap and warm water especially after you cough or sneeze. if soap and water are not available an alcohol-based hand rub can be used. avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth. germs spread this way. try to avoid close contact with sick people. pay attention to your body and how you are feeling. if you think you have the flu call your doctor or clinic right away. if you are pregnant and you live with or have close contact with someone who has the flu talk with your doctor about medicines to prevent flu. and have a plan for someone else to take care of a sick family member. stock up on household health and emergency supplies such as acetaminophen (acetamin panadol tylenol) water and non-perishable foods."

    "Answer": "assuming you have a 28 day (regular) cycle you'll start your period on day one around day 14 you ovulate - this is when the sperm can fertilize the egg give or take a day or two. if you're bleeding before your period is due it could be implantation bleeding - which is when the fertilized egg (assuming conception worked) is attaching to the wall of the uterus. if it is implantation bleeding it should be light red or brownish in color and only last a day or two at the longest. implantation bleeding occurs 6 - 12 days after conception (having sex). so going off a 28 day cycle that's day 20 - 26. two days later your period would normally come starting the cycle over with day one again."

    "Question": "can a mask prevent swine flu?",
    "Answer": "while a mask could theoretically help prevent swine flu it’s a bit much for most people and really not necessary. . . sure if someone is coughing or sneezing in your face a mask might help. also if you know that you're going to be around someone with swine flu such as a loved one a mask might be warranted. but otherwise that’s not the most effective strategy for preventing swine flu because you don't catch most respiratory viruses from people coughing in your face. here's what generally happens. someone with a virus sneezes or coughs in their hand. then they touch something like an elevator button or a doorknob. you come along a few minutes later and touch that same button or knob. then without thinking about it you touch your face -- your mouth nose or eyes -- and the virus takes hold of you. as mundane as it sounds the most effective way to prevent getting respiratory viruses like swine flu is washing your hands. but most of us don’t do it often enough and don’t do it the right way."

    "Question": "what can i do if naps make me groggy?",
    "Answer": "one of the questions or at least problems that some people tell me dr. breus i take a nap and i feel worse when i get up than i did when i fell asleep. well that means that you’ve napped too long because then you’ve gone into deep sleep and you’re going to have a real hard time pulling yourself out of that deep sleep. now is it just because you woke up in the middle of that deep sleep? generally speaking if you wake up in the middle of that deep sleep it’s really hard to shake that sleepy feeling and that’s when you don’t feel so good. what can you do if that does happen to you? truthfully there’s not a whole lot. you could have some caffeine which would help bring you out of it. caffeine by the way i don’t have a problem with caffeine i don’t have a problem with people drinking coffee i just want them to do it responsibly and know and understand the effects of caffeine. so if you wake up from a nap and you feel worse than you did before having some caffeine will probably help. the biggest thing that’s going to help though is walking outside and getting sunlight. sunlight is it directly affects your body’s ability to produce melatonin. because remember you don’t produce melatonin in the light. so if you wake up and you don’t feel so hot before you go and grab that soda or coffee i’d say walk outside and get a little bit of sunlight and even walk around a little bit and you should be able shake yourself out of it pretty quick."

    "Answer": "sorry you're experiencing this. do you know what is causing the swelling? for instance did you injure your knee in some way? or did it suddenly just balloon up? do you have a prosthetic knee (knee replacement)? the reason i ask is because any of those things could cause swelling and the treatment might be different for each cause. you're doing the right thing by elevating your knee. the ice is probably ok if you think the swelling is due to an injury. otherwise the ice is probably useless. and at that ice generally is only indicated for a few days post-injury. if this is a chronic problem (you've had it happen before) or if it doesn't clear up within a few days or if the swelling is accompanied by redness and heat in the joint plus a fever then i'd suggest you seek medical attention. hope this helps and you feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "the short answer is: yes. unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes. it doesn't matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion \"barely touched\" your penis. a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it's not active. your girlfriend's herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion. this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you're flirting with disaster. you need to take better precautions in the future. there is no cure for genital herpes. if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them. they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you. and while condom use is good be aware a condom won't necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that aren't covered by the sheath. i'm not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner. even if you're not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story. please stop engaging in unsafe sex. always use a condom. don't have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease. you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices. wishing you well! there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good."

    "Answer": "sweat contains ammonia and with strenuous exercise more ammonia is produced and sweated out. in some people enough ammonia is present to give its characteristic odor to their sweat. the more strenuous or lengthy the exercise session the greater the amount of ammonia that gets into sweat. in clinical studies ammonia went up in people’s sweat regardless of the type of exercise or what they had eaten first. there’s no proof that an ammonia smell in sweat means you aren’t eating enough protein or working out too strenuously or anything in particular. not everyone produces and excretes ammonia at the same rate so one person’s sweat may have a stronger ammonia odor than someone else’s even if they are exercising about the same amount. the odor of normal urine can reflect what has been consumed or specific diseases. urine is high in nitrates compounds high in nitrogen and oxygen. ammonia (nh3) is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen what you are smelling is the high concentration of bonded nitrogen. ammonia is smaller more volatile and more mobile than urea. if allowed to accumulate ammonia would raise the ph in cells to toxic levels. therefore many organisms convert ammonia to urea there is no odor to my sweat it occurs at night it is not excessive night sweats. it has taken the color out of my pillowcase & sheet."

    "Question": "what causes osteoarthritis?",
    "Answer": "there are many factors that can increase a person's chance of developing oa including: *obesity. maintaining an ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis of the knees and hips. weight loss or maintenance also can decrease oas rate of progression once the disease is established. * injury. people with joint injuries due to sports work-related activity or accidents may be at increased risk of developing oa. for example athletes with knee-related injuries may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. in addition people who have had a severe back injury may be predisposed to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. people who have had a broken bone near a joint are prone to develop osteoarthritis in that joint. * heredity. some people have an inherited defect in one of the genes responsible for making cartilage. this can cause defective cartilage which leads to more rapid deterioration of joints. people born with joint abnormalities are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and those born with an abnormality of the spine (such as scoliosis a curvature of the spine) are more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. * joint overuse. overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing oa. for example people in jobs requiring repeated bending of the knee are at increased risk for developing oa of the knee. * age. although age is a risk factor research has shown that oa is not an inevitable part of aging."

    "Answer": "assuming your husband was properly diagnosed (many skin lesions will mimic ringworm/tinea corporis) an antifungal medication (there are several over the counter medications that the pharmacist could suggest) would likely help. if you are talking about a vaginal yeast medication being used i would suggest that you use one more geared for skin fungus. he will not grow boobs. several of my cats got ringworm they kept spreading it between them. i used monistat on their lesions. it really helped."

    "Answer": "sleeping in a slightly elevated position will help some. you can also ask your doctor to give you a simple device that allows you to excercise your lungs and airway. it is a plastic device usually has a small ball in the bottom of it and the goal is to keep using it until you can bring the ball further and further towards the top. as you consistently do this it will strengthen your ability to breathe better. you are basically exercising your lungs just as you are excercising other parts of your body as you do when you get on your exercise bike. as with any exercise program when you first begin you may find with your diminished lung capacity you are not able to do a great deal at first but if you stick with it every day even with the copd you will have better air way function breathe better and be stronger. let me know after 90 days of doing this several times a day if it helped i believe you will find that you are breathing easier and getting some relief from your morning coughing spells. just remember you have copd and nothing is going to just make it go away and suddently you are not coughing that is just not being realistic. if you stick with it however it should help you and allow you to breathe easier in the am"

    "Answer": "the last five day treatment is probably azithromycin - an antibiotic that you take for five days but stays working for ten. this drug is convenient to take but many of the pathogens that cause middle ear infections in children are now resistant to it. the first drug was probably amoxicillin. your son may need something else assuming the infection is a bacterial type. many ear infections are viral. a child under six months who is getting ear infection is more likely to be a frequent-flyer of sorts. they may end up getting lots of them and often end up getting tubes. a child in day-care or one exposed to tobacco smoke is likely to get more ear infections. a child who was not or is not breat fed will also get more. the next step may be to see an ent specialist for a consultation. if your child has middle ear fluid that has been persistent the ent may recommend tubes."

    "Question": "i sprained my ankle 7 months ago and still am not 100%. 7 months ago i slipped on ice outside my driveway and heard a large pop sound when i fell. at present day i can walk comfortably. i have full range of motion in all directions except upwards. meaning if i grab my foot and pull it towards me. there is pain inside my ankle (in the ligaments that were damaged in the fall i assume). i'm trying to exercise it by putting half my foot on a raised object like a curb or books and gently push down. what can i do to improve the healing process?",
    "Answer": "i \"sprained\" my own ankle about 20 years ago and it still hurts. unfortunately i waited too long to get a proper diagnosis assuming it was \"just a sprain\". i tore some ligaments and because of the delay in having an mri it could not be repaired. i suggest that you do not repeat my own mistake and have a proper examination either by an orthopedist or podiatrist that handles ankle disorders. you may need some imaging studies as well. i am a board-certified physical therapist with over 13 years of clinical experience. physical therapists are experts in assessing and treating problems with the neuromusculoskeletal system including ankle injuries and sprains. i highly recommend that you seek the professional opinion of a well-respected physical therapist in your area. physical therapists focus their practice on macro-biological movement sciences (as opposed to micro-biological pathology). what does that mean to you? not only will a pt help you determine if you have ‘loose’ or possibly ‘torn’ ankle ligaments but he or she will perform a thorough examination of your entire lower body to determine what is at the root of your continued pain – often a dysfunctional movement pattern that is due in part to the initial injury but perpetuated by a host of factors. if you see a physical therapist you will have an initial examination to determine a “differential diagnosis”. the pt will take a thorough history and screen you to determine if there is a medical condition that requires you to see a physician for further medical workup. second the physical therapist will determine a “movement impairment diagnosis” that will help direct physical therapy interventions. in your question you state that ankle dorsiflexion (moving the foot upwards) is limited and painful. otherwise you do not state why you are not “100%”. with limited dorsiflexion some common activities that might be painful are deep squatting running jumping and stairs. the great thing about seeing a physical therapist is that he or she will work with you to find the root causes that are driving this continued pain and limited motion (we will go beyond treating your symptoms). these causes may or may not include things such as: joint stiffness scar tissue flexibility restrictions decreased proprioception (balance ability and coordination/control) muscle weakness and altered biomechanics. these impairments can respond very well to conservative physical therapy treatments. regarding an earlier answer that was posted mris and surgery are rarely needed even with severe ankle sprains. if your injury was more recent and you were having trouble walking x-rays might be more highly indicated to rule out possible bony pathology. again a physical therapist can safely and effectively guide you in your treatment course even if you require referral for further medical workup. even in the case of severe ankle injuries such as fractures that are treated surgically or non-surgically i see that patients recover best when physician care is followed by physical therapy rehabilitation. in all 50 states you can directly consult with a physical therapist without a physician referral. many major insurance plans reimburse physical therapy care without a physician referral (medicare is a significant exception). a pt is the expert of choice to perform a thorough examination and treat this problem of yours that will not go away. if your insurance does not cover direct access and you would like for insurance to cover the visit then i suggest you see your physician and request a referral the physical therapist of your choice. if you need help finding a therapist you may find assistance through the american board of physical therapy specialties: <link> or the american physical therapy association: <link> i wish you the best as you seek to restore full functional use of your ankle! truly rich"

    "Question": "what does it mean when you exercise and sweat and then begin to itch?",
    "Answer": "this is quite common. it's most likely due to an allergic-like reaction during exercise. during exercise histamines are released and some people are sensitive to them. people sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but can be on the arms or neck too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (e. g. antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. if the problem is bothering you so much that you can't stand it and it doesn't go away during the exercise session (it may just pass if you continue) then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter anti-histamine (like benadryl) 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter anti-histamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedative anti-histamine. you should only take over-the-counter or prescription medication for this problem after speaking with your doctor."

    "Answer": "psoriatic arthritis is a diagnosis made mainly on clinical grounds based on a finding of psoriasis and the typical inflammatory arthritis of the spine and/or other joints. there is no laboratory test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. blood tests such as sedimentation rate may be elevated and merely reflect presence of inflammation in the joints and other organs of the body. other blood tests such as rheumatoid factor are obtained to exclude rheumatoid arthritis. when one or two large joints (such a knees) are inflamed arthrocentesis can be performed. arthrocentesis is an office procedure whereby a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. the fluid is then analyzed for infection gout crystals and other inflammatory conditions. x-rays may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine sacroiliac joints and/or joints of the hands. typical x-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis. the blood test for the genetic marker hla-b27 mentioned above is often performed. this marker can be found in over 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation."

    "Answer": "since you have employer coverage it is up to your employer what plans are being offered. it is true however that in most states there are one or two dominant insurers in both the individual and small employer market. one of the goals of the aca is to try to increase the number of options available for people who shop through the marketplace. unfortunately that goal was not reached in all areas at least for 2014."

    "Answer": "yes your girlfriend can get pregnant from precum. that's why you always use a condom. in this case your girlfriend is probably not pregnant because she took the plan b pill in timely fashion and precum also has lower concentrations of semen than regular ejaculation. if you're going to have unprotected sex be sure to always use some sort of birth control."

    "Answer": "if you're concerned about having surgery why not get a second opinion? doctors don't take it personally when patients do that. and it might give you peace of mind to hear another doctor's take on your situation. your doctor can explain better than anyone what it means that your spleen is swollen (inflamed) and has nodules on it because he or she has seen the films (such as the results of an ultrasound exam ct scan or mri) and lab results. i'd suggest you schedule another appointment and take a written list of questions. your doctor will be happy to explain exactly what's going on and why he or she wants to remove your spleen (an operation that is called \" splenectomy \"). people can live normal lives without a spleen. ask you doctor about possible complications from the surgery. it should not \"slow you down \" though it's true people without a spleen are somewhat more susceptible to develop infections like the flu. your doctor can explain what it will be like to live without a spleen. best of luck to you!"

    "Question": "what is the treatment for a fever?",
    "Answer": "generally if the fever does not cause discomfort the fever itself need not be treated. it is not necessary to awaken an adult or child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by your health-care practitioner. the following fever-reducing medications may be used at home: acetaminophen (tylenol and others) can be used to lower a fever. the recommended pediatric dose can be suggested by the child's health-care provider. adults without liver disease or other health problems can take 1 000 mg (two \"extra strength\" tablets) every four to six hours or as directed by your physician. ibuprofen (motrin/advil) can also be used to break a fever in patients over 6 months of age. discuss the best dose with your doctor. for adults 400-600 mg (two to three 200 mg tablets) can be used every six hours. aspirin should not be used for fever in children or adolescents. aspirin use in children and adolescents during a viral illness (especially chickenpox and influenza or flu) has been associated with reye syndrome. reye syndrome is a dangerous illness which causes prolonged vomiting confusion and even coma and liver failure. an individual with a fever should be kept comfortable and not overdressed. overdressing can cause the temperature to rise further. tepid water (85 f [30 c]) baths are a home remedy that may help bring down a fever. never immerse someone in ice water. this is a common misconception. never sponge a child or an adult with alcohol; the alcohol fumes may be inhaled causing many problems."

absolutely the people who say it can return are right. last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles. many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned. i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors. i was not working outdoors at all! moreover even now a year later though i don't have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return. currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck--unrelated to last year's episode. i have taken prednizone for a week (and never again will i take a stereoid! no wonder all those nfl players are killing people). i have washed all my clothes sheets etc. in hot water twice. the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back. but i have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks. the poison ivy--as someone else said--is surely in my system. i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant wouldn't look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so-called professionals. what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar. it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching. i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally. then i rub \"itch\" all over the now-dry area. there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs (hideous but effective) the scabs fall off fairly soon (so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall! ugh! gross! ). i've been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in--whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep. other \"treatments\"--vick's vapo-rub clorox (so good for your liver) cortizone creams and other over-the-counter meds have not done so well. haven't tried tobacco but i'm an x-smoker and if there's anything that makes me want to smoke it's lying awake all night scratching--so i had to forget that. a pox take the next creep who writes that \"the best treatment is avoidance. \" (i hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once. the plant is everywhere! ) i hope this helps some other poor sufferer! itchy-scratchy yes the rash can return to same area months later. once you have been exposed to this plant and even thought the rash itself may have long since healed or faded away the underlying skin proteins remain sensitized to urushiol for quite some time in some cases several years hence the slightest newest recent exposure to urushiol in certain individuals will cause you to experience for a second or third time a newer rash. breathing in the flower pollen also in certain individuals will cause them to develop a rash. exposure frequency and time interval duration between each successive pi exposure to a large extent will determine how severe your rash outbreak will not only be but how long it will last. \"it's in the blood\" is what i have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you. always thought that statement was crazy until 6 years ago i accidently got it on me. the rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when i have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly. tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible. usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out. the most horrid plant in the universe! i have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins. now over most of my body. after two 5 day treatments of 12 steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever (during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped). desperate now with itching awful looking skin. have left the gym (which had helped me lose 2 stone in 4 months). hate going as whether you are working out or swimming people quite naturally look at your skin. i am now to see a dermatologist on tuesday so can only hope something can be improved. best cooling lotions i have used for relief of itching have been aloe vera and (one i got in the us) called caladryl clear (topical analgesic skin protectant). coated in this after cold water or ice to skin seems to make me more comfortable. i got this in june and it is now nearly september. worst thing i have ever managed to get. deeply regret doing all that gardening now and still haven't found the pouson ivy."

    "Question": "will be ovulating next week tips? !? . hello i am trying to conceive. i need any tips and the best day to have intercourse. my last period started the 5th and is just about finished. i checked my ovulation calendar and it says my fertile days are the 14th - 20th and i will be ovulating on the 19th. but i checked a different calendar and it says totally different days. does anyone know when i should be about ovulating and when i should have intercourse? please help i'm trying to have a mini me <positive_smiley> <positive_smiley> <positive_smiley>",
    "Answer": "timing is everything. sperm can live for three to five days but the egg is around for only 12 to 24 hours. to increase the likelihood of conception it's important to have daily intercourse in the days leading to ovulation and on the day you ovulate. a woman typically ovulates about 14 days before her next period. if you have a 28-day cycle which is the average then you would ovulate about halfway through your cycle. but if you have a 35-day cycle you would ovulate around day 21 not day 17. (day 1 is the first day of your period. ) you can refer some useful tips to get pregnant fast here. good luck!"

    "Answer": "a salt substitute should not be a problem. remember that salt is an acquired taste so it can take time to \"un-acquire\" it. don't use very much and try to reduce even the substitute over time. you will then. perhaps for the first time that you remember. will be able to taste the true flavor of food unaltered by salt. use other herbs like garlic peppers etc. to flavor your foods and in a few months you will not even want salt. as a matter of fact other foods that you did not prepare will tend to taste too-salty to you."

    "Question": "can being over weight cause arthritis in your feet?",
    "Answer": "while excess weight doesn't necessarily cause arthritis in places like your feet it can exacerbate it or make it progress in a more rapid fashion. excess weight puts additional stress on joints making arthritis symptoms worse. losing weight will not cure arthritis but it can help slow down the progression of the disease. for more details on how this works see this webmd article. weight bearing joints like knee and ankle are most likely affected by arthritis. being overweight is a known risk factor of arthritis and even putting on 10 pounds may worsen the arthritis. while treating arthritis in obese and overweight individuals weight loss is considered as an important strategy."

    "Answer": "the prospect of bed rest may sound like a welcome reprieve from your busy life at first but if it lasts long you can feel isolated frustrated and bored. fortunately there are things you can do to make your days weeks or months of bed rest more pleasant and productive. stay on schedule. days and nights can easily run together if you spend both in bed. make it a point to maintain some type of schedule. get dressed in the morning. keep a to-do list and plan \"activities\" for the day such as calling a few friends scheduling a doctor's appointment or ordering baby items online. read up. catch up on reading -- something you won't likely have time for once the baby comes. good picks include parenting books magazines and web sites; baby name books; newspapers; magazines; novels; or even children's books that you may want to read to your little one later. catch some flicks. enjoy movies on tv online or from services that deliver dvds directly to your home. let people help. although you may find it difficult to ask for help you must. if a friend or family member asks how they may help offer specifics such as picking up items at the grocery store or taking your turn on the car pool until you're up and out again. keep a journal. keep a journal to vent (for your eyes only) or to document your pregnancy (possibly a gift to share with your child one day). better yet keep one of each type. catch up on correspondence. answer letters pay bills write thank-you notes for baby shower gifts or make a list of people (with names and email addresses) to contact when the baby is born. get online support. use the internet to find support from other mothers on bed rest. check out message boards and chat rooms for empathy and advice."

    "Answer": "if you've been on blood pressure medication for two years and the cold feet are a new symptom then it's unlikely your medication is the cause. however any new symptom is a good reason to visit your health care provider and get checked out. low blood pressure can cause cold hands and feet but it's relatively uncommon. more often cold feet are caused by poor circulation. this in turn can be caused by many other things such as diabetes peripheral vascular disease or even raynaud's phenomenon. your best bet is to see your health care provider to discover what's causing your cold feet. after a physical exam your provider might order a few more tests to get to the bottom of this -- and help get your feet warm again!"

    "Question": "what is a brain tumor?",
    "Answer": "a tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue that's formed by an abnormal accumulation of cells. normally the cells in your body age die and are replaced by new cells. with cancer and other tumors something disrupts this cycle. new cells are made when they're not needed and old cells don't die. as this process goes on the tumor continues to grow as more and more cells are added to the mass. primary brain tumors emerge from the various cells that make up the brain and central nervous system and are named for the kind of cell in which they first form. the most common types of adult brain tumors are gliomas or astrocytic tumors. these tumors form from astrocytes and other types of glial cells which are cells that help keep nerves healthy. the second most common types of adult brain tumors are meningeal tumors. these form in the meninges the thin layer of tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord and can grow from a number of different kinds of brain and spinal cord cells."

    "Answer": "this is an issue that only your urologist can (or should answer). anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources: the urine or the bowels. since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another ct scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain. even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist. if you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate. they will most likely order an immediate ct scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms. i have \"been there and done that\" (stent and all) so my heart goes out to you. it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last 3 \" in my ureter. when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out. is this normal during the passing process?"

    "Answer": "at first the surgical insertion of the t-tube creates quite a bit of inflammation. this can cause tinnitus or changes in your hearing. over time this is supposed to settle down and those symptoms should resolve. it has not been a month since your surgery so things may still improve in the next month or so. tinnitus is not a pleasant symptom to tolerate (i have it too) and your hearing can actually be a bit more sensitive as you have demonstrated on your hearing test. of course this is of little consolation. your hearing loss may fluctuate so when you saw the ent it may have been a good day. if the tube was clogged your hearing would have been a bit muffled. if you can wait it out a bit longer perhaps another month you may begin to experience gradual improvement or at least you will become more accustomed to those aberrant symptoms. either way it should get better for you. make sure to follow up with your ent again if it does not. i disagree that these symptoms are \"in your head\"."

    "Question": "can i take benadryl with zyrtec. my wife has hives on her chest and arms that just poped up last night.",
    "Answer": "benadryl is very effective for hives because of the fast onset of the medication but only lasts about four hours. zyrtec tends to be slower in onset but lasts longer (24 hours). both are antihistamines of course and most of the time you only need one of the other. on some occasions however when you have taken zyrtec in the 24 hours you can still get hives so it is safe to take a dose of benadryl. benadryl does cause sedation so please be careful if you need to drive. if the hives don't clear up fairly quickly or if they're accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention. these can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something -- food medication etc. if your wife gets hives occasionally (as some people do) and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then i'd suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives. there are medications other than benadryl that are used to treat hives. in terms of combining antihistamines i'd suggest you speak to a pharmacist. while benadryl (diphenhydramine) has a different chemical composition than zyrtec (cetirizine) they still are both the same class of medication. generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician. i hope that gives you some clarity. why would you want to take two antihistamines. you may want to talk to a doctor and get a stronger prescription antihistamine if either of these are not very effective for you."

    "Answer": "i had twins and i knew very early on but my doctor assured me that i was not. i did have twins but we didnt learn this till the 5th month. the fetal protein count was too high for a normal pregnancy. it was then that i confirmed my suspisions. i could not tell i was carrying two babies though till the 7th month. then you know you have activity constantly. and i went to term with them. so just because you have \"moving around\" doesnt mean twins. you will know what that seems to feel like when your in your last trimester."

    "Answer": "chronic health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. be sure to get these conditions under control before you become pregnant since they pose risks to both you and your baby. careful medical monitoring begun before conception and continued throughout your pregnancy can reduce the risks associated with these conditions. high blood pressure and diabetes can develop for the first time during pregnancy and women over the age of 30 are at increased risk. if you are pregnant and over age 35 this makes it especially important that you get early and regular prenatal care to ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment. stillbirth (delivery of a baby that has died before birth) is more common in women over age 35. older women are also more likely to have low-birth weight babies (weighing less than 5. 5 pounds at birth). cesarean birth is also slightly more common for women having their first child after age 35."

    "Answer": "your doctor may suggest medications to reduce inflammation ease pain and control your shingles infection. painkillers such as aspirin or acetaminophen can relieve mild pain. anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (motrin) or naproxen (aleve) are also often helpful for pain. antiviral drugs such as acyclovir may help stop progression of the rash especially if used early in the course of the blister breakout. similar drugs such as valtrex or famvir can also be used. these drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. benzoin available over the counter may protect irritated skin when applied to unbroken lesions. antibiotics can keep the infection under control if the area becomes infected by bacteria. tricyclic antidepressants or seizure medication may be prescribed for the pain that lingers after lesions have healed. antidepressants may also help with depression that can occur with the onset of shingles or as a result of the lingering pain. steroids to reduce inflammation and postherpetic neuralgia are considered controversial."

    "Answer": "lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues as though they were foreign substances. lupus is not contagious. no one knows exactly what causes the body to attack its own tissues. a person may be born with a certain genetic makeup that affects how the immune system functions or makes him or her at risk for lupus. a combination of factors can trigger the autoimmune process some of which may affect one person but not another. 1 exposure to ultraviolet light usually from sunlight is known to trigger the disease process and symptom flares. hormonal factors are linked to autoimmune disease though the link is poorly understood. some research shows an increased risk of lupus with higher levels of estrogen. but a separate study did not find evidence that the hormones estrogen or prolactin taken for hormone replacement therapy or birth control or taken previously for fertility treatments increased the risk of lupus. 2 another study showed that women with stable lupus had no increased risk of symptom flares from taking birth control pills. 3 smoking may increase the risk of getting lupus and may make the disease more severe. some medications are suspected triggers of lupus and symptom flares. some infections are suspected triggers. some people who have cytomegalovirus (cmv) parvovirus (such as fifth disease ) and hepatitis c infections eventually develop lupus. the epstein-barr virus has been linked to lupus in children. chemical exposure has been known to trigger lupus. suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica dust. hair dyes and straighteners linked to lupus in the past are no longer considered to be lupus triggers. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "if vomiting was the only definitive symptom of pregnancy people with stomach flu would be freaking out. morning sickness is only one of many symptoms that could indicate pregnancy in a woman who is sexually-involved and not using any form of contraception. there are other medical conditions that can cause vomiting as well so see your medical provider. you can always take a pregnancy test to be sure or if you do not want to be pregnant use an effective contraceptive so you would no have to worry."

    "Question": "my skin is breaking out all of a sudden? about 8 weeks ago i had clear looking skin but now i am getting acne. about 8 weeks ago i didn't really get acne and i haven't really changed my skin regimen much. the only thing i have added to my skin regimen is the kate somerville eradikate acne spot treatment which contains 10% of sulfur. i don't think this is what has been causing my acne since i was having acne before i bought this treatment thus why i bought it. i use clean sheets wash my face twice a day use exfoliator 2 a week use a face mask cleansers spot treatment. but i don't know what else to do",
    "Answer": "sometimes hitting the outer skin is half the battle. i used to have really bad acne when i was younger and they prescribed me a lot of creams that never worked. i heavily researched online and noticed how a diet plays a significant role in oily skin that results in breakouts. i decided to do a research study of my own and it involved a two week diet of using olive oil grease and other fatty foods. then the next two weeks i ate more vegetables (especially a & c) and also took 50 mg of zinc and cut the saturated fats within 40g and consumed 0 trans fats. the first two weeks i experienced break outs that only seemed to keep getting worse and worse. then the after the first week of eating healthier i noticed a halt and no new acne had sprung up or anything and most of my breakouts began to go away. at the end of the second week my skin had just about cleared up which was expected due to the vitamin a c and zinc helping reduce oily skin. in reality dermatology is a scam when many home remedies can be found in your home. hope this helps"

    "Answer": "you know hysterectomies were done almost on every woman back twenty years ago it was like oh you need a hysterectomy. today i look at a hysterectomy done when a patient has severe bleeding from fibroids that cannot be controlled in any other way. she’s tried medication she’s tried birth control pills she’s tried possibly even ablation or a d&c. she’s bleeding she’s anemic the fibroids are the cause she may need a hysterectomy. someone who has enlarging fibroids they are just getting bigger and bigger. there is embolization which could decrease your fibroids by 60% however some women do not respond to it or they are not wanting to do an embolization and they may need a hysterectomy. and of course women that have uterine cancer or have some other form of ovarian cancer possibly may even need a hysterectomy. but i think that birth control pills sometimes can be used instead to control abnormal bleeding. there are other options out there first. i think it should be your last resort."

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of high blood pressure?",
    "Answer": "uncomplicated high blood pressure usually occurs without any symptoms (silently) and so hypertension has been labeled \"the silent killer. \" it is called this because the disease can progress to finally develop any one or more of the several potentially fatal complications of hypertension such as heart attacks or strokes. uncomplicated hypertension may be present and remain unnoticed for many years or even decades. this happens when there are no symptoms and those affected fail to undergo periodic blood pressure screening. some people with uncomplicated hypertension however may experience symptoms such as headache dizziness shortness of breath and blurred vision. the presence of symptoms can be a good thing in that they can prompt people to consult a doctor for treatment and make them more compliant in taking their medications. often however a person's first contact with a physician may be after significant damage to the end-organs has occurred. in many cases a person visits or is brought to the doctor or an emergency room with a heart attack stroke kidney failure or impaired vision (due to damage to the back part of the retina). greater public awareness and frequent blood pressure screening may help to identify patients with undiagnosed high blood pressure before significant complications have developed. about one out of every 100 (1%) people with hypertension is diagnosed with severe high blood pressure (accelerated or malignant hypertension) at their first visit to the doctor. in these patients the diastolic blood pressure (the minimum pressure) exceeds 140 mm hg! affected persons often experience severe headache nausea visual symptoms dizziness and sometimes kidney failure. malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to prevent a stroke (brain damage)."

    "Question": "if i am at high risk for colon cancer but not yet 50 why won't doctors bill a colonoscopy as routine? . my brother-in-law was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at 46 years old. he died last september. . my husband is 48 and wants to get a colonoscopy but the procedure is not being billed as \"routine\" so we would have to meet our entire deductible before insurance pays anything. . what are our options?",
    "Answer": "push the insurance company. do not take \"no\" as the first answer and ask to talk to the medical director or better yet have your physician request an exemption to the rule. a friend of mine wanted a colonoscopy early because her grandmother had colon cancer. they refused at first only offering a sigmoidoscopy (a cheaper and less- thorough exam). they finally okayed the colonoscopy and a pre-cancerous lesion was found in a place where the sigmoidoscopy would not have discovered. had she waited several more years like the insurance company wanted she would have definitely had colon cancer by that time. fight 'em!"

    "Answer": "treating someone in their early 20s would not be a problem for an orthodontist. the goal for orthodontics is to straighten teeth in order to make them easier to clean and to make them function in the ways that they’re supposed to. teeth function better when they are straight up and down and not at an angle. it sounds to me like your dentist has only your best intentions in mind."

    "Answer": "in my opinion everyone should know their hiv status. whether you've only had one partner or many partners the safest bet is to get a simple hiv blood test so you know for sure you're hiv-free. the reason i say this is because hiv is not spread only through sex. other risky behaviors such as sharing needles to inject illicit drugs can spread hiv. so can getting a tattoo or piercing with a dirty needle. so don't be ashamed to get an hiv test. then you'll know for sure and set your mind at ease. take care!"

    "Question": "is wearing cheap sunglasses better than no sunglasses if my child and i will be out in the sun for an extended period?",
    "Answer": "the price of the sunglasses does not guarantee the amount of uv protection. more importantly if you are wearing sunglasses that are darkly tinted yet do not offer much uv protection the back of your eyes will be exposed to more uv light not less. this is because the tinted lenses will encourage your pupils to dilate (enlarge) which will then allow more uv light to reach the back of your eye. although this uv exposure may not take its toll immediately increased uv exposure has clearly been linked to many forms of eye disease that may not show up for decades. age-related macular degeneration and cataracts are just two forms of delayed eye disease that good (not necessarily expensive) eyeglasses can help prevent."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer the classic instructions for taking thyroid hormone have always been to take it on an empty stomach and not to eat for an hour after taking it. what's more important i think is to take your thyroid medication in a consistent manner. in other words if you have to take it with food every day be sure to take it with food every day. don't take it with food one day and then take it on an empty stomach the next day. consistency in your regimen will yield the best results. more importantly when you do your annual (or whenever) thyroid labs the results will reflect how much thyroid you're actually getting on your chosen regimen. i would say if it's possible for you to take your thyroid medication first thing in the morning on an empty stomach that's probably your best bet for making sure you get the maximum uptake from each dose. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "you can usually treat athlete's foot (tinea pedis) yourself at home by using nonprescription medicines and taking care of your feet. but if you have diabetes and develop athlete's foot or have persistent severe or recurrent infections see your doctor. nonprescription medicines nonprescription antifungals include terbinafine ( lamisil at) miconazole ( micatin ) clotrimazole ( lotrimin af) and tolnaftate ( tinactin ). these medicines are creams lotions solutions gels sprays ointments swabs or powders that are applied to the skin (topical medicine). treatment will last from 1 to 6 weeks. if you have a vesicular (blister) infection soak your foot in burow's solution several times a day for 3 or more days until the blister fluid is gone. after the fluid is gone use an antifungal cream as directed. you can also apply compresses using burow's solution. to prevent athlete's foot from returning use the full course of all medicine as directed even after symptoms have gone away. avoid using hydrocortisone cream on a fungal infection unless your doctor prescribes it. foot care good foot care helps treat and prevent athlete's foot. keep your feet clean and dry. dry between your toes after swimming or bathing. wear leather shoes or sandals that allow your feet to breathe. when indoors wear socks without shoes. wear cotton socks to absorb sweat. change your socks twice a day. (white socks do not prevent athlete's foot as some people believe. ) use talcum or antifungal powder on your feet. allow your shoes to air for at least 24 hours before you wear them again. wear shower sandals in public pools and showers. if you have athlete's foot dry your groin area before your feet after bathing. also put on your socks before your underwear. this can prevent fungi from spreading from your feet to your groin which may cause jock itch. for more information about jock itch see the topic ringworm of the skin. you may choose not to treat athlete's foot if your symptoms don't bother you and you have no health problems that increase your risk of severe foot infection such as diabetes. but an untreated athlete's foot infection causing skin blisters or cracks can lead to severe bacterial infection. also if you don't treat athlete's foot infection you can spread it to other people. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is emphysema?",
    "Answer": "emphysema is a long-term progressive disease of the lung(s) that occurs when the alveolar walls are destroyed along with the capillary blood vessels that run within them. this lessens the total area within the lung where blood and air can come together limiting the potential for oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer. in early emphysema there is associated inflammation of the small airways or bronchioles which limits the amount of air that can flow to the alveoli. in more severe emphysema there is also a loss of elasticity in the alveolar walls that have not been destroyed. when the patient breathes out the alveoli and small airways collapse. this makes it hard for air to get out of the lungs and makes it even harder for new air to enter. as more of the lung is destroyed and the lung cannot maintain oxygen concentrations in the bloodstream the body compensates by gradually increasing the breathing rate. after awhile even hyperventilation (hyper=more + ventilation=breathing) cannot maintain adequate oxygen levels and the arteries in the lung begin to constrict or narrow. the heart has to work harder to push blood into these narrower blood vessels causing the blood pressure in the lung arteries to increase (pulmonary hypertension). over time the extra work requirement causes the heart muscle to enlarge (hypertrophy) and can cause heart failure."

    "Question": "what medications and treatments are available to treat ulcerative colitis?",
    "Answer": "medicines usually are the treatment of choice for ulcerative colitis. they control or prevent inflammation in the intestines and help: relieve symptoms. promote healing of damaged tissues. put the disease into remission and keep it from flaring up again. postpone or prevent the need for surgery. medication choices the choice of medicine usually depends on the severity of the disease the part of the colon affected and whether complications are present. treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis often begins with aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine). aminosalicylates relieve inflammation in the intestines and help the disease go into remission. they may also keep the disease from becoming active again. corticosteroids may be added if symptoms continue. corticosteroids relieve inflammation in the intestines. for severe cases stronger treatment with medicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine [aza] 6-mercaptopurine [6-mp] or cyclosporine ) infliximab ( remicade ) and intravenous (iv) corticosteroids may be needed. if you are pregnant talk to your doctor about which medicines are safe for you to take. usually aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are safe especially when your doctor thinks that ulcerative colitis is more dangerous to the fetus than these medicines. ask your doctor whether you can take medicines that suppress the immune system. these are used only when the benefit outweighs the potential harm to the fetus. a doctor can recommend medicines based on the stage of the pregnancy and the severity of your symptoms. several studies have shown that the nicotine patch may help treat active ulcerative colitis. it is not yet known how long the benefits of the nicotine patch last or if the patch can help prevent flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. if the patch works it most likely benefits people whose symptoms began or became worse after quitting smoking. but due to the addictive power and other harmful effects of nicotine most doctors still prefer to use traditional medicines to treat ulcerative colitis before trying the nicotine patch. what to think about aminosalicylates are the most common medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis. most of the time these medicines are all a person needs to keep the disease in remission (a period of time with no symptoms). when aminosalicylates do not work corticosteroids are most often the next medicine tried. corticosteroids will only be used long enough to stop the inflammation in your colon. after the inflammation goes down aminosalicylates will most likely be used to maintain remission. if aminosalicylates are not strong enough to keep you in remission or if corticosteroids don't work your doctor may have you try different medicines. these medicines include immunomodulators cyclosporine and infliximab. all of these medicines control the immune response in your body and will decrease the amount of inflammation in your intestine. the inflammation is what causes the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're having pain problems with your hips. it sounds very unpleasant! to answer your question most infections in the body cause fever. in fact fever often is the first sign of an infection brewing somewhere. other signs and symptoms of infection anywhere in the body include an elevated white blood cell (wbc) count localized pain and foul-smelling drainage -- among other things. the bursae (plural of bursa) are leathery sacs located near the joints. these sacs produce fluid to lubricate the joints. an infected bursa probably would be diagnosed via aspiration in which a small needle is inserted into the bursa sac and fluid withdrawn. this fluid can be cultured to determine if it contains infection-causing bacteria. it's important to note that bursitis is not an infection per se. the suffix \"-itis\" means \"inflamed. \" thus \"bursitis\" simply means an inflamed bursa not necessarily an infected one. many things can cause a hip bursa to become inflamed including trauma (falling and tearing or injuring the bursa sac) and chronic irritation (such as sleeping on your side). bursitis can be difficult to cure. if you have reason to believe one of your hip bursae is infected please discuss your concerns with your pain management doctor. he can best address this issue and take appropriate steps. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "first time taking perscribed xanax 0. 5 will show how long in your blood stream?",
    "Answer": "this is a repeat of answer give by webmd health expert dr hoffman. i think this will answer your question. \"alprazolam (xanax) is an anxiety-relieving medicine that starts to work within about an hour after taking the pill. the level of drug reaches a peak in the bloodstream after one to two hours and its felt effects last on average about 5 hours. however xanax remains in the bloodstream long after its anti-anxiety effects have worn off. xanax’s average half-life is 11 hours. this means that it takes an average of 11 hours for the body to eliminate half the xanax dose. in older or obese people or those with liver disease xanax’s half-life is longer as long as 40 hours. it takes several half-lives to eliminate a drug completely. so for most people there may still be a small fraction of xanax in your blood two days or more after taking a single pill. people who take xanax on a regular basis maintain a higher drug level in the bloodstream and it could take several weeks to eliminate all the xanax from the body. xanax is excreted from the blood into the urine and is detectable in drug tests. different drug tests have different sensitivities and may or may not detect a low level of xanax in the urine. \" what does. 05 look like"

    "Answer": "if you are taking a drug not specifically prescribed for you then the first process of elimination is for you to eliminate doing this. how long a drug is detected depends on many factors: the method of analysis used (something i do not know in your case) the extent of your drug use and your body's ability to metabolize this particular substance. i can't offer you any tricks or inside information on how to pass your random drug test. it is what it is."

    "Question": "what can i do to help my 9 year old son who falls aleep easily but then wakes up several times a night?",
    "Answer": "insomnia in children is quite common. it can become very problematic for parents as this disturbs their sleep as well. often the children do not seem too bothered by their insomnia. there can be many causes for this type of insomnia. use of caffeine refined sugars and heavy meals particularly at night can cause this problem. another common reason for insomnia in kids is sleep association disorder. in this disorder children learn to fall asleep with a particular object or activity (such as rocking or patting). when they wake up periodically at night (as all of us do normally) they are unable to fall back asleep until they again have the same object or activity. sleep apnea can also occur in children and can cause insomnia. these are only a few of the reasons a child can have sleep maintenance insomnia. i would suggest talking first with your pediatrician. often it is a problem that they can easily address. if not they may recommend further consultation depending on what they think is going on."

    "Answer": "so sorry your daughter is going through this. it must be miserable for her. i would suggest taking her to her pediatrician to rule out any physical cause for this vomiting. if she checks out ok physically then i would question whether she may be suffering from anxiety. anxiety in school children is not uncommon. and anxiety about going to school definitely could cause a child to vomit. you might talk with your daughter to see if she's being bullied or if she is nervous about school. if anxiety is the problem just talking may give her relief. you also might talk to the school counselor. this can be a good starting point. wishing you and your daughter all the best!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your mom is going through this. it sounds like a very uncomfortable situation. if it's been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer. the symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus. you may need to take a \"watchful waiting\" approach to see if the situation gets better or worse. if it gets better then great! if it gets worse i'd suggest a return trip to the doctor. keep in mind i'm just making suggestions. i am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice. hope your mom feels better soon! hi to both of you and i too am concerned about my wife debra who is type 2 seven rods in her back dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing. you have to look at everything. i tell my wife debra to invesigate everything and find out what works for her and her doctor said too that everything was fine. i told her to research her metformin and she decreased it by 1000mg a day. guess what she has never felt better all because she has been losing weight. everybody needs to adjust things in this life. we also need to look at other things and it may be or not the problem like weather flu colds nurtition. try theses immune boasting foods- elderberry button mushrooms acai berry oysters watermelon cabbage almonds grapefruit wheat germ low fat yogurt garlic spinach green&black tea sweet potato and broccoli and my favorite beets. my wife just said it could be stress and or associated the nerves so the b-vitimins would be area to start. i have to go bye steve & debra tell her to goto another doctor those are also symptoms of a heart attack. don't want to cause undue worry but i had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack. since she is diabetic you have to rule out hypoglycemic headace get a grbs tested if grbs is less than 60 mg ask her to take some sugar or candy. treatment for gastritis can also be given. a neck xray can rule out cervical spondilitis 0 0 0 i have a very similar problem. it seems to be a side effect of taking insulin. it starts with a tightness and pain in the back of my neck and then progresses into a headache. it becomes nearly unbearable. i have stopped taking the novolog and within 24 hours or so it goes away. i also get extreme weakness shakiness and extreme pain in my spine. this is not a listed side effect. my doctors have not heard of this side effect nor do they know what could be causing it. the only thing i have found is that people with ms and type 1 (i have not been diagnosed with ms and i have type 2) sometimes get neck pain but it did not explain why. i’m not sure my doctors actually believe this is happening. i also had the same experience when taking humolog lantus and levemir. by the way the lantus and levemir increased my blood sugar levels. i have sensitivity to many medications and often get the opposite effects from what is expected. i cannot function from these side effects and i am concerned about not taking the medication. i also experience nausea. has your mother experienced anything like this?"

    "Question": "is it normal to break out in a very itchy rash all over my arms legs and abdomen after i work out?",
    "Answer": "not that your experience is normal but it is more common than you think. the first thing to do is check any new clothing detergent or soap that you use. these products can cause allergic-type reactions in some people. if you rule out detergent soap or any other lotions then you should consider a possible allergic reaction during exercise due to the release of histamines. it's not that you are allergic to exercise but rather that you may be experiencing a biological response during or after you work out that mimics an allergic reaction. here's what could be happening and why. during exercise histamines are released. histamines are proteins involved in autoimmune responses like an allergic reaction to pollen or dust. people who are sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise just like you are describing. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but they can appear on the neck or arms too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (for example antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. the problem typically occurs more in cold weather than warm. if the problem bothers you so much that you can't stand it or it's not resolving on its own then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine like benadryl 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter antihistamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedating antihistamine. you should not take over-the-counter or prescription medications for this problem without speaking with your doctor."

    "Question": "can vitiligo be cured? what causes it? how can i disguise it?",
    "Answer": "vitiligo is an autoimmune condition and what that means is that for some reason your own body's immune system decides that the pigment forming cells that give your skin color don't belong to you and they attack it and they tend to do this in a very patchy and predictable way. the first place we start to see vitiligo in most people is around the eyes around the mouth and then on areas of high friction like the hands or even the elbows. so that's what causes it. we know the underlying cause it's not a mystery. there is no cure for it that we know of but there are ways to mask it. there are products like dermablend that you can put on and you can match your own natural skin color to try to conceal it. there are some treatments that we try as dermatologists to help with it. sometimes using a product called a psoralen which can be either by mouth or topical. applied to the skin you let it incubate for a little while and then go under ultraviolet light in a light box can stimulate those pigment forming cells to come back to life and suppress the immune system in the skin in those areas to try to help the pigment come back. sometimes this works sometimes it doesn't. when the vitiligo is extensive enough that it covers more of the body than not so if it's very patchy if there is a big contrast in skin color we can use a topical cream called benoquin to try to eliminate all the pigment forming cells. and take away all the pigments. so sometimes we try to bring the pigment back and sometimes we try to take it all away. but in the meantime trying to cover it may be the best thing. in rare cases it just fades out on its own. i use low dose naltrexone for my autoimmune illness and belong to a group in face book about ldn so i say research ldn for vitiligo. many sites on google> about it good luck there is also a skin dye called dy-o-derm that you can use to dye small spots. this works better for people who have more olive colored skintones. i ordered it off the internet. i understand a lot of weight lifters use it as 'tan' for their skin. it contains acetone and my skin kind of objected to it after using it for a long time. we have nearly finished our supply of dy-o-derm which we found to be a very effective stain for small exposed areas of skin (e. g. hands) and less messy/ longer lasting than the camouflage creams we use for larger areas. unfortunately it was taken off the market several months ago and is no longer available as you will see if you try to order it from amazon. i believe there were some concerns about the chemical content of dy-o-derm but there seems to be no other product like it. please let us know if you find one."

    "Answer": "this issue has come up many times on webmd's ear nose and throat community and there is a few things you can try. you are correct. the weight of your head on your pillow is either restricting circulation to your outer ear (pinna) or you are causing some nerve compression. you can adjust your sleeping position to avoid this over-compression but old habits are hard to break. an ent colleague suggested that you get a foam pillow and cut out an ear-sized crater in it. this way your ear can rest in a little bed of it's own without causing undo compression. it may work but this is not something you can buy. you will need to make it. the worst that can happen is that it will not help . you can try softer pillows or pillows of different shapes as well. some people will sleep on the other side of the bed so they will tend to turn their head a different way. even if you slept with your wrist flexed under the pillow you could wake up with a numb tingling hand so the the only answer to this problem is either changing your sleep position or creating that special pillow."

    "Question": "when should i take a pregnancy test? i had sex 2 days after getting off of my period. used condom but want to be sure.",
    "Answer": "good for you for practicing safe sex. condoms are good not only for pregnancy prevention but for reducing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. you should be able to test within a day or two of your next missed period. in other words you'll have to wait to see if your next scheduled period is late. if it is you can test a day or two after it was due. each home pregnancy test is different so read the box to see when it says to test. best wishes to you!"

    "Question": "can i get an std through urine contacting an open wound? . i was helping clean out a friends car and grabbed a sticky bottle of muscle milk. i went to rinse off my hand with what i thought was water but turned out to be sour urine. i had a cut on my hand from a few days before. is it possible for me to contract and sti or any other form of disease this way?",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer i never heard of a case where an std was contracted from a bottle of old urine. i think you are safe even if you recently had an open wound on your hand. needless to say i assume that you wash your hands thoroughly after this exposure. as long as you are not showing any signs of a skin infection around this wound you are in the clear. urine is typically sterile (unless the person has a urinary tract infection) but i still would not want to have this old pee on my hands. you are wise to be concerned but it would not be likely you can catch any disease from this exposure. even if you did get a minor wound infection it would not be an std."

    "Answer": "congratulations my sister was 15 with her first 17 her second and 20 her third she will be young with them and understand them more have more energy and in 15 years she will only be in her early 30s and her life will be hers plusyou she will have three friends by her side. she went to a school for pregnant girls then college to study childcare and is now at uni and working part time as a teaching assistant where the girls get a free place so she did it and is having a ball so you can too! i used to laugh when people would watch her with the babies and see how young she was and shake their heads at her she used to just laugh at them for being so blind to how happy and clean they was. you are only young although your a mummy your still not full adult your still developing so the hospital will most likely keep an extra close eye you with e few extra scans but no reason your baby wont be healthy. do you have any young mother groups near you? maybe try an aquanatal class you will need a support network because sometimes you will need a rest. you need to go and get your pregnancy vitamins from the doctor and a dating scan so you know where you are with it all. yoga walking swimming all good for you and bump. limit your tuna intake to once a week as mercury can build up in babies water no salad from salad bars as its easy to catch listeria no unpasturised or blue cheeses at least one but more if you can of dairy eggs milk yogurt. five mixed fruit or veg each day for vitamins and minerals for babies bones and eyes and skin. lean beef cooked well and chicken grilled fresh fish or soups if you dont like veg to get your nutrients. swap normal potatoes for sweet potatoes and white rice and pasta for brown or wholemeal same for bread pulse foods like chick peas in hummous are good for energy pumpkin seeds on cereal of toasted pine nuts on salad are great for a good immune system. drink plenty of water and get as much sleep as you can. ginger is good for sickness as is fresh pineapple it has trypsinogen in which helps the tummy. water milk fresh meat for protein and your low carbs for energy and fiber needs. no smoking no drugs obviously alcohol in very small amounts and a nice treat once a week of whatever food/cake/sweet craving takes your fancy. if you need a c section you will need help looking after your little one for a few weeks as you wont be able to do any heavy lifting just the newborn thats it. take a bit of time each day and put your feet up and relax. remember when you het stressed the hormones in your brain go to the baby too so happy baby is a happy mummy. big hugs and good luck xxx"

    "Answer": "there are \"natural ways\" of contraception like the rhythm method or coitus interruptus (pulling out before ejaculation) but most people who practice these less-than-perfect methods end up being parents. non-vaginal sex like oral sex mutual masturbation etc. is effective but perhaps not enjoyable as good ol' fashioned intercourse. you can use a diaphragm or a cervical cap. basically you both need to see a good gynecologist or visit planned parenthood for a consultation. birth control pills when properly prescribed are safe. the do not have \"high risks of side effects\" like you believe. there are few natural ways of preventing pregnancy since getting pregnant is really the natural way. humans are designed to conceive; not to prevent pregnancy."

    "Answer": "the ent did not likely cause your tinnitus but that wisdom tooth certainly can do it but a wisdom tooth problem would not be likely to cause your vertigo. temporary tinnitus can be caused by inflammation of the eardrum from the wax impaction however. vertigo and tinnitus are often inner ear problems. an area that cannot be seen by the ent during an exam. cleaning out your ear canal would not get anywhere near the inner ear. many inner ear problems are viral and will resolve on their own in several weeks but there are some innear ear conditions that can last longer. much longer."

    "Answer": "hi: i think i'm in the same boat as you. i'm the most active healthiest person i currently know but i am also the most overweight too (220 pounds but a size 12-14). i eat a very healthy diet. gluten-free no junk food lots of fish no dairy. no added sugars. lots of fresh fruits and veggies. i drink 1 to 2 litres of water a day. i keep my calorie count to between 1200 to 1500 a day. i try to get 7 hours of sleep every night. i supplement my nutrition with b12 complex vitamins an iron supplment a raw multivitamin amino acid supplement msm and chondroitin joint supplements and omega 3 supplements. i workout like it's my part time job. i try to run 4 days a week for at least 4 to 5 miles. i walk my dog every day for at least 3 miles. i do weight training 3 times a week with a personal trainer. i do muay thai kickboxing on saturdays for an hour and a half and kung fu on tuesdays and thursdays for two hours each. sounds like a lot right? what can i say? i enjoy it. even with all of that i struggle to lose the weight. i am lucky if i drop one to two pounds a week. for most two pounds a week is great but they don't exert themselves half as much as i do. i just don't get it. i got my thyroids checked and it all came back normal. my brother and i are the two most obese ones in our family. everyone else didn't grow up fat (8 kids in all). i wonder if it does have something to do with genetics. it's so frustrating. it's taken me 3 years to lose about 100 pounds and then wham! in a matter of 8 months i gained back 40 pounds. i was still exercising regularly although not at the same intensity level (did just karate twice a week and cardio kickboxing 5 times a week) and i only slightly laxed on my clean eating habits and boom! 40 pounds. i didn't eat junk food just went to \"regular\" food and the pounds piled back on so quickly. so frustrated."

    "Answer": "i understand how frustrating it can be to try different diets only to not lose weight or gain it all back. it's important to remember you are not alone and most people have difficulty losing weight and keeping it off. in fact a major review found that two thirds of people who diet not only gain their weight back but gain even more weight than when they started the diet. i'm not sure what your health is like or how much you need to lose but you might want to consider a different approach. one that doesn't focus so much on weight (here's why). the problem with diets is that they don't get at the root cause of someone's eating. you might want to consider working with a registered dietitian who focuses on eating issues and a more intuitive/mindful eating approach. the key is to develop a healthy lifestyle you enjoy that helps you lose gradual weight instead of an unrealistic diet that is hard to maintain. you can find a dietitian near you by going to eatright. org. if you are worried about a medical condition by all means get a physical and check your thyroid and discuss your health status with a healthcare provider. good luck!"

    "Answer": "now don't tell you mother or grandmother but the answer is no. going from a warm work-out area to the cold air is not going to cause illness so you can stop worrying about being sued. it is an old and medically-disproven belief that cold air drafts or chills lead to illness. if that were true think of all the aleuts laplanders and siberians. you would think they would be sick all of the time. as a matter of fact many are healthier. the finish and swedes even bake themselves in a sauna and then run out and roll in the snow or jump in an ice lake. crazy? maybe but the practice is harmless. they feel that it is is healthy. maybe they are correct. as a wrestling coach your contaminated mats are much more of a health hazard so before those boys head for the locker room make them disinfect those mats and make them take their work-out clothes home to be properly washed."

    "Question": "are gastroenterologist allowed to perform vaginal exams on a patient who complains about abdominal pain?",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer a gastroenterologist is a licensed and highly-trained physician. many were primary care clinicians before they specialized. while a vaginal exam may not be integral part of his/her practice finding the underlying reason for undiagnosed abdominal pain may require more than just a short trip up the colon or down the throat to the stomach. pelvic causes for abdominal pain are really high on the list so this clinician is most likely being very thorough. they are definitely allowed to do this exam if there is a justifiable reason to do so. now if your podiatrist or a chiropractor wanted to do a vaginal exam i would call that highly-suspicious."

    "Question": "what are the risks of long term use of hormone replacement therapy?",
    "Answer": "the main concern with prolonged ht is an increased risk of breast cancer. the risk seems to be greater in women taking combined therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen) than in women taking estrogen alone. and it may be that starting ht right away after menopause is also associated with greater risk. the good news is that the risk returns to baseline within several years after stopping ht. you should also be aware that combined ht can make it more difficult to read your mammogram (both while you're taking hormones and in the first years after stopping). as a result you might be called back for additional views or biopsy of suspicious areas. right now most experts recommend limiting ht to several years. the nams 2010 ht position statement ( www. menopause. org/psht10. pdf ) suggests that longer use is acceptable for a woman if she believes that the benefits outweigh the risks (especially if she's had trouble stopping therapy). the other condition includes women with low bone mass or osteoporosis who cannot tolerate osteoporosis drugs. the one exception to limiting ht to a few years is the woman who has had premature menopause either because of natural failure of her ovaries or surgical removal. in that case most experts are comfortable advising you to continue ht at least until the age of natural menopause about age 50 at which time you can reassess. if you've been taking hormones for a very long time you might want to start by discussing a lower dose. many clinicians now prescribe half the dose we used to use."

    "Question": "how can stevia help with diabetes?",
    "Answer": "stevia is a natural sugar substitute that belongs in your “diabetes reversal” bag of tricks. [many] medical problems [are] fueled by excess sugar including obesity type 2 diabetes heart disease metabolic syndrome and many other weight-related medical problems. i believe stevia can be a significant part of the solution for many individuals. the key advantage of stevia (over artificial sweeteners) is that it is all natural – it comes from the “sweetleaf” plant that grows primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of western north america to south america. the leaves contain the sweet glycosides stevioside and rebaudioside (discovered in 1931 by french chemists) which are 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). the leaves themselves taste sweet and can be used whole or in ground form in food and beverages. more typically the sweet glycosides are extracted from the plant material and sold as a processed powder. some companies sell stevia liquid resulting from dissolving the powder into a liquid which might also contain additional flavor enhancements. stevia’s taste is on par with other sugar substitutes – sweetness with a mild after-taste. the key to leveraging stevia’s sweetening power is by masking the after-taste which is easy to do. stevia shines when used to enhance the sweetness of foods or beverages that already have some flavor as well as another source of mild sweetness. its use in the popular beverages vitamin water zero and sobe life water demonstrate that it is gaining traction in the united states. it is usually available as powder packets or concentrated liquid in supermarkets natural foods markets vitamin shops and health food stores. its availability and popularity vary from country to country. it is especially popular in japan where it has been in commercial use for nearly 40 years. it is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of asia and in australia and i believe it will become increasingly popular in the united states and europe as well. i use it instead of honey sugar date or splenda in fruit smoothies. without the stevia it tastes bland and cries out for some sweetness. it tastes great with the stevia and there is no after-taste since the fruit masks it. here are two favorite recipes: banana strawberry smoothies 1/2 banana (frozen) 4 strawberries (frozen) 1 cup water 5 drops liquid stevia chocolate peanut butter banana shake 1 banana (frozen chunks) 2 teaspoons natural peanut butter 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 12 ounces water 10 drops stevia my kids and i love these! there is nothing in there i’d hesitate to call healthy. another example: my 4-year old is much happier to drink milk when it has 3 drops of stevia added. if you have kids that will only drink milk if it is sweetened (eg. with chocolate syrup) but you don’t want them consuming so much sugar then stevia drops are your answer. . a 2-ounce bottle of liquid stevia. provides about 250 servings (equivalent to about 500 teaspoons of sugar or over 50 twelve-ounce cans of soda). this saves over 8000 calories with no effect on blood sugar!"

    "Answer": "unprotected intercourse at the time of ovulation can result in pregnancy. this is the most likely time of the month to get pregnant and this time frame is called a 'fertilty window'. after being released through ovulation an egg lives for 12- 24 hours. sperm can survive for three to five days. what this means is that pregnancy is possible with unprotected intercourse even before ovulation. the reason for this? : sperm released during sex 2-3 days prior to ovulation can survive until after ovulation. this can result in fertilization and pregnancy in someone that is sexually active not having a period is one of the most common signs of pregnancy. the simpliest way to determine if she is pregnant is a home pregnancy test which should be confirmed with an office visit and laboratory testing. the only way to know for sure if your girlfriend is pregnant is to have her take a pregnancy test. here is some information on pregnancy tests: <link> here is a few words on the symptoms of pregnancy: <link> take care!"

    "Question": "my appetite has increased suddenly. i have been eating more than i want to but cannot resist and i am gaining weight. i am a 64 year old male. my appetite has increased suddenly. i have been eating more than i want to but cannot resist and i am gaining weight as a result.",
    "Answer": "a good appetite is a sign of good health but if your appetite has suddenly increased in might be a sign of disease. an important distinguishing point is if you are gaining weight. an increase in your weight suggests that your increased appetite might be a response to boredom stress or depression. certain drugs might also explain an increased appetite and weight gain. steroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone which are given for asthma joint and skin problems can cause an increased appetite. certain antidepressants cause an increased appetite and weight gain. increased appetite is a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants; amitriptyline (elavil) imipramine (tofranil) and doxepin (sinequan). increased appetite also occurs with medications used for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; olanzapine (zyprexa) and clozapine (clozaril). some women experience appetite changes right before a period. this is especially true for women with pre-menstrual syndrome who can experience craving for carbohydrates and increased appetite around the time of menstruation. even changes in your diet can affect your appetite. eating a lot of carbohydrates and junk food increases insulin secretion from your pancreas to stabilize your body’s blood sugar and that can make you hungry. if on the other hand your appetite is increased but you are losing weight then diseases that affect your metabolism may be responsible. elevated thyroid levels (grave’s disease or hyperthyroidism) cause an increased appetite because thyroid hormone speeds up your metabolism. diabetes can present with an increased appetite and weight loss. increased exercise can cause your appetite to improve and depending on the calories burned from exercise and your intake your weight may vary. don’t ignore an increased appetite. keep a diary of the foods you are eating and note whether your behavior is affecting your appetite. check your weight and see if you are gaining or losing. see your doctor about a change in appetite to make sure that you do not have a medical condition that needs to be treated. there are many things that can increase appetite -- some beneficial and some not. for example an increase in physical activity may give you a more robust appetite which is fine if you feed your body well. but a lack of sleep or change in eating patterns can also increase appetite which is not so good. think about what has changed in your life both physically and emotionally that could be increasing your appetite. here are some other tips that can help: look not just what you are eating but how. try to sit for meals be mindful of the food enjoy eating an stop when you are comfortably full and satisfied. avoid eaitng on the go or grazng all day which may not satisfy your hunger. too many processed foods can also increase hunger because they aren't very filling or sustaining. eat filling foods including those high in fiber (whole grains fruits vegetables and beans) and protein (lean meats) along with healthy fats (nuts seeds healthy oils). get adequate sleep and physical activity."

    "Question": "what are the types of arrhythmias?",
    "Answer": "the types of arrhythmias include: premature atrial contractions. these are early extra beats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). they are harmless and generally do not require treatment. premature ventricular contractions (pvcs). these are among the most common arrhythmias and occur in people with or without heart disease. this is the skipped heartbeat we all occasionally experience. in some people it can be related to stress too much caffeine or nicotine or too much exercise. but sometimes pvcs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. people who have a lot of pvcs and/or symptoms associated with them should be evaluated by a heart doctor. however in most people pvcs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment. atrial fibrillation. atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally. atrial flutter. this is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. this arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. it often converts to atrial fibrillation. paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt). a rapid heart rate usually with a regular rhythm originating from above the ventricles. psvt begins and ends suddenly. there are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and av nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below). accessory pathway tachycardias. a rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. the impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. this allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly causing the heart to beat unusually fast. av nodal reentrant tachycardia. a rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the av node. it can cause heart palpitations fainting or heart failure. in some cases it can be terminated using simple maneuvers such as breathing in and bearing down. some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm. ventricular tachycardia (v-tach). a rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. the rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood. this can be a serious arrhythmia especially in people with heart disease and may be associated with more symptoms. ventricular fibrillation. an erratic disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. the ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. this is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and defibrillation as soon as possible. long qt syndrome. the qt interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. when the qt interval is longer than normal it increases the risk of a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. long qt syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. it can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs pacemaker electrical cardioversion defibrillation implanted cardioverter/defibrillator or ablation therapy. bradyarrhythmias. these are slow heart rhythms which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block. sinus node dysfunction. a slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal sinus node. significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker. heart block. a delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. the heart may beat irregularly and often more slowly. if serious heart block is treated with a pacemaker."

    "Question": "when to eat after insulin injection? also how much to eat after your insulin injection?",
    "Answer": "the best time to eat after taking insulin depends on three major factors. first the type of insulin you are taking the type of food you are eating and your current blood glucose level. there are two major types of insulin taken before meals rapid acting and short acting. rapid acting insulins include lispro (humalog) insulin aspart (novolog) and insulin glulisine (apidra). it’s generally best to inject these insulins up to 15 minutes before you plan to eat. for the short acting insulins humulin r and novolin r the timing is 30 to 45 minutes prior to the meal. if you wait longer than these times you run the risk of having a low blood glucose level. the type of food also impacts the timing of insulin. carbohydrates have the most effect on glucose levels. meals that are high in fat slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. so eating a pizza which has a lot of fat may not affect your glucose level as quickly as eating a bowl of cereal. protein usually has a small effect on your blood glucose levels. thirdly your blood glucose level prior to eating is important. having a low blood glucose level and then taking insulin and waiting to eat may cause your blood glucose level to drop even further. if your blood glucose level is high before you eat you may need to add extra insulin as recommended by your doctor to compensate for the high blood glucose level. in terms of how much to eat that depends on your weight your dietary needs and your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. this ratio is how many grams of carbohydrates one unit of insulin covers. this is a very individualized number that your doctor will decide when prescribing insulin to you. the important point is to talk with your doctor nurse educator and dietician about the timing of eating and insulin. keep a diary of the different foods you like to eat so that you can gain insight into what happens when you eat that meal. be sure to mark down the grams of carbohydrates in the meal so your doctor can evaluate your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. check your blood glucose level 2 hours after eating to see what effect the meal has on your glucose level. remember that many other factors affect your reaction to insulin such as exercise a cold and stress. diabetes is a chronic disease and the more you understand about the factors affecting you the better your glucose control will become."

    "Question": "what should i look for during a testicular self-exam?",
    "Answer": "there’s the testicle itself which should be like a firm but not hard egg-sized almost thing. the epididymis where the sperms mature and develop the ability to fertilize the egg feels more like an earthworm attached to the bag. and there can be little tiny cysts and nodules that come off of that and lumps and bumps. so it’s essential that when you do a testicular self-exam that you get used to understanding what you’re like. it’s like women with a breast self-exam you learn the lumps and bumps. the guy down there needs to know what’s normal so if there is a change they can say aha this lump wasn’t there last month. men are supposed to do testicular self-exams. they should be doing an exam ideally once a month best in the shower when they’re soapy and wet and that will tell them what their normal baseline is. but our biggest problem in urology is that men are diagnosed with testicular cancers late. they don’t find them early when it’s a little lump or bump they wait until it’s large."

    "Question": "do i really have to exercise 60 minutes a day?",
    "Answer": "the surgeon general recommends that adults do 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity per week and muscle-strengthening activity that works all major muscle groups 2 days per week. the recommendation changes to 75 minutes of aerobic activity if it is vigorous intensity. for weight loss adults are recommended to do 1 hour of exercise per day. simply put you tend to gain greater health benefits by doing more exercise. children are also recommended to do 1 hour of physical activity per day. it sounds like a lot but keep in mind that you can break up your exercise into as little as 10 minute sessions if you need to. do not drastically change your level of physical activity; rather slowly and gradually increase your physical activity until you are meeting the recommendations. also experiment with different types of exercise until you find something that you really enjoy. it also helps to watch tv listen to music or talk with someone while doing certain types of exercise to help pass the time."

    "Answer": "sometimes that can happen if you are low on b vitamins like b 12 and niacin. so before you see your doctor you might want to consider picking up a good sublingual b-complex supplement (much more absorbable than pills) at the pharmacy or grocery store and try that for a few days to see if it helps. they aren't expensive and it won't hurt you if that's not the problem."

    "Question": "why is good post surgical care so important?",
    "Answer": "the care of the surgical patient does not end with the last stitch because success also hinges on the healing what happens afterwards. the service called post operative care is absolutely essential and by the way surgeons who don’t offer continuous post operative care are in violation of one of the basic ethics of the american college of surgeons group for example. it’s called itinerant surgery where you just operate and leave the patient. no you don’t do that. that’s not kosher. for example we’ve seen situations where a patient would have a very extensive face lift the surgeon would put on dressings to exert a little pressure and not see the patient for 3 or 4 days. and then when the patient came in then and only then was it discovered that they had significant bleeding under the skin and the skin was destined to die a very very serious complication. that’s not a conscientious practice. they are not giving good post operative care. you need to see the patient the next day and probably the day after that. you’ve got to make sure in the critical 24 – 48 hours after a 5 to 6 to 7 hour operation that everything is just right. and if there are any signs of any bleeding under the skin it can be dealt with right then and there and prevent the complication. it’s as simple as that. eternal vigilance you’ve got to be on top of it. and if you do the face lift and friday and think that just because it’s the weekend you shouldn’t see the patient until monday you’re not a very conscientious doctor because complications know no holiday."

    "Answer": "individuals with mild and infrequent migraine headaches that do not cause disability may require only over-the-counter (otc) analgesics. individuals who experience several moderate or severe migraine headaches per month or whose headaches do not respond readily to medications should avoid triggers and consider modifications of their lifestyle. lifestyle modifications for migraine sufferers include: go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. exercise regularly (daily if possible). make a commitment to exercise even when traveling or during busy periods at work. exercise can improve the quality of sleep and reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches. build up your exercise level gradually. overexertion especially for someone who is out of shape can lead to migraine headaches. do not skip meals and avoid prolonged fasting. limit stress through regular exercise and relaxation techniques. limit caffeine consumption to less than two caffeine-containing beverages a day. avoid bright or flashing lights and wear sunglasses if sunlight is a trigger. identify and avoid foods that trigger headaches by keeping a headache and food diary. review the diary with your doctor. it is impractical to adopt a diet that avoids all known migraine triggers; however it is reasonable to avoid foods that consistently trigger migraine headaches."

    "Question": "cough and cold only during nightime in winters. is this a known medical condition? . my friend female aged 26 has this weird condition where she gets cough and cold only in the nightime in winters but she stays fine during summers. whenever temperature drops her condition gets worse. she has visited atleast a dozen general physicians. some of them have told her that she is allergic to cold weather. she has tried all sorts of cold and cough medications as prescribed by the doctors but nothing ever helped. so i'm just curious if this \"allergy from cold weather\" is real or not?",
    "Answer": "most humans get colds during the colder weather because people are inside more and viruses are more active and prevalent at that time. this is common for everyone not just you. the cold air temperature does not cause illnesses. there is no such thing as being \"allergic to cold weather\". one can get a runny nose or even a reactive cough from changes in air temperature or humidity but this is not an allergy or an illness. just a normal bodily response. she could be more sensitive to those things but it is definitely not an allergy to cold weather. this person could have allergies to something in her sleeping environment like dust dust mites feather pillows detergents etc. which could make symptoms appear worse at night but she would need to be allergy-tested to make that determination."

    "Question": "how many bipolar disorders are there. because i'm studying on did which is one of them but i heard there was more?",
    "Answer": "there are many forms of bipolar disorder. i don't know how many. i have bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features. i tend to get manic and land myself in a psychiatric hospital when i am un-medicated. the bipolar aspect of my disorder: mood swings severe emotional highs and lows and occasional rapid cycling between feeling really good and really bad don't get me hospitalized or into any kind of legal trouble. the psychotic features of my brand of bipolar disorder have gotten me into lots of trouble. it is hard to behave in a way that makes sense when your mind doesn't. auditory hallucinations can be very confusing. visual hallucinations can be terrifying. i have never become manic and not become psychotic and a danger to myself or others. when a person is judged to be a danger to them self or others by a mental health crisis team they get institutionalized and held against their will in an inpatient psychiatric facility until they are no longer a threat to themselves or others. fortunately i only become psychotic when i am manic and mood stabilizers take care of that for me. it is unfortunate that i can't enjoy the euphoric feeling of being manic without becoming psychotic and then becoming a danger to myself or others. i am really missing out. being manic feels really good. alienating others and sometimes getting arrested does not feel good. in-patient psychiatric facilities are annoying places to live in but at least they are tolerable and know how to treat my mental illness quickly and efficiently by getting me back on my medication. my longest psychiatric hospitalization lasted 2 months. i generally only have to be hospitalized for about a week when i stop taking my medication and become manic/psychotic. i have been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons more than 2 dozen times. when a patient is ready for release is up to the staff not the patient at a psychiatric facility. i take lithium every day. lithium is a mood stabilizer. when stabilizing in a psychiatric ward or hospital other medications are also necessary in order to make me sane again. i have to take one of the following anti-psychotic medications to stabilize my sanity during a manic/psychotic episode: risperadol prolixin or thorazine. i have tried many more psychiatric medications before but these ones work for me. i don't like taking anti-psychotic medications because they have many unpleasant long term and short term side effects. fortunately i only have to take anti-psychotic medications while i am stabilizing and not to maintain stability. i don't mind lithium that much. i do have to take lithium or another mood stabilizing medication every day in order to maintain stability. i have met many other people with bipolar disorder before and there are many different kinds. i have met many other patients that have had other forms of it while i've been inside psychiatric facilities. i can't remember the names of any other forms of bipolar disorder but i do know a lot about mine."

    "Answer": "well the first thing you need to know is that real hormones (estrogen testosterone thyroid and all the many others) are a controlled substance that can only be obtained by prescription. i'm going to assume you're talking about female hormone replacement. you can't get that over-the-counter. what you can get are preparations that claim to relieve the symptoms of menopause. these over-the-counter hormone replacement alternative remedies may or may not be effective at relieving your symptoms. some women swear by them while others don't get much relief. assuming you're not allergic to any medications or supplements you certainly can try one of those products to see if it helps relieve your symptoms. if you want real female hormone replacement therapy (hrt) you'll have to talk with your health care provider. he or she can explain the risks and benefits of hrt and help you get on an appropriate dose of the medication. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what is atherosclerosis?",
    "Answer": "atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. the atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as teens in some people). when atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. therefore many adults are typically unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. but when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with aging it can cause critical narrowing of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen). arteries that are narrowed by advanced atherosclerosis can cause diseases in different organs. for example advanced atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (arteries that supply heart muscles) can lead to angina and heart attacks. advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) can lead to strokes and transient ischemic attacks (tias). advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities can lead to pain while walking or exercising (claudication) deficient wound healing and/or leg ulcers. atherosclerosis is often generalized meaning it affects arteries throughout the body. therefore patients with heart attacks are also more likely to develop strokes and peripheral vascular disease and vice versa."

    "Answer": "you need to become an expert in herpes so i am giving you some homework. <link> basically herpes is definitely contagious during an active outbreak on the lip (cold sores) or the genitals but since many people have contracted herpes when their partners do not have active lesions it is possible to catch it even during those asymptomatic dormant periods. if your boyfriend has genital lesions condoms offer good but not 100% protection as you will read."

    "Question": "could my previous method of birth control affect my fertility?",
    "Answer": "we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail; now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well. could there be long-term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving? let's review them briefly and put your mind at ease. 1. combined hormonal methods (e. g. birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring). these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility. we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle (whatever that means for you) within 3 months of stopping all of these methods. 2. progesterone only methods (the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant). we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months. the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due (since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot). again no long term impact on fertility 3. intrauterine device (iud). the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility (which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available). although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4. diaphragms condoms and spermicides. these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them. condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well. so where are the concerns regarding fertility? some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility. for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth. ."

    "Answer": "familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a group of genetic disorders that result in severe elevations of blood cholesterol levels. despite being of one the most common serious genetic disorders few people know about fh unless their life is affected in some way. the prevalence of fh is 1 in 300 to 500 in many populations. there are over 620 000 fh patients currently living in the united states. many of these people are unaware that their risk of premature coronary heart disease is elevated about 20-fold in patients that have not been treated. there are two different types of fh patients. the most serious type is called the homozygous form. this means that the genetic defect was inherited from both parents. homozygous fh type occurs in 1 out of every 1 000 000 individuals and is associated with the rapid and premature development of coronary heart disease in childhood or adolescence. many of these patients never live to see their second or third decade of life. the heterozygous form of fh means that that the genetic defect was inherited from one parent and is much more common. in certain populations such as french canadians the prevalence may be as high as 1 in 100. fh is a treatable disease. in addition to diet and lifestyle modification medications are an essential tool in management. some patients may require ldl apheresis which is a method of removing the bad cholesterol from the blood. some patients with the homozygote form have required liver transplantation to treat the disease."

    "Question": "what is subclinical hypothyroidism?",
    "Answer": "subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a state in which patients do not exhibit the symptoms of hypothyroidism. these patients also have a normal amount of circulating thyroid hormone. the only abnormality is an increased tsh level on their blood work. this implies that the pituitary gland is working extra hard to maintain a normal circulating thyroid hormone level and that the thyroid gland requires extra stimulation by the pituitary to produce adequate hormones. the majority of these patients can be expected to progress to obvious hypothyroidism especially if the tsh is above a certain level. while there is some controversy many endocrinologists will treat such patients especially if they have a high cholesterol blood level. the abnormal cholesterol profile will likely show improvement with thyroid hormone replacement. if the cholesterol levels are normal and the patient feels well it is also reasonable to follow these patients without treatment and repeat the blood tsh and thyroid hormone levels in four to six months to see if more significant hypothyroidism is apparent. both of these approaches are reasonable and patients should be encouraged to speak with their physicians about specific concerns and preferences."

    "Answer": "hi in the first year after the implant is fitted your periods may become irregular lighter heavier or longer. this usually settles down after the first year. a common side effect of the implant is that your periods stop (amenorrhoea). it's not harmful and it seems to trigger some bleeding that is dark brown. your periods may change significantly while using a contraceptive implant. around 20% of women using the implant will have no bleeding and almost 50% will have infrequent or prolonged bleeding. bleeding patterns are likely to remain irregular although they may settle down after the first year. although these changes are not harmful they may not be acceptable for some women. your gp may be able to help by providing additional medication if you have prolonged bleeding. but if you think hour still having problems please see your doctor. do hope this has helped you. good luck"

    "Question": "can macular degeneration cause pain? . my mother in law has pain in the ritgh eye than spikes to acute and goes down to mild. the pain comes and goes it usually the \"ttacks does not last long. she thinks in could be macular generation because she was test for glaucoma and was negative. at gross examination she has the inside of the lids brigh red the sclera is white. she is in a lot of pain severall times a day.",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear your mother-in-law is going through this but i'm glad she had glaucoma ruled out. severe eye pain should not be ignored. eye pain generally is not a symptom of age-related macular degeneration. i'd suggest your mother-in-law make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist (as distinct from an optometrist) to have this evaluated. an ophthalmologist is a medical doctor (md) who is specially trained to deal with high-level eye problems such as trauma glaucoma and other serious eye diseases. i wish you both all the best!"

    "Question": "i know most medications have an expiration date but what does that actually mean?",
    "Answer": "ah what a great question. i think i have a great answer! when you have medications in your house you can't guarantee that they are stored in the correct conditions (i bet many folks still keep everything in their bathroom cabinet). medications in the home get exposed to heat cold moisture light etc. unlike when they are stored in a pharmacy in their original container. this can lead to the breaking down of the medication which could cause the medication to not work as well or you can have an actual reaction to the components of the medication breaking down (so to answer your question it is not safe). if you notice on your prescription bottles it should have an expiration date from 1 year from the date you got the medication filled. this is to protect you from the possible scenarios i described above. it's always better to be safe than sorry."

    "Answer": "two common reasons for three year olds to have a on-going cough: undiagnosed asthma and day-care attendance. if you have a family history of allergies or asthma asthma should be carefully investigated. constant runny noses can trigger a cough as well. if your child is in day-care preschool or going to play groups she is constantly exposed this time of year to back-to-back viral infections. this alone can mimic asthma and cause a chronic cough."

    "Question": "why the tip of my stool is hard? it cause rectal bleed when i have my bowel movement. other part of stool is soft. i eat lots of fiber and drink lots of fluid i have bowel movement every day. this bleeding comes and go i went to my doctor and she gave me suppository but it didnt help alot. the bleeding is come and go its only when the tip of my stool is hard then it cuse bleeding again",
    "Answer": "sorry to hear you're going through this. from your description it sounds like you're experiencing moderate constipation that is causing a hemorrhoid to flare up occasionally. a hemorrhoid is a swollen vein in the rectum. a hard piece of stool can basically scratch this swollen vein and cause it to bleed slightly. frequently hemorrhoids also feel itchy and painful. perhaps this is why your doctor gave you a suppository to try. suppositories often are prescribed to treat the symptoms of hemorrhoids. it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids. because only the tip of your stool is hard it makes me think maybe you're not noticing the urge to have a bowel movement and are holding stool in your rectum too long. even though you're having a bowel movement every day you might try going to the bathroom a bit more frequently to see if you perhaps need to have a bowel movement but just aren't feeling the sensation to go. however do not strain needlessly in an attempt to force a bowel movement. that will just make any hemorrhoid situation worse. as long as you're not allergic to any medications you also might try an over-the-counter hemorrhoid medication to see if it helps shrink those swollen veins so at least the bleeding goes away. best of luck to you! this is what worked for me. as mentioned above fibrous food. i included boiled okra(twice a week for dinner) apple daily spinach (i'm an indian and i already love indian \"plain palak\" recipie dried plums(pitted prunes) 2liters of water a day. ( i follow this since i first came across this siuation) walking min of 30 mins a day. i also felt stress tension has played a role in causing this(to me atleast) i have the same problem which lead me to your thread. while i have had issues around constipation currently i have at least three bm's a day. and yes this hard piece is scraping against my hemorrhoid and causing pain and sometimes a little bleeding. i would think the answer might lie in what we are eating the combinations of food at each meal and how they digest. this issue doenst always happen for me but it is often"

    "Answer": "abnormal cravings are not unusual in pregnancy but a craving for chalk could mean that you have a condition called pica; a condition where people want to eat things not usually a part of a human diet. this may include plaster clay dirt or other substances. chalk is primarily calcium and may not be harmful per se but we really don't know for sure or that this would be safe in pregnancy. for some reason pregnant women do not want to be a part of any study that could cause possible harm to their unborn child so the data is nil on this practice. it would be best not to eat chalk if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. while it may be hard to prove harm it is really not worth the risk to you and your baby to just try it. here is one of several interesting articles on the subject: <link>"

    "Question": "what causes hives?",
    "Answer": "hives are produced when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells which are normally found in the skin. histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels leading to swelling in the skin. hives are very common. although they can be annoying they usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. some hives are caused by allergies to such things as foods medications and insect stings but in the majority of cases no specific cause for them is ever found. although patients may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives maneuvers like changing diet soap detergent and makeup are hardly ever helpful in preventing hives and are not necessary for the most part. having hives may cause stress but stress by itself does not cause hives. in rare cases (some hereditary others caused by bee stings or drug allergy) urticaria and angioedema are accompanied by a striking decrease in blood pressure (shock) and difficulty breathing. this is called anaphylaxis. ordinary hives may be widespread and disturbing to look at but the vast majority of cases of hives do not lead to life-threatening complications."

    "Answer": "i researched one of the many don-drowsy decongestants drixoral (generic name- pseudoephedrine ) on drugs. com. some brand names for this medicine include: chlor trimeton non-drowsy contac cold nasofed seudotabs siledrine sudefed and found in many other non-drowsy decongestants. some of the serious side-effects to be listed on their label include: fast pounding or uneven heartbeat severe dizziness or anxiety dangerously high blood pressure anxiety confusion fast- pounding or uneven heartbeat and severe dizziness. less serious side effects include: loss of appetite feeling restless or excited and sleep problems insomnia) a label warning states: avoid taking this medication if you also take diet pills caffeine pills or other stimulants (such as adhd medications). taking a stimulant together with a decongestant can increase your risk of unpleasant side effects. summary: this particular non-drowsy decongest seems to have similar properties and side effects seen in other non-drowsy decongestants; your husband’s sleep experience was more than likely due to the non-drowsy decongestant that he consumed; your characterization of the non-drowsy decongestant as possibly being stimulating seems to be a reasonable conclusion; and i would not take this type of medication during the evening hours prior to bedtime."

    "Question": "which foods should i eat to prevent osteoporosis?",
    "Answer": "it's great that you are looking to do something about osteoporosis now. prevention is very important because even though there are many treatment options for those who have it there is no cure once you do. your diet plays a key role in this. the key areas to focus on are: calcium: this is a mineral that your body needs every day for many functions. calcium plays a role in maintaining the strength of your bones and teeth as well as the functioning of your heart nerves and blood clotting. unfortunately the majority of the population is not taking in the required daily amount of calcium. when this happens your body will use the supply that you have from your bones to support the other functions that it is needed for. for this reason it's imperative that you meet your daily requirements every day. dietary sources of calcium are: dairy products: milk yogurt cheese and calcium-fortified cottage cheese. green leafy vegetables: broccoli kale collard greens dried figs turnip greens and mustard greens. fish: canned salmon and sardines with the bones. nuts: almonds and brazil nuts. enriched foods: cereals orange juice beverages and breads that have calcium added to them. there are things in your diet that can interfere with how much calcium your body can absorb: phytic acid: this is found in unleavened bread raw beans seeds and grains. oxalic acid: this is found in spinach. the calcium that spinach contains will not be absorbed because of this substance. sodium: the higher your sodium intake the more calcium your body needs to meet its daily requirements so it's best to keep your sodium intake down. you can usually meet your needs by having a diet balanced with high-calcium foods. if you need to take a supplement to reach your requirements speak with your physician about the best one for you. your body does not absorb more than 500 mg of calcium at one time so do not try to get all of your calcium in at one meal. vitamin d: this is a fat-soluble vitamin that comes from food and from your body being exposed to the ultraviolet (uv) rays from the sun. the uv rays from the sun trigger the production of vitamin d in your skin. vitamin d is necessary for calcium absorption so it is as essential as calcium is. the sources of vitamin d are: uv rays from the sun: this is probably the most ideal source of vitamin d. an exposure of 10 to 15 minutes of sun to your hands face arms or back without sunscreen for at least two times per week is usually sufficient to provide adequate vitamin d synthesis. sunscreen skin color season geographic latitude time of day clouds and smog affect uv ray exposure and vitamin d synthesis. fortified milk. fish: salmon mackerel and tuna fish. egg yolk. protein: maintain a balance of high-protein foods in your diet. these foods include meat seafood poultry eggs cheese beans and dairy. . phosphorus: this supports building bone and other tissue during growth. there is a wide availability of this in foods so it is not difficult to get adequate amounts in. sources of phosphorus are: dairy foods: milk cheese and yogurt. meat. baked goods. cereal. eggs. nuts. fish. soda. there are numerous other vitamins and minerals that can play a role in preventing osteoporosis."

    "Question": "is it bad to have a lot of pregnancy ultrasounds? . i had an ultrasound at 10 weeks because i hadn't told anyone about my pregnancy i had another one at 12 weeks. i am now 16 weeks and i haven't seen the doctor because we keep pushing the appointment back. i have an appointment next week and i just wanted to see if it would hurt to get another one just to make sure the baby is okay",
    "Answer": "nothing has ever suggested that ultrasounds are harmful. they just use high frequency sound waves to create the image not radiation like an x-ray would. when you're about 18 weeks along the doctor will perform another ultra-sound because at that time the baby's major organs start to develop so go see that doctor. best wishes."

    "Answer": "hepatitis means \"inflamed liver. \" as you probably know there are many different things that can cause the liver to become inflamed. we use the letters a b c and so on to denote several known bacterial and virus infections that cause hepatitis. hepatitis c is caused by a virus and cannot be cured. therefore it's important to know how you can get hep-c. you get hepatitis c through direct contact with infected blood. the typical ways this happens is: sharing needles used to inject illicit drugs getting a tattoo with a needle contaminated with hep-c getting a piercing using equipment contaminated with hep-c having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant prior to 1992 receiving an injection with a needle that was previously used to inject someone with hep-c you get the idea. hepatitis c is of particular concern to baby boomers because they may have become infected back in the summer of love (late 1960s) and not even know it. that's why the centers for disease control recommend all people born between 1946 and 1964 get tested for hep-c. hepatitis c can live in your body for years without causing symptoms. if you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis c you should see a health care provider. a simple blood test can tell you if you have the virus or not. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "it's difficult to answer your question due to some key information that's lacking. for example \"laser resurfacing\" can be done any almost any body part. usually after laser resurfacing of the face we advise patients to keep the skin slathered with moisturizer at all times. that's because the laser can cause severe drying of the skin. however for some people all that goop on the face can indeed cause a breakout of pimples. i suggest you consult your provider to find out if what you're experiencing is normal and if so how to treat it. laser resurfacing of the face also can cause a flare-up of cold sores. if this is the type of \"breakout\" you're referring to then you again should consult your provider to see if you can take a prescription medication to treat the cold sores. whenever a person undergoes a procedure like laser resurfacing they should receive clear written instructions that detail post-procedure care. if you don't receive written instructions you definitely need to ask a lot of questions and take notes about how to care for your skin after laser resurfacing what the normal healing process entails and so on. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "can varicose veins form a blood clot which can esentially cause a stroke? . i am a 52 year old female with varicose veins for approximately 20 years.",
    "Answer": "many people wonder if varicose veins can be a source of blood clots. the answer is \"not exactly. \" when people talk about \"blood clots \" they typically mean deep venous thromboses (dvt). these dangerous clots form in the deep tissue (typically of the calf muscle in the lower leg) and can break free and travel to the lungs causing a life-threatening pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). varicose veins generally aren't linked to dvts. why is this so? well it's because varicose veins generally form in the superficial tissue not the deep tissue. as you can see by looking at your own legs those gnarled varicose veins reside near the surface of the skin. by definition these are not \"deep\" veins. because varicose veins are flabby blood can indeed pool in them and probably clot up. however this becomes a problem of the local tissue. these clots generally don't travel anywhere else in the body. varicose veins usually are considered a cosmetic problem even though they can cause pain and feelings of heaviness in the legs. varicose veins can run in families. if your leg veins are bothering you consult a physician who specializes in treating this problem. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "there are two areas of the body where problems can arise which cause low testosterone levels. the first area is in your testicles. testosterone is produced in the testicles. the second area is the hormone control centers in the brain the hypothalamus and the pituitary. when testosterone levels fall the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary to produce the hormones lh and fsh. these hormones travel in the blood stream and cause the testicles to produce testosterone and sperm. the effect of low testosterone levels on a man depends on his age when the low levels develop. in adults fatigue lack of sex drive and depression occur within a few weeks of developing low testosterone levels. decreased muscle mass and body hair are less common and do not occur for a year or more after the onset of testosterone deficiency. the first step when low testosterone levels are found is to confirm the results with repeat testing and test for free or bioavailable testosterone. free and bioavailable testosterone are a clearer representation of the active hormone as opposed to the total testosterone which is the more commonly measured initial test. the next step is to measure lh and fsh. normal or low levels of lh and fsh in the face of a low testosterone level suggest that the control centers in the brain are not working properly. high levels of lh and fsh pinpoint to a problem in the testicles. a cat scan is done to see if there is a tumor in the pituitary. a common pituitary tumor that causes low testosterone levels is a prolactin tumor. this is another hormone secreted by the pituitary. prolactin causes the hypothalamic region of the brain to malfunction. besides tumors damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus in adults can occur from surgery injury infections radiation therapy and with high doses or long-term use of narcotics or steroids. causes of failure of the testicles to produce testosterone include; chemotherapy radiation therapy excessive alcohol consumption infections such as mumps tumors medications trauma toxins chronic diseases and torsion of the testicles (twisting). sometimes no specific cause is found. talk with your doctor about your hormone levels and what could be causing your symptoms. treatment for low testosterone levels is important in men not only for their wellbeing but to make sure that their muscles and bones stay strong."

    "Question": "we have humaqna hmo. how will the affordable care act effect me? . we both have had cancer in the past. my partner had 1/2 of his right lung removed and no further treatments. i have a lumpectomy. 34 rounds of radiation & 4 treatments of chemo.",
    "Answer": "you don't mention how you get your insurance -- at work or buy it on your own. if you buy your own insurance it's possible you may be required to switch to a different plan if the one you currently have isn't compliant with the new law. if that's the case your insurer should have already sent you a notice. the good news for you and your partner is that starting january 1 2014 the affordable care act prohibits insurers from turning anyone down because of a pre-existing condition. that means you'll have the freedom to shop new options and will be guaranteed coverage. open enrollment is now underway. you can look on healthcare. gov to start learning what's available to you in your state. if you're happy with you current plan and it isn't being phased out you can also stick with what you've got."

    "Answer": "the redness may be inflammation but i don't have enough information about the type and location of your fracture nor do i have the ability to examine your foot. the only person that can address this issue would be the medical professional who is currently treating you -- someone who knows the details of your case and your medical history. i'm just looking for what it might be. it's not swollen just red. the 4th and 5th metatarsals are fractured. i had an x-ray done but no one has treated it per se. just want to know what the redness could indicate. thank you"

    "Question": "can you drink alchol if you took two 800 ibuprofen? . i took 2 800 ibeprofen pills because my back was hurting from a car accident that i got into a year ago but i took them probably an hour or so apart then forgot that i took them an an hr after that drank a small amount of alcohol.",
    "Answer": "if this happened only once and you didn't have any side effects then i would think its fine. however if you do it on a daily basis or even more that twice a week you may experience some stomach bleeding or even ulcers. ibuprofen is the active ingredient is motrin advil and others. if you do make a habit of taking motrin or advil and then forget and start drinking alcohol you could end up in the hospital. so be careful. you don't need ulcers or have your stomach to bleed. if you have other health problems ask you doctor about something safe to take and be sure that you do on occasion have a drink and want him to recommend something to take for pain that won't bother your stomach. taking any pain medication with ibuprofen can lead to blood clots high blood pressure and stroke and you don't need that. if you think that maybe you need to go to see your doctor then go. i know that people can do pain medication and then forget i know i have but i learned my lesson so please when you want to take something ask your doctor or ask a pharmacist. i do hope you are feeling better and please keep us informed and if you need any more help just let us know. thank you"

    "Question": "does exercise help cognitive function?",
    "Answer": "one of the most exciting areas of exercise research is the investigation of cognitive function. what scientists have learned so far is that brain neurons the special cells that help you think move perform all the bodily functions that keep you alive and even help your memory all increase in number after just a few days or weeks of regular activity. in a study where researchers used an mri machine to measure the amount of brain tissue in adults 55 years of age and older they found -- consistent with other studies of aging and brain volume -- that there were substantial declines in brain tissue density as a function of age in areas of the brain responsible for thinking and memory but importantly the losses in these areas were substantially reduced as a function of cardiovascular fitness. in other words the fittest individuals had the most brain tissue. how might fitness and more brain tissue help you? in another meta-analysis of older adults researchers found that the fittest individuals had the highest scores on tasks like coordination scheduling planning and memory. and in a recent study of 1 740 adults older than 65 researchers found that the incidence of dementia in individuals who walked three or more times per week was 35% lower than those individuals who walked less than three days per week."

    "Question": "why do black people have a different smell?",
    "Answer": "there are no differences in the smell of anyone of a different race. skin color does not have an odor. that is not to say that humans do not have their own smells. a person who eats different or aromatic foods or spices can smell different to someone who is not familiar with the smell. a person who smokes smells quite different to a non-smoker. a person who is not diligent in their personal hygiene practices can have all sorts of body odors. i have set with plenty of them on a crowded plane. there may be a smell of poverty when someone wants to be clean but does not have the same access to a shower or laundry facilities like you do. some people do not wear deodorant or use cologne. some use too much and make my eyes water. smells are in the nose of the beholder. to say that a black person smells different than any other race can be considered a racist statement. one that has absolutely no speck of truth. racial differences usually result from genetic adaptations to climate. dark skin is protected from sunburn but absorbs more heat produces more sweat. blacks sweat more than whites. as sweat evaporates it cools. good. but. sweat carries with it many organic and inorganic compounds pretty much same as in urine which beneficial bacteria on the skin consume and \"poop\" on the skin. blacks wind up with more pee and bacteria poop it is that which does not smell good on the skin. a lot of it is not \"stink\" \"per se\" all races have a unique smell generally we each like \"our own\" think \"different\" is unpleasant. not really."

    "Answer": "assuming the prescription belongs to you you're in the early part of your pregnancy and your ob/gyn knows about it then you and your baby should be ok. many women take prescription opioids such as hydrocodone during pregnancy and these appear to be pretty safe. however using any pain relievers (even over-the-counter ones) late in pregnancy (third trimester) can be risky for both mother and fetus. you should get your ob/gyn's advice and direction on this subject. keep in mind it's never ok to take narcotics that have not been prescribed to you. pregnant or not you should only take narcotics under the supervision of a doctor or other qualified medical professional. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "my short answer: no. mobile \"health scans\" are a recent fad. for a fee some organization will take a whole-body ct scan or some foolishness. it's not beneficial for most people and it exposes you to a hefty dose of radiation. in your case i think the question is: are you considering doing this for fear of lung cancer? if so consult your primary care physician. a simple chest x-ray is a good starting point for diagnosing lung cancer. and lung cancer isn't the only smoking-related cancer. bladder cancer colon cancer and mouth cancers all are high on the list of cancers smokers experience. i don't say that to scare you but merely to point out that shelling out $100 for a chest ct scan isn't necessarily a good option if you're concerned about smoking side effects. let's just be realistic for a moment. do you want to quit smoking? at age 71 after 50 years of smoking it's ok to say \"no. \" you just need to understand you may be trading some life expectancy for your enjoyment of smoking. if you're ok with that so be it. on the other hand it's never too late to quit. if you have no signs of any cancers in your body and you wish to possibly extend your life expectancy talk to your health care provider about all the new options to help you quit smoking. two prescription medications in particular have good track records for helping people quit permanently. there's no shame in using a stop-smoking aid. quitting cold turkey is the least successful method. i wish you all the best!"

    "Answer": "the typical symptoms of coronary artery disease are associated chest pain with shortness of breath. classically the pain of angina is described as a pressure or heaviness behind the breast bone with radiation to the jaw and down the arm accompanied by shortness of breath and sweating. unfortunately angina has a variety of presentations and there may not even be specific chest pain. there may be shoulder or backache nausea indigestion or upper abdominal pain. women the elderly and people with diabetes may have different perceptions of pain or have no discomfort at all. instead they may complain of malaise or fatigue. health care providers and patients may have difficulty understanding each other when symptoms of angina are described. patients may experience pressure or tightness but may deny any complaints of pain. people with coronary artery disease usually have gradual progression of their symptoms over time. as an artery narrows over time the symptoms that it causes may increase in frequency and/or severity. health care providers may inquire about changes in exercise tolerance (how far can you walk before getting symptoms? is it to the mailbox? up a flight of stairs? ) and whether there has been an acute change in the symptoms. patients may be asymptomatic until a heart attack occurs. of course some patients also may be in denial as to their symptoms and procrastinate in seeking care."

    "Answer": "if you are taking the over-the-counter product read and follow all directions on the package label. if your doctor has prescribed this medication for you take as directed by your doctor. if you have any questions consult your doctor or pharmacist. take this medication by mouth with or without food or as directed by your doctor. if stomach upset occurs it may help to take this medication with food or milk. drink plenty of fluids when you use this medication unless otherwise directed by your doctor. the fluid will help loosen the mucus in your lungs. if you are using the liquid form of this medication carefully measure the dose using a special measuring device/spoon. do not use a household spoon because you may not get the correct dose. if your liquid form is a suspension shake the bottle well before each dose. if you are taking the extended-release capsules swallow them whole. do not crush or chew extended-release capsules or tablets. doing so can release all of the drug at once increasing the risk of side effects. also do not split extended-release tablets unless they have a score line and your doctor or pharmacist tells you to do so. swallow the whole or split tablet without crushing or chewing. if you are taking the chewable form of this medication chew it thoroughly before swallowing. the dosage is based on your age medical condition and response to treatment. do not increase your dose take it more frequently or use it for a longer time than directed. do not give children medicines labeled only for adults. tell your doctor if your condition persists for more than 1 week if it worsens or if it occurs with rash persistent headache or fever lasting more than 3 days. these may be symptoms of a serious medical problem and should be checked by a doctor."

    "Question": "what illnesses often co-exist with bipolar disorder?",
    "Answer": "i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with major highs (euphoria) appx 9 years ago that co-occured with adult adhd aggressive personality and anger issues. i was medicated with lamicta serquel and adderall. needless to say i was on a roller coaster and after a while no longer desired medical help. over the last 4 years i've slipped off into a whirl wind of mental problems. i have now encountered high blood pressure tmj panic attacks multiple fractures in my lower limbs (without known cause) due to avascular necrosis which is medical terms for death of bone i also over the last 2 1/2 years had constant headaches with up to as many as 12 migraines (go to the er type) a month i do not sleep well and grind my teeth in return broken them i have unexplained pains and aches throughout most of my body on a daily bases some that go as quickly as they came my outburst are 10x worse now than ever. mostly in the evening time when my children and husband get home my reproductive system after stopping treatment failed and unfortunately after 3 cyst were removed and my sons premature birth i was basically pushed into having a partial hystercotomy i have sinus infections around every 6-8 weeks with 3 known cyst in my left sinus cavities. i just recently (last week) went back to my dr a new one and briefly told her what my issues were and how i havent been treated in several years. she has started me on a low dose of adderall again and recommended i see a specialist to combine biopolar treatment. she doesnt know my deepest struggles or demons and i've learned to mask my problems around strangers if possible so answering her questionnaire was simple as not being quite honest due to my own fears of being judged. bipolar affected my grandmother my aunt one of my cousins. i'd say my mother is borderline and my younger brother is. i unfortunately see it in my daughter who is only 5 and my oldest son who is nearly 10 is hard to tell cause he is adhd but i believe it is masking bipolar because he is very depressed alot but also has been through some tough stuff with me and other problems. i have found that i turn to other releases due to pain management of other physical issues though i feel okay for an hour or so any pain meds prescribed to me tend to accelerate my mood swings and i've found them to be addicting mentally though i never intended to use them for other than my multiple breaks. my adderall definitely intensifies panic mainly in the evening. but its ultimately a huge help for the morning due to shuffling kids and my husband and i own our own company. i cant work with the public due to this nor be in social situations. my marriage has been a disaster for atleast 2 1/2 years and it is me but now my husband has became moody as well and i do whole heartedly believe it started due to my mental problems. i do not at the moment take anything other than my adderall and pain meds for my fractures and honestly decided today i dont really think adderall is the best thing unless im treated with something else for the moods. i still have to make an appt with a specialized dr and treatment will take quite sometime because of my fear of drs due to years back when all this started they put me on so so so many different meds i felt like a lab rat and nothing seemed to truly work and i dont really honestly open up to a dr. i will never tell them about my addictions nor will i ever tell them my increased thoughts of suicide. many things can co-exist with bipolar. mimic it. mask it. and everyone is different. it is a horrible disease unfortunately and is something when you hit rock bottom if you have the courage and will to get help you will. if you are like me you'll ruin everything you have because of fear. and honestly this is the first time i've truly opened up about certain things i feel or that i have associated with my bipolar. some may see these things or believe i experience these things but i do not truly discuss them with anyone not my mother. my husband (most i do) or my dr."

    "Answer": "dry skin is a frustrating condition and winter makes it even worse. if you have a moisturizer that does not burn then you should stick with that. here are a few more dry skin tips for winter: * take warm showers not hot. when possible rinse in cooler water. this helps your skin to not over-respond to the hot water by becoming more dry and red. * after showering washing your face or hands be sure to dry your skin completely with a dry towel. i'm not sure why this is but we tend to only partially dry our hands during the winter and this will contribute to the development of really dry skin that is prone to cracking and breaking. * use a humidifier in your room. winter air is dry and your skin suffers from this. raising the humidity in your home will help your overall symptoms. * obviously you want to stay well hydrated so drink plenty of water and water-containing beverages eat fruit and vegetables. stay away from caffeine and alcohol because they dehydrate you."

    "Answer": "drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting are called antiemetics. many types of antiemetics can decrease the severity of nausea although most require a medical evaluation and prescription. medicines available over-the-counter are mainly recommended for use in motion sickness and for cases of mild nausea. meclizine hydrochloride (bonine) is an antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of nausea vomiting and dizziness associated with motion sickness. unless recommended by a doctor it should not be taken by people with lung diseases glaucoma or those who have difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate. meclizine may cause drowsiness and should not be taken with other sedatives such as alcohol tranquilizers or sleeping pills. due to drowsiness people using meclizine should not drive or operate dangerous machinery. meclizine is not recommended in children under 12 or in pregnant or nursing women unless recommended by a doctor. dimenhydrinate (dramamine) also is an antihistamine. its use should be limited to motion sickness. it can cause drowsiness and should be avoided in the same situations as meclizine. several different formulations of dimenhydrinate are available including a children's liquid which should be used according to the directions under the direction of a doctor. dramamine less drowsy formula contains meclizine like bonine and may have fewer sedative side effects. both meclizine and dimenhydrinate are recommended to be taken about an hour before travel to prevent motion sickness. emetrol is an oral solution designed to soothe the stomach when nausea and vomiting are caused by a viral or bacterial infection or overeating. emetrol contains sugar and phosphoric acid. diabetes patients should not use emetrol without medical supervision because of the concentrated sugar. according to its manufacturer emetrol should not be taken for more than five doses in one hour without consulting a doctor. consult a doctor before using this medicine for pregnant or nursing women and young children. bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) is a product containing bismuth subsalicylate a chemical shown to be effective in relieving nausea and upset stomach. this remedy has a direct effect on the stomach lining and has no known serious side effects. it may cause darkening of the stool color and of the tongue. pregnant or nursing women should consult their doctors before using bismuth subsalicylate since part of the active ingredient (salicylate) is chemically similar to aspirin which may harm infants and the fetus. patients allergic to aspirin or related drugs also should not use bismuth subsalicylate. use under the direction of a doctor if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or have diabetes or gout because the salicylate may further promote the anticoagulant effect."

    "Answer": "if you have true lab-confirmed chlamydia cultured from your genital area or urine then you have an sexually-transmitted disease (std). an std does not fly into through the window or jump up in your genitals from a toilet. while lab tests can be occasionally be incorrect the most logical way anyone gets chlamydia is from someone else who has chlamydia. the only person that you can be 100% sure of not having sex with someone else is you another universal truth is that not all men your husband included tell the truth. all of the time. i hope he did not go out and scratch a seven-year itch."

    "Question": "i have asthma and i've been taking albuterol sulfate every 2 hours is this bad? what effects will it have on me?",
    "Answer": "your asthma is not well-controlled. you should not be taking albuterol so frequently. whether you are taking the albuterol via an inhaler or as a pill using it every two hours isn't recommended and can cause side effects such as shakiness and an irregular heartbeat. i suggest you contact your primary care provider for an appointment as soon as possible to discuss other medications to control your asthma. everyone with asthma should carry a rescue inhaler (such as albuterol) but a bronchodilator is no longer considered the primary form of treatment for asthma. on a good medication regimen you can improve your quality of life and avoid possible complications from using so much albuterol. if you experience a severe asthma attack that does not improve when you use a rescue inhaler you should seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-1-1 (or the emergency number wherever you're located). asthma can quickly turn fatal and you must waste no time in receiving emergency treatment for an attack that does not respond to a rescue inhaler. do not drive (or have someone else drive you) to an emergency room. instead get an ambulance sent to your house so paramedics can begin immediate emergency treatment. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "most of the factors that lead to the development of hernias are beyond the control of the individual. some of those factors are inherited and develop as the individual grows. the arrangement of the local tissues and their thickness and strength may greatly affect the relative risk of developing a hernia over a lifetime. however that risk can be increased by failure to use good body mechanics when lifting poor abdominal support posture and weight-control problems."

    "Answer": "the answer really needs to be individual. you need to decide from a personal point of view from a social point of view and a religious point of view what is best for your child. i used to say that if the father’s circumcised from an identity point of view it’s always good for the son to be because when he looks in the shower looking up at dad it’s nice that part a matches part a they bond that way. but the truth is there’s not any absolute clear reason to have to have it. yes better hygiene. yes it’s easier to maintain with cleanliness the risk for penile cancer is lower in circumcised men but that’s extremely rare in this country. if you maintain normal hygiene penile cancer is unheard of. so the benefits are really more social we do know there are some studies that it’s rarer to contract hiv and other illness because the circumcised penis the skin becomes a little bit thicker so it’s a little less likely to be something during sex less chance for infections. the uncircumcised penis again has more risks as far as scarring as you get older where it scars down or you have to have a circumcision or other technique to open it and also concerns over hygiene. but realistically in this day and age if the boy is clean there’s no biological need to have it it’s really more of a personal or religious social."

    "Answer": "last week i started in on soup. the weather is distinctly fall and even feeling wintry in some parts of the country. it is definitely soup weather. we ran out of my noni’s minestrone on saturday afternoon this weekend at my restaurant (the amount we made would have usually lasted through monday! ). since our minestrone takes all day to make i needed to come up with a quick soup to fill in for the cold and rainy saturday crowd. i deferred to my favorite butternut squash soup. i have been on a bit of a band wagon for the winter squashes. it is squash season and i think they are versatile and delicious so bear with me. butternut squash soup can be so creamy and delicious with no cream added. i start by putting 1-3 whole squashes in the oven and roasting at 400 with skins on until they are soft enough to easily cut with a sharp knife (about 5-10 minutes). from there i cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. do not throw these little crunchy nuggets of goodness away! you can clean the seeds sprinkle with salt and roast them to make a great topping for the soup. next decide which direction flavor-wise you want to go. indian? sprinkle the squash liberally with your favorite curry powder before you roast. if you want an herb flavor use fresh thyme or sage and garlic cloves. now that you have added your favorite herbs and spices roast the cleaned out squash until they are very tender and starting to get a bit golden. when they reach this point remove from the oven scoop the flesh out of the skins and place it in a blender. you can add chicken or vegetable stock and blend until smooth. i also like to sauté onion or shallot in a bit of olive oil until soft and add it to the squash in the blender. from here you can top with the toasted seeds and a bit of plain yogurt (add lemon zest a pinch of salt and a squeeze of juice to create a crème fraiche-like topping for the soup). serve this warm and satisfying soup with a side salad and toasted multigrain bread for a comforting and healthy dinner."

    "Answer": "yes. malaria may pose a serious threat to a pregnant woman and her fetus. malaria infection in pregnant women may be more severe than in women who are not pregnant. malaria may also increase the risk of problems with the pregnancy including prematurity abortion and stillbirth. statistics indicate that in sub-saharan africa between 75 000-200 000 infants die from malaria per year; worldwide estimates indicate about 2 million children die from malaria each year. therefore all pregnant women who are living in or traveling to a malaria risk area should consult a doctor and take prescription drugs (for example sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) to avoid contracting malaria. treatment of malaria in the pregnant female is similar to the usual treatment described above; however drugs such as primaquine (primaquine) tetracycline (achromycin sumycin) doxycycline and halofantrine (halfan) are not recommended as they may harm the fetus. in addition to monitoring the patient for anemia an ob/gyn specialist often is consulted for further management."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer you ask a great question and i'm going to try to give you a great answer. if only it were that simple! first i think we should acknowledge your current girlfriend for informing you about her hpv diagnosis. that is a very responsible and brave thing to do. she is behaving the way every adult should act in this situation. as to your risk for developing hpv if you have sexual contact with your girlfriend well it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. human papillomavirus (hpv) can exist in the skin without manifesting as warts. this means you can't always tell visually whether or not a person has hpv and you can contract the virus through skin-to-skin contact even in the absence of warts. also a condom often does not protect against this contact because the hpv-infected area of a woman's vulva may contact the portion of your penis or scrotum not covered by the condom. all of that said hpv also can clear up on its own. one study showed around 90 percent of female study participants showed no trace of the virus about two years after their initial diagnosis. this means it's possible your girlfriend's body has cleared the virus on its own. on the other hand the hpv virus can go dormant for years. maybe your girlfriend's case is dormant not cleared. to your question about \"is your risk of getting hpv higher with this woman than with the general population \" the answer is yes if she is currently infected and no if she has cleared the virus. keep in mind if you contract hpv from this girlfriend you risk transmitting the virus to another girlfriend down the road (even if you use a condom). as i'm sure you know certain strains of hpv cause cervical cancer. you should consider whether or not you want to be even remotely responsible for spreading this potentially life-threatening virus. clear as mud? wishing you well! buy generic viagra in usa in best price. we are providing to best price medicine to relieve erecticle dysfunction and change your life. generic viagra from a brand you keep faith. generic viagra drug for impotent men contains sildenafil citrate. buy generic viagra online at <link> or call at +1 6097475517"

    "Answer": "the short answer is: no. but this deserves a bit more discussion. heartburn is a pain that you feel around mid-chest and is caused by acid moving back up into the esophagus from the stomach. this pain often will go away when you take an antacid product such as a chewable tablet like tums or rolaids or a liquid product like maalox. despite its name heartburn does not involve the heart. ischemia is a condition in which body tissue doesn't get enough oxygen usually due to decreased blood flow. the term ischemia is often applied to the heart muscle but ischemia can happen to any muscle or even the brain. when the heart suffers from ischemia it can trigger a pain response which is called \"angina. \" this pain also occurs mid-chest like heartburn so it can sometimes be tricky figuring out if chest pain is a result of stomach acid (heartburn) or ischemia. the two conditions (heartburn and ischemia) have different underlying sources and are not related except in terms of causing pain in the chest. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "congratulations! it sounds like you are doing an excellent job with your lifestyle changes. diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treating both heart disease and diabetes. but at the same time there are many studies that show that taking statins after a heart attack can actually help prevent future heart attacks as well. a major study called the care trial showed that people who were on statins for at least 5 years after a heart attack were less likely to need further procedures such as bypass surgery or stents. they were also less likely to die from heart disease. statins can help keep plaque from building up in the arteries including those around the heart. in some cases they can actually cause a regression of the plaque. a statin may also help stabilize this plaque so that it is less likely to break and cause a blood clot. a blood clot in an artery on the heart wall is what causes most heart attacks. it is very important that you work closely with your doctor. your lipid levels and other risk factors should continue to be carefully monitored. talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your medications. working together you will be able to come up with a long term treatment plan that is right for you. keep up the great work!"

    "Answer": "both a sinus infection and a (middle) ear infection can cause dizziness. while antibiotics do not typically cause dizziness you may find it listed among the less-common side effects. augmentin typically causes an upset stomach or diarrhea but not dizziness. keep in mind that there can be hundreds of other causes of dizziness so if your symptoms persist you will need to consult your medical provider."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer this mystery may remain unexplained until you see your gynecologist for a proper examination and perhaps a few diagnostic tests. this could be a normal (although annoying) vaginal discharge due to some overactive hormones not unlike a runny nose or constant tearing. whether there is anything that can be done medically would depend on the exact cause -- not something that that i can accurately determine blindly over the internet."

    "Question": "what happens to someone when they get type 1 diabetes children living with the disease?",
    "Answer": "every child experiences type 1 diabetes differently. what they do have in common is that having diabetes will not affect their learning ability or school performance. 1 the negative effects of diabetes are caused by blood sugar levels that are above or below a target range. low blood sugar very low blood sugar is a frightening experience for you and your child. but if low blood sugar levels are treated quickly and appropriately your child should have no lasting effects. young children cannot recognize low blood sugar symptoms as well as adults can which puts them at risk for low blood sugar emergencies. children who develop hypoglycemia unawareness or are trying to keep their blood sugar levels tightly within a target range are also at risk for low blood sugar emergencies. make sure your child's caregivers such as school nurses know: how to watch for symptoms of low blood sugar. how to do a home blood sugar test. what to do if your child's blood sugar level is low. let your doctor know if your child is having frequent episodes of low blood sugar. high blood sugar very high blood sugar puts your child at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis a life-threatening emergency. stress illness injury and puberty can trigger high blood sugar. because blood sugar levels usually rise slowly you can treat symptoms early and most often prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. high blood sugar can also lead to: adjustment of the body to high levels. for example if your child's blood sugar level is consistently at 250 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and suddenly drops to 100 mg/dl you or your child may think this level is too low when it is really not. your child may even have symptoms of low blood sugar at normal blood sugar levels. delayed growth and maturity. if your child has high blood sugar levels over a long period of time he or she may grow and mature more slowly. during puberty this can delay normal sex changes and the onset of menstruation. developing complications from the disease ( eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve disease). children seem to be protected from developing these complications during childhood. but if their blood sugar levels are persistently high children are more likely to show early signs of these complications particularly eye and kidney disease. in addition high blood sugar levels during childhood and adolescence put your child at risk for these diseases in early adulthood. what can be done? the best way to help your child with type 1 diabetes live a long and healthy life is to keep his or her blood sugar levels within a target range. two important studies diabetes control and complications trial (dcct) and its follow-up study showed that keeping blood sugar levels in this range greatly decreases the chance of developing complications. work with your child's doctor and monitor blood sugar levels frequently. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) may rarely increase the risk for a heart attack or stroke. the risk may be greater if you have heart disease or increased risk for heart disease (for example due to smoking family history of heart disease or conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes) or with longer use. this drug should not be taken right before or after heart bypass surgery (cabg). this drug may infrequently cause serious (rarely fatal) bleeding from the stomach or intestines. this effect can occur without warning at any time while taking this drug. older adults may be at higher risk for this effect. stop taking ibuprofen and get medical help right away if you notice any of these rare but serious side effects: black/tarry stools persistent stomach/abdominal pain vomit that looks like coffee grounds chest/jaw/left arm pain shortness of breath unusual sweating confusion weakness on one side of the body slurred speech sudden vision changes. talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the benefits and risks of taking this drug."

    "Question": "is there any difference between the generic and brand name versions of my prescription sleep aid?",
    "Answer": "that is a great question. i just want consumers and patients to know that the fda does approve the generic versions of medications. they do have to have the same active ingredient but they will differ a little bit in how the tablets are made. they may contain a different salt a different sugar. they are not going to look exactly like the brand they might be a different color but they do contain the same active ingredient. now one of the things that i want consumers and patients to know too is that we are finding out is that patients react differently to medications. and how i take a pill and how you take a pill might have a different effect. this is kind of the same thing with medication prescription on the prescription side. so once again if you feel that the generic isn't working talk to your pharmacist. you may have to be switched to a different brand or you may have to go back actually on the actual brand medication or a controlled-release form instead. pharmacists can talk to you a little bit more about it. we can then let your doctor or healthcare provider know that you are not feeling the same effect as compared to when you had the brand medication and get you switched. but once again ask your pharmacist that's what we are here for; we are here for you to ask us any question don't be afraid to. we are the medication experts and we are here to help you."

(13 yo started period) they aren't like most girls. i started my period not that long ago and i realized that my nipples aren't normal. they're just puffy/smooth with no bud. when i'm cold they look stiffer or slightly more tighter? there still wouldn't be a bud. i did the test where you pinch the areola and it worked but i still don't know if it's effective because i'm young. this makes me very self-conscious no matter how much people say i shouldn't be. is this a part of puberty? will they stay this way? if so how can i change them? help!",
    "Answer": "hi found you this answer from netdoctor. co. uk it should interest you as its all about your little problem. inverted nipples are quite common but women are not often aware of this because it is not a popular topic of conversation. inverted nipples are sometimes regarded with a degree of embarrassment although there is no reason for this. i don't think your own situation is going to be too much of a problem because your nipples are capable of 'coming out' (becoming everted). this is probably more noticeable when you are cold or aroused. your nipples contain some erectile tissue that causes them to become more prominent. the biological reason for this is to aid breastfeeding. although your nipples may be flat or inverted a lot of the time when the erectile tissue is stimulated they stick out. you can encourage them to be more permanently erect by rolling the nipples between thumb and forefinger frequently perhaps several times a day over a period of time. also gently pulling on the nipple when it is erect can help make this state more permanent. you can also buy nipple shields to use. these are designed really for women in pregnancy who want to improve their chances of breastfeeding but there is no reason why non-pregnant women can't use them. they consist of a circular plastic disc with a central hole. the disc exerts pressure on the tissue around the nipple and encourages the nipple to protrude through the central hole. they can be worn at any time. in pregnancy many women find their flat or inverted nipples become everted anyway in association with the breast changes and enlargement of pregnancy. i certainly would not advise surgery for this benign condition. yours sincerely the netdoctor medical team do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "that's wonderful that you are providing 24 hour care for your mom. it's also wonderful that you are focusing on your own health as well. finding ways to exercise in your home as well as working on your diet could help you lose the weight you have gained in the last year. losing weight usually takes time and taking small steps in increasing your exercise and eating fewer calories every week could help. also seeing your primary doc to make sure there is not a health reason like a thyroid problem causing your weight gain would be beneficial. being a caregiver can be challenging and many caregivers are at risk of experiencing some caregiver burnout. here is a link that provides insight for caregivers. <link> take care as in every other similar case what i want to suggest is to try increase your metabolism. there are many options in order to succed it: drink 3 litres of water/day eat 6 small meals/day eat much protein try working out even at home for a few minutes follow some of these and they will definiltely help you and remember: starvation is not a solution!"

    "Answer": "a stress fracture is a fracture of the bone that is not caused by trauma. when it comes to the hip and pelvis there are two common kinds of fractures (breaks). the first is a traumatic fracture. this is caused by something like a fall or an auto accident. in a traumatic fracture of the hip the ends of the bones may or may not align with each other. for example it's not uncommon for the head of the femur (the \"thigh bone\") to break off in the socket of the pelvis. traumatic fractures of the hip almost always require surgery. in contrast a stress fracture of the hip or pelvis can occur from ordinary weight-bearing activities like walking. if a person has osteoporosis (thin bones) the simple activity of walking can cause small fractures (breaks) in the hip or pelvis. in general these breaks are relatively minor. sometimes they are called \"hairline fractures\" because the pieces of bones stay in place. stress fractures often can be treated with rest and diet changes like increasing calcium and/or vitamin d. calcium and vitamin d help bones stay strong. after a period of time the bones may knit back together on their own. if you've been diagnosed with a stress fracture of the hip or pelvis be sure to follow your doctor's instructions carefully. a stress fracture may be a sign of weak bones. you will want to follow all medical instructions to make sure the bone heals and you have no further problems. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "i have a circular sore with an open hole in middle of it located on a cheek of my buttlock. it has slight purple hue around it and hurts when touched.",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. a number of different conditions could cause the type of sore you're describing. your best bet is to have it checked out by a health care professional. it could be something simple like a boil but an open sore any place on the body should be evaluated due to the possibility of infection. meanwhile assuming you have no medication allergies you're probably safe to clean the wound gently with plain soap and water and then apply some over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (like generic \"triple antibiotic ointment\"). that's just a short-term fix however this will not cure the problem. wishing you all the best!"

    "Question": "if you disolved medication in diet coke do you have to ingest it in a certain amount of time for it to be effective? . i overlook the care of a child with a seizure disorder she does not like to take her medication so we dissolve it in diet coke the question has been asked if this affects the effectiveness of the medication.",
    "Answer": "this is a great question and i'm glad you asked it. not all medications are effective if dissolved in a liquid. i'd suggest you check with the child's doctor or pharmacist to learn if this technique is appropriate with the medication in question. meanwhile i'd recommend dissolving the medication in the smallest amount of liquid possible and having the child drink it all at once. for example if you could dissolve the medication in an ounce or two of cola you could reward her with the remainder of the can after she drinks the portion containing the medicine. dissolving the medication in a small amount of fluid will create a higher concentration of it in the mixture so that when she takes it she'll get something close to the full dose. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "hi your first miscarriage is known as a chemical miscarriage in the first 12 weeks. there are probably many reasons why a miscarriage may happen although the cause isn't usually identified. the majority aren't caused by anything the mother has done. it's thought most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby. chromosomes are genetic \"building blocks\" that guide the development of a baby. if a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes it won't develop properly. the majority of miscarriages can't be prevented. if a woman has suffered from more than three miscarriages some women can be helped to keep their pregnancy with medication under the care of a specialist. however there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of a miscarriage. avoid smoking drinking alcohol and using drugs while pregnant. being a healthy weight before getting pregnant eating a healthy diet and reducing your risk of infection can also help. most of what is above come via the uk’s nhs. i think in the time span you should be ok now. good luck"

    "Answer": "the number of new antibiotics in development is alarmingly low and it's a matter of resources. antibiotics are taken for a shorter period of time and it's more economical for drug companies to make drugs that are taken for a long time. we're also promoting the concept of using these antibiotics judiciously so companies and researchers don't see the economic benefit. antibiotics are not used in volume like a cholesterol or diabetes medication. the fda is currently considering options to facilitate new antibiotic development."

    "Question": "how can i get my baby to sleep through the night?",
    "Answer": "this method works best with young babies ideally less than a year old. these tricks alone probably won’t work in older kids without some modifications. you can start these sleep-training ideas at any time. if getting a solid night’s sleep is a priority the younger you start training the better. first: baby has to get enough calories during the day. nurse frequently (at least every 2-3 hours by day) and start solid complementary foods at 4-6 months (earlier is not better). as babies get to 3-4 months of age they will be able to go longer between day feedings. don’t let them stretch out the day feeds until the night is one solid block of sleep. second: you must back off on reacting to every little noise babies make as they sleep. you will stir a bit baby will fuss a bit and you’re both wide awake. that’s a habit that needs to stop. as soon as you feel comfortable move your baby to his or her own room so you don’t keep waking each other up. if baby wakes and makes a little noise don’t rush in immediately. take your time. at least sometimes baby will put herself back to sleep without your going to see her. give her a chance to soothe herself before rushing to tend to her. third (and this is the hardest part for many families): baby must learn to fall asleep all alone. if you’re holding rocking or feeding a baby while he falls asleep and then sneak away the baby — guaranteed — will wake up again later that night and need you to come back. good rules of thumb: by two months of age you should sometimes be putting your baby down when awake; by four months of age you should usually be putting your baby down awake; by six months of age: always put your baby down while awake. some babies will make this easy essentially sleep training themselves. other babies will fight sleep and make this a more difficult transition. exactly when to sleep train is a personal decision depending on the parents’ plans and priorities."

    "Question": "how can i save money on my health insurance?",
    "Answer": "here's the new reality: we're all paying more for fewer health benefits. a 2010 employer health benefits survey conducted by the kaiser family foundation found that employees paid 14% more for family health coverage last year than just one year before. and an online survey just out from glassdoor. com found that cuts to health and dental benefits were on the rise during the last quarter of 2010 with more than 11% of employees surveyed seeing their benefits reduced in the past six months. what's driving costs skyward? experts cite a mix of inefficiencies within the health-care system a growing use of medical technology an aging population widespread chronic disease medical malpractice and rising prescription drug costs. all this has prompted many people to ask: \"how can i save money on my health care? \" here a few cost-saving tips to consider: negotiate. ask your doctor hospital or lab upfront how much your care will cost and then ask for a better price. to find out what's reasonable for the type of care you need you can use online tools such as healthcare blue book and vimo. be sure to ask your provider for the cpt code (common procedural terminology) that corresponds to the service you need so you can be sure you're getting an accurate comparison. some large insurers also make costs of care available to their members online. if the procedure you want or need isn't covered by your insurance plan (or you have no insurance) ask for the same rate the provider would give an insurance company. and make sure you get the agreed-upon rate in writing. most providers have their billing done by a billing company. you may need to show proof of your agreement to billing staff who didn't get the message from the doctor. pay cash: doctors like everyone else prefer to be paid right away for the services they provide. offering to pay in cash for your treatment prevents your doctor or hospital from having to bill you or wait for full payment. that convenience can put you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price on your care. watch your location: you'll pay more for the same lab work done at a hospital than you would if you had your blood drawn at a free-standing lab or your doctor's office. talk with your doctor about alternative and less expensive sites for treatment. review your bills. as i've talked about before. a large percentage of medical bills contain inaccuracies. always check for duplicate or inappropriate charges before you pay any bills. save on prescription drugs: be sure to shop for the best price on your medications because costs vary widely among different pharmacies. you can compare drug prices side-by-side among many pharmacies at both planprescriber. com and pharmacychecker. com. the national association of boards of pharmacy offers listings of online pharmacies it has accredited."

    "Question": "what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for parkinsons disease?",
    "Answer": "a diagnosis of parkinson's disease is based on your medical history and a thorough neurological exam. your doctor also may check your sense of smell. sometimes your doctor will have you try a medicine for parkinson's disease. if that medicine helps your symptoms it may help the doctor find out if you have parkinson's disease. there are no lab tests that can diagnose parkinson's disease. if your symptoms and the doctor's findings during the examination are not entirely typical of parkinson's disease certain tests may be done to help diagnose other conditions with similar symptoms. for instance blood tests may be done to check for abnormal thyroid hormone levels or liver damage. an imaging test (such as a ct scan or an mri ) may be used to check for signs of a stroke or brain tumor. another type of imaging test called pet sometimes may detect low levels of dopamine in the brain a key feature of parkinson's disease. however pet scanning is not commonly used to evaluate parkinson's disease because it is very expensive is not available in many hospitals and is only used experimentally. early detection for some diseases doctors can do tests to look for problems or diseases before you have any symptoms. this is called screening. but there is no screening test for parkinson's disease at this time. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer well as the patient you're always entitled to additional opinions about test results. so getting a second opinion in this case is a judgment call on your part. a second doctor probably could simply look at the ct films so you could get another opinion without having to be re-examined. your insurance may not pay for this however. that said i tend to trust my doctor. if your doctor said not to worry about this then personally i'd probably let it go. white matter lesions can sound scary and indeed they can be indicative of various scary diseases such as multiple sclerosis or dementia. but those diseases don't exist in a vacuum. if you had multiple sclerosis for example you'd have physical symptoms. studies do show that white matter brain lesions may be a normal condition of aging. i'm not sure the subject has been studied enough to say positively but certainly brain scans of older people with no symptoms of disease have shown white matter lesions. doc says don't worry so my advice is \"don't worry. \" hope this helps set your mind at ease! i am 58 yrs old and i was diagnosed with ms 2 yrs ago i have lesions in the white matter both periventricular and subcortial. dr order lumbar puch and found in my spinal fluid coating from nerve dymilation they said i have ms"

    "Question": "are some kinds of exercise dangerous when you have osteoporosis?",
    "Answer": "you know yourself better than anyone else. you know if you are likely to fall playing tennis or golf or any of the other sports that are not specifically forbidden for people with osteoporosis (like sky diving bungee jumping or ski jumping)! if you have played tennis for many years and have been safe then you may well be fine with continuing it. it is all a matter of risk. the problem with tennis is that you can fall slide and get hit really hard by a ball. maybe doubles is a better approach where your area of responsibility is smaller. on the other hand if you prefer to walk and work with weights that is great too! it is important to enjoy your exercise but to also be sure that it is safe."

    "Answer": "it's certainly possible you have dry sockets. however the fact you see \"black holes\" seems to indicate you have intact blood clots. on the other hand the bad taste you describe is consistent with a dry socket. however having such severe pain 6 days after wisdom tooth extraction seems unusual. i'd suggest you call your dentist to find out if this is normal. he or she may \"work you in\" with an appointment to take a peek and make sure you aren't having any complications. feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "epilepsy may develop even though you do not have any risk factors. a cause cannot always be identified. this is especially true in many forms of childhood epilepsy. for some people epilepsy can result from a tumor infection or damage to the brain. children and older adults are most likely to develop epilepsy but it can start at any age. it is possible that epilepsy may run in families but you do not have to have a family history to develop epilepsy. epileptic seizures occur when abnormal bursts of electricity in the brain briefly upset normal brain function. it's not always clear what triggers the bursts of abnormal electrical activity. conditions that can cause seizures include: head injury. stroke or conditions that affect the blood vessels (vascular system) in the brain. hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) in the brain. brain tumor. brain infection such as meningitis or encephalitis. alzheimer's disease. alcohol or drug abuse or withdrawal. tumors scar tissue from injury or disease or abnormal brain development may damage a specific area of the brain and cause partial seizures. but you may not have any of these conditions and still develop epilepsy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "how can i prepare for pregnancy if i am diabetic?",
    "Answer": "meeting with your health care provider before becoming pregnant is very important to ensure a healthy pregnancy. your diabetes health care provider can help you determine if your diabetes is controlled well enough for you to stop your birth control method. a blood test called the glycosylated hemoglobin test (hba1c) can help your health care provider evaluate how well your diabetes has been controlled over the past 8 to 12 weeks. having other medical tests before you become pregnant can help your diabetes health care provider monitor your health and prevent the development of diabetic complications during pregnancy. some of the tests your health care provider may recommend include: a urinalysis to screen for diabetic kidney complications. cholesterol and triglyceride blood tests. eye exam to screen for diseases common in diabetics such as glaucoma cataracts and retinopathy. a pre-conception counseling appointment with your health care provider is another important step in preparing for pregnancy. pre-conception counseling helps educate women so they can be physically and emotionally prepared -- and healthy -- for pregnancy."

    "Question": "not loosing weight exercise brutally and consistently! due to a recent stressful situation i became partially bald! . i am a 27 year old male with no prior medical illnesses other than allergies and colds. i exercise frequently and more than many people i know who are fit. i have been tracking my workouts for the past 2 years and have followed a million diets. i always try to make the healthier choice when i go out to eat (not often) and drink on occasion. from august 2014 - december 2014 i ran boxed lifted weights in combination and lost little to no weight. bp is 9<negative_smiley>72 and after exercise 115/90ish",
    "Answer": "you don't mention how much weight you have to lose. if you don't carry that much weight you might be at the place your body wants to be. your blood pressure is good but how about other health indicators like cholesterol? if you weight is too high you need to closely look at how much and what you are eating. do you eat mindfully by sitting down to meals and stopping when comfortably full? do you skip meals? how is your diet quality? research shows that exercise doesn't aid weight loss as much as diet. another factor is stress as you mention which can affect appetite. getting a handle on stress management can go a long way. here is more reading that can help: do you really need to lose weight? why can't i lose weight? hi for me if you was doing everything you say then you would be losing weight. but your not so your cheating its the only answer you need to as strict with what your doing as you say above do that and you will lose weight. but get on to some of these new ways of losing weight like the caveman. get out walking but brisk walking take a weighted back pack and when doing that find some hills to climb get up early go swimming these last two are some of the best ways to lose weight you just keep away from fast foods and junk foods and no sodas drink lots of water. all ways think of these self discipline. self control. breaking bad habits. in grain these in your mind. good luck"

    "Question": "what does it mean if i have blood in my semen?",
    "Answer": "blood in the semen is almost always nothing at all. it is a symptom of a small blood vessel probably breaking often during sex sometimes when men are bearing down with heavy lifting or straining sometimes with a difficult bowel movement if they’re constipated sometimes for no reason at all. so bright red blood in the semen speckled pink brown that happens. and unless it’s serious meaning it’s heavy and prolonged we just ignore it. it’s is not something to be worried about. it’s very scary. especially if you don’t know what to expect and suddenly you see blood in the semen then you panic. but it’s rarely a problem. now if you’re an older guy it could be a sign of prostate cancer or a kind of bladder cancer. but i’ve only seen that once in 20 years. it’s almost always nothing. in fact some of the major textbooks don’t even address the matter of seminal blood."

    "Question": "what happens to someone when they get malaria?",
    "Answer": "when you're bitten by a malaria -infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells. the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells. the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) generally ranges from: 1 9 to 14 days for plasmodium (p. ) falciparum. 12 to 18 days for p. vivax and p. ovale. 18 to 40 days for p. malariae. 11 to 12 days for p. knowlesi. symptoms can appear in 7 days. occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as 8 to 10 months with p. vivax and p. ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time. the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections. malaria can begin with flu -like symptoms. in the early stages infection from p. falciparum is similar to infection from p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale. you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria. common malaria symptoms include: fever. chills and a rapidly rising temperature. headaches nausea and extreme sweating. symptoms may appear in cycles. the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with. episodes of symptoms may occur: every 48 hours if you are infected with p. vivax or p. ovale. every 72 hours if you are infected with p. malariae. p. falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever. after the early stages life-threatening complications develop rapidly with p. falciparum and p. knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death. 2 if untreated you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with p. vivax p. malariae or p. ovale. malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby ( fetus ) and for young children. medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. infection with p. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p. falciparum malaria. visit the cdc web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling. malaria recurrences malaria caused by p. falciparum may come back (recur) at irregular intervals for up to 2 years if treatment is not complete. malaria caused by p. vivax and p. ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to 3 to 4 years but medication treatment can prevent relapses. p. malariae can remain in the blood of an infected person for more than 30 years usually without causing any symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "can stress cause my arms wrists and hands break out in an itchy rash before a stressful event?",
    "Answer": "stress is one of the known triggers of hives an outbreak of raised red spots (or welts) on the skin that often itch. hives are usually indicative of an allergic reaction but they can also occur as a result of sun or cold exposure infections excessive perspiration and emotional stress. it is not known exactly why stress may precipitate an outbreak of hives but it is likely related to the known effects of stress on the immune system. the medical term for hives is urticaria. developing an effective stress management plan may be able to help reduce the outbreaks if your rash is indeed related to stress. your doctor can also order tests for allergies that may be causing the outbreaks. there are a number of ways to ease the symptoms of hives including taking over-the-counter antihistamines to reduce itching cool compresses or baths wearing nonirritating loose-fitting clothes and avoiding excessive sweating direct sunlight and hot baths. if hives are severe your doctor may recommend taking prescription antihistamines or other medications to help control the outbreak."

    "Question": "how rapidly should one's body fat composition change with diet and exercise?",
    "Answer": "you can expect on average to lose 1% to 3% of your body fat per month but the range of loss varies widely between individuals because there are so many variables that affect body composition including age gender amount of body fat and muscle mass that you start with and a myriad of hormones that control how efficient your body is at storing fat and metabolizing it. unlike body weight where no more than two pounds per week of loss is recommended there are no standards or guidelines for how quickly to lose body fat or gain muscle because there hasn't been enough research to determine a healthy body fat percentage. you should also know that when you lose weight as much as 25% of the lost weight could be muscle. that is you could lose 25 pounds of muscle if you lose 100 pounds. the principle problem in terms of weight loss with losing so much muscle is that muscle is the metabolically active \"organ\" in your body that burns most of the calories and so losing it could slow down your weight- and fat-loss efforts. in fact losing muscle is one of the factors involved in weight-loss plateaus. the good news is that studies show that aerobic and resistance exercise can prevent muscle loss by as much as 8% and 20% respectively if you do it consistently three or more times per week. measuring body composition during weight loss is objective data that could prove as important as measuring weight. a bioelectric impedance (bia) scale can help you do that. bia scales estimate body fat by sending a very weak (and safe) electrical signal through your body and then measuring the resistance to the signal created by your body fat. fat is a poor conductor of electricity and so the more fat you have the more resistance there is. there is a 3% to 5% error possible with bia that depends on your hydration status time of last meal last round of exercise amount of alcohol in your system and some medications (for example diuretics). the error can be even higher than 5% so be sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines to obtain the most reliable estimate. you can find bia scales online."

    "Question": "i am 49 years old and have dry skin and pimples in the jaw line. can you suggest an effective acne remedy?",
    "Answer": "you may be suffering from hormonal acne. up to 50% of all women experience some form of adult hormonal acne the week before their period. some women are even more prone to adult acne because they have larger problems with androgens. these are women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. because the overabundance of androgens throws their monthly cycles completely off kilter they never know when they'll experience an acne breakout. most women who suffer from adult hormonal acne experience their worst breakouts on their chin and around their lips. adult hormonal acne typically begins after age 25 and occurs on and off during the course of adulthood. the bad news is that when a woman begins to go through menopause her female hormones begin to dwindle and those androgens become even more dominant. here comes the acne yet again. try washing your face twice a day with a gentle soap. there is no need to wash your face more often unless you are sweating profusely or have a very dirty job. salicylic acid found in a number of acne products works to dissolve the sebaceous oils helping to remove any skin debris that is clogging your pores. but be sure to rinse it off thoroughly. also find a very mild benzoyl peroxide cream something that is 2. 5% or less. when applied directly to the skin at night it can help unclog you pores as you sleep. try this every other night at first."

    "Answer": "you definitely need to get checked out by a gynecologist to make sure your body is capable of safely having a child. if you have trouble with sex (painful penetration? ) can you imagine how tough or dangerous it might be to have a baby's head going through there? please try to get over your embarrassment and ask a doctor. you'll find that they don't think you're strange they've seen everything they just want to help make sure you stay healthy."

    "Question": "what causes toxic shock syndrome?",
    "Answer": "the primary cause of toxic shock syndrome is a toxin produced by the bacterium staphylococcus aureus. two conditions are necessary: the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release toxins (such as a tampon saturated with blood menstrual sponge diaphragm or cervical cap that has been left in the vagina for a very long time). then the toxins must have a way of getting into the bloodstream. sliding a tampon into place in the vagina may make microscopic tears in its walls rupturing tiny blood vessels. a superabsorbent tampon -- especially if it's left in place too long or if it is used when the menstrual flow is light -- can dry out the vagina making such tearing even more likely."

    "Answer": "the chickenpox vaccine is a shot that can protect nearly everyone who gets it from catching chickenpox. the vaccine is made from the live but weakened or attenuated virus. viruses that have been attenuated are less virulent than viruses that are not. although the virus in the chickenpox vaccine is generally incapable of causing a disease it still stimulates a response from the body's immune system. that response is what gives someone who's had a shot for chickenpox immunity from the illness"

    "Answer": "there is no evidence that adipex interacts with birth control pills or that it makes you infertile. however women on birth control pills are at a higher risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. adipex can raise your heart rate and blood pressure which also increases your risk of blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. so be sure that the health care professional prescribing your adipex is aware that you take birth control pills and that he/she can monitor you appropriately."

(i do not have any runny nose stuffy nose or cough. not a cold! )",
    "Answer": "in an adult it is not necessary to mount a fever response to strep. some people do; most people do not. so you can still have strep. you were certainly exposed assuming your son was correctly diagnosed. any chance you can get a strep test? some clinicians will just treat symptomatic parental contacts but that would be totally up to the discretion of the clinician."

    "Answer": "hi i found this for you it may help in your condition ie i mean getting over your problem. its from the uk nhs. how long it is advisable to wait before you try for another pregnancy will depend on your specific circumstances. your doctor should be able to advise you when (or if) it will be safe to do so. in most cases it is recommended that you wait for at least two full menstrual cycles before trying for another pregnancy as this will allow time for your fallopian tubes to recover. however if you were treated with methotrexate it is usually recommended that you wait at least three months. nevertheless many women are not emotionally ready to try for another pregnancy so soon. your chances of having a successful pregnancy will depend on the underlying health of your fallopian tubes. in general 65% of women achieve a successful pregnancy 18 months after having an ectopic pregnancy. good luck"

    "Question": "is dish syndrome a real diease and if so what is it?",
    "Answer": "dish is absolutely a real disease/diagnosis. the condition has also gone by the names of marie-strumpel arthritis and forrestier's disease. . it is an acronym for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. in more simple terms it is a condition in which the body makes widespread (the diffuse part) exuberant extra bone around the spine and joints (bone spurs or osteophytes). the underlying cause is unknown (the idiopathic part). it seems to affect the spine more than other joints and leads to very large flowing bone spurs that often span from one vertebral bone to the next. this results in stiffness and loss of motion and is definitely associated with back pain. it is definitely different than ankylosis spondylitis (as) in that the pattern of bone spurs is not the same. unfortunately the heel pain spurs and other issues can be associated with both dish and as or may be due to degenerative changes if you are a runner etc. unfortunately there is no \"cure\" for dish or as. . the prognosis is that both dish and as tend to progress and worsen over time but that does not necessarily mean that your pain will worsen and your function will deteriorate. a good mantra for this problem is to \"minimize pain and maximize function\" understanding that both of these problems are systemic diseases that can't be completely fixed."

    "Answer": "hi found you this nice piece of info from <link> autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (apd) is a rare skin condition in women that recurs in a cyclical manner corresponding to their menstrual cycles. it is thought to be a response of the skin to the hormonal changes that happen just before menses. characteristically the skin eruptions occur during the luteal phase or the late pre-menstrual phase of the cycle. this is when the blood level of the sex-hormone progesterone rises. the skin rash happens as an autoimmune response to the body's own progesterone hence its name. within a few days of menstruation when progesterone level falls there is partial to complete resolution of the rash. it will recur during the next cycle. some patients have had previous exposure to external progesterone in the form of oral contraceptive pills. this is thought to pre-sensitize patients to react against their own internal progesterone. however not all patients with apd are exposed to previous hormone therapy. it has been postulated that these patients produce an altered form of progesterone that incites an immunologic response against it. in another theory progesterone is thought to heighten a patient's hypersensitivity response to another allergen. diagnosis. the diagnosis is usually made from the characteristic cyclical presentation. a skin-prick test with intradermal progesterone is helpful. positive tests with progesterone can be fairly rapid usually developing as urticaria within 30 minutes of inoculation or delayed with rashes peaking at 24-48 hours. provocative testing with intramuscular or oral progesterone can be performed as an alternative. skin biopsy alone is seldom diagnostic. a variety of histological features have been described. superficial perivascular mixed inflammation is the most consistent finding. treatment the skin problem is mild it may improve with topical steriod’s (for eczema) and antihistamines (for urticaria). severe disease may be treated with corticosteroids. the production of progesterone can be suppressed with hormone-based therapy. this includes the use of conjugated oestrogen (american spelling estrogen) ethinyl oestradiol (estradiol) tamoxifen and danazol. women with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis should try to avoid medications containing progesterone including the combined oral contraceptive pill minipill depo injections. the specific drugs to avoid include norethindrone norgestrel levonorgestrel. surgical removal of ovaries or oophrectomy has been shown to be curative in refractory cases. dop hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "aw poor baby! and poor mom having to go through this. i would not recommend self-treating this. i would do as the doctor said and wait to see how your son is doing in 5 days. your doctor has very good reasons for recommending your son's foot not be casted (immobilized) for a period of time. it's possible that immobilizing the limb by using something like a walking boot could cause muscle atrophy (shrinkage) which would be damaging to your son. if you have any questions about why your doctor recommended taking a wait-and-see approach then i'd suggest you call and ask him. in the moment of crisis when you're in the er and feeling anxious about your baby's health it's easy to forget to ask questions. your doctor won't mind if you call and find out exactly why he's taking this approach with your son. best wishes to you and the little one! i have a aircast on right night. what you might like about it is that it is designed to take away the moisture or air everytime he put's preasure on it. also the hard plastic sides actually feels good around because of the air flow but yet secure. that's hard to believe but it is true for me. i am still not walking. i probably tore something. but regardless this aircast did protect me and with only 2 straps it is easier for you to remove and put back on. also is designed to wear in a shoe. i could not tackle that but as a mother of a young boy i believe this is the better choice. that 5 day cast would make the transition harder for your child because it is so much heavier. if your concerns is based on protection. the aircast can do the job in my opinion."

    "Answer": "doctors define constipation as having a bowel movement less than three times per week. that doesn’t mean constipation is necessarily dangerous just that it’s then labeled abnormal possibly needing treatment. for people who are generally healthy constipation is almost never a serious health risk. so it’s difficult to answer the question of “how long can you go ” because if you’re generally healthy you eventually will go with few if any adverse effects. people for whom constipation can have serious health effects include: • the elderly especially those with dementia; • people with damage to the nerves controlling defecation such as hirschsprung disease or spinal cord injuries. a general rule is if you’re healthy and you’re not experiencing abdominal pain a small delay between bowel movements should be of no concern. from a medical standpoint stimulating bowel movements for their own sake (such as with “colon cleansing” or excessive laxative use) can have risks. constipation can result from hard stools and/or slow movement of the colon. for most healthy people with constipation simple treatments work: • increased fiber intake • bulk-forming laxatives (citrucel fiberall metamucil serutan) • stimulant laxatives (alophen dulcolax ex-lax and senokot) • stool softeners (colace correctol soft gels diocto surfak) a few people will need prescription medicines to help get their bowels moving. if constipation isn’t causing symptoms though waiting for nature to take its course is the best option. 4 to 5 days"

    "Question": "i am having chest pains shortness of breath hypertension fatigue and nose bleeds. what should i do?",
    "Answer": "high blood pressure (hypertension) causes heart disease which might explain your chest pains shortness of breath and fatigue. when the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently shortness of breath occurs as does fatigue. fatigue is also a very common side effect of many medications used to treat high blood pressure. nosebleeds can also be caused by hypertension. high blood pressure causes blood to leak out of the tiny blood vessels in the nose. unfortunately most people who have hypertension do not have symptoms. that is why hypertension is called the “silent killer” because the seriousness of this disease is not appreciated until hypertension has done damage to organs. your symptoms warrant immediate attention from a doctor. it is very important that your blood pressure be adequately controlled and that tests be done to evaluate your heart."

    "Question": "what are the side effects of treatment for brain tumors?",
    "Answer": "because treatment may damage healthy cells and tissues unwanted side effects are common. these side effects depend on many factors including the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. side effects may not be the same for each person and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. before treatment starts the health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help the patient manage them. surgery patients often have a headache or are uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. however medicine can usually control their pain. patients should feel free to discuss pain relief with the doctor or nurse. it is also common for patients to feel tired or weak. the length of time it takes to recover from an operation varies for each patient. other less common problems may occur. cerebrospinal fluid or blood may build up in the brain. this swelling is called edema. the health care team monitors the patient for signs of these problems. the patient may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. a second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. the surgeon may place a long thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. the tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body usually the abdomen. excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead. infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. if this happens the health care team gives the patient an antibiotic. brain surgery may damage normal tissue. brain damage can be a serious problem. the patient may have problems thinking seeing or speaking. the patient also may have personality changes or seizures. most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. but sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. the patient may need physical therapy speech therapy or occupational therapy. radiation therapy some patients have nausea for several hours after treatment. the health care team can suggest ways to help patients cope with this problem. radiation therapy also may cause patients to become very tired as treatment continues. resting is important but doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as they can. in addition radiation therapy commonly causes hair loss. hair usually grows back within a few months. radiation therapy also may affect the skin in the treated area. the scalp and ears may become red dry and tender. the health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems. sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. patients may get a headache or feel pressure. the health care team watches for signs of this problem. they can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. this side effect is called radiation necrosis. necrosis can cause headaches seizures or even the patient's death. in children radiation may damage the pituitary gland and other areas of the brain. this could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. in addition radiation during childhood increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life. researchers are studying whether chemotherapy may be used instead of radiation therapy in young children with brain tumors. side effects may be worse if chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given at the same time. the doctor can suggest ways to ease these problems. chemotherapy the side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drugs that are used. the most common side effects include fever and chills nausea and vomiting loss of appetite and weakness. some side effects may be relieved with medicine. patients who receive an implant (a wafer) that contains a drug are monitored by the health care team for signs of infection after surgery. an infection can be treated with an antibiotic."

    "Question": "do my 3- and 5-year-old children really need to get the flu/h1n1 vaccines? my chiropractor strongly suggests against it.",
    "Answer": "my advice is just the opposite – your children should be vaccinated for seasonal and h1h1 flu. the problem with the h1n1 virus is that it is affecting healthy young adults and children. we have especially seen a number of h1n1-related deaths in children if they have asthma. that alone should tell you that this is a very serious virus and if you have access to the vaccine you and your children should get it. each year thousands of children and adults (over 35 000) die just from seasonal flu. in my mind it is better to be safe than sorry."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer what kind of \"stuff\"? unfortunately i do not have enough information about this incident to determine if your pain on urination will resolve spontaneously but my guess (and it is a guess) is that the burning will subside in a day or so. if not you will need to see a medical provider for a proper examination and a urinalysis to see if you have an infection. right now you may just have traumatic urethritis so hang in there. keep everything out of your urethra. and hope that it resolves."

    "Answer": "hydrocodone is a potent pain medication that is highly-addictive. it would not be likely that a medical professional would prescribe this opiate as an antidepressant or so that you can feel euphoric and more energetic any more than a medical provider would give you an amphetamine to speed you up. even people with chronic pain should be wary of addicting themselves to opiates. never is this used as an anti-depressant. narcotics are quite the opposite they cause deptession. however getting rid of your pain would be enough to make you feel better. but you may find over time you will need to increase your dosage. is the addiction to narcotics a fair trade off? depends on the pain and you need to follow your physicians instruction to the letter don't increase your dose without talking it over with your physician."

    "Answer": "a skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling (palpating) it. a visual view is not necessary. apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from children! they are used to those tiny hard-to-find veins. i also had problems to see my veins. they turned me on my stomach and did the doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80% of the blood back up and found i have a hereditary absence of large deep veins. my deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically. wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe. she may have this abnormally strange vein size as well. i'm looking for answers myself. good luck. i also had problems to see my veins. they turned me on my stomach and did the doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80% of the blood back up and found i have a hereditary absence of large deep veins. my deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically. wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe. she may have this abnormally strange vein size as well. i'm looking for answers myself. good luck."

    "Question": "can mucinex dm and z-pack be taken together? . my son a college freshman likely has walking pneumonia. today his second trip to the health center in a week he was prescribed a z-pack for his symptoms: hacking cough fatigue fever and chills. his cough sounds alarming over the phone and is preventing him from getting much sleep. can he take mucinex dm to suppress his cough so he can sleep/rest?",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear your son's going through this and i'm glad he sought medical attention. \"z-pack\" is the common name for a particular dosing regimen of azithromycin which is an antibiotic. mucinex-dm is the brand name of a combination medication that includes an expectorant (which thins and loosens mucus in the airways) and a cough suppressant. it should be safe to take both the z-pack and the mucinex-dm at the same time. in telling you this i'm assuming your son has no known drug allergies. there are no known interactions between azithromycin and the ingredients in mucinex. best wishes to your son for a speedy recovery!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very unpleasant! a number of things could be going on here but it's not likely your gallbladder is involved. the gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage. it's doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder. i can think of any number of reasons you'd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a rotator cuff injury to an aggravated bursa. the only way to find out what's going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an x-ray. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider (pcp) to have this evaluated. it would be helpful to evaluate it when it's actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time. even if you're not having a pain episode your pcp might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment. best of luck to you! the main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest. this pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough. some people feel the pain in the shoulder. deep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worse. pleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity. this can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms: bluish skin color (cyanosis) coughing shortness of breath rapid breathing (tachypnea) pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. this inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisy. it may also occur with: asbestos-related disease certain cancers chest trauma pulmonary embolus rheumatoid arthritis lupus copied from:<link> when i have my pains it is in the middle of my back. it doesn't start on the right or left. it starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move. the only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieve's or 2 midol's. i had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything. they said it was my breathing but i can't remember if that was exactly the case. i lost 41 pounds but i could still feel the start of it but i would take medicine before it could go any further."

    "Answer": "i'd suggest you see a doctor about this. you can start with your primary care provider and he or she will refer you to an orthopedic doctor if necessary. you don't say exactly what kind of surgery you had in 2009. i'm thinking it was an arthroscopy to remove pieces of the meniscus. if this is the case and you're experiencing new or worsening symptoms you'd be well served to see a health care provider. i wouldn't necessarily recommend wearing a knee brace. you could reduce your range of motion and have a hard time getting it back. the only way to truly solve this problem is to get an examination by a health care provider. he or she can discuss with you all the various options from physical therapy to surgery that can help solve your knee problem. good luck! there are promising new treatments that are being developed using stem cells to stimulate cartiledge growth. your orthopedic surgeon is focused on surgery so he probably won't mention this and may not know about it. after having one successful knee replacement (arthritis) i'm biding my time till this treatment becomes available for the other knee."

    "Answer": "well that's an interesting question. vitamin e does possess some anti-clotting properties. some research does suggest that taking high doses of vitamin e (and i'm referring here to vitamin e supplements) can indeed contribute to hemorrhagic stroke. however the amount of vitamin e required to cause bleeding in the brain is not well-established and could be influenced by many factors including the individual's age and overall cardiac health. keep in mind also that taking other anticoagulants in conjunction with vitamin e could increase the risk of bleeding in general. for example combining vitamin e with a daily aspirin fish oil supplements krill oil supplements or prescription blood thinners like warfarin (coumadin) is inadvisable. it is my opinion that individuals should not put themselves on anticoagulant therapy. many people have heard that taking a baby aspirin every day is good for heart health for example. this may or may not be true. it would be better to consult a medical professional to find out if this type of therapy (or vitamin e or whatever) is right for you or not. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "does your hair grow thicker while you are pregnant?",
    "Answer": "some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about 90% of your hair is growing and 10% is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it <positive_smiley>"

    "Answer": "surgery for prostatitis may be necessary to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis that does not respond to long-term antibiotic treatment and that causes repeated urinary tract infections. surgery may be done to remove part of the prostate or to remove infected prostate stones ( prostatic calculi ). however this does not always cure the infection and it may make the symptoms worse. surgery is generally done only if all other treatments have failed. surgery choices surgical removal of part of the prostate to treat an infection that does not respond to antibiotic treatment or to remove prostate stones is called transurethral prostatectomy. what to think about removing prostate stones may not cure prostatitis because the surgery may not remove the portion of the prostate containing the stones. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is genital herpes?",
    "Answer": "herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (std) caused by the herpes simplex virus (hsv). hsv-type 1 commonly causes fever blisters on the mouth or face (oral herpes) while hsv-type 2 typically affects the genital area (genital herpes). however both viral types can cause either genital or oral infections. most of the time hsv-1 and hsv-2 are inactive or \"silent \" and cause no symptoms but some infected people have \"outbreaks\" of blisters and ulcers. once infected with hsv people remain infected for life."

    "Question": "what causes generalized anxiety disorder (gad)?",
    "Answer": "the exact cause of gad is not fully known but a number of factors -- including genetics brain chemistry and environmental stresses -- appear to contribute to its development. genetics : some research suggests that family history plays a part in increasing the likelihood that a person will develop gad. this means that the tendency to develop gad may be passed on in families. brain chemistry : gad has been associated with abnormal levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. neurotransmitters are special chemical messengers that help move information from nerve cell to nerve cell. if the neurotransmitters are out of balance messages cannot get through the brain properly. this can alter the way the brain reacts in certain situations leading to anxiety. environmental factors : trauma and stressful events such as abuse the death of a loved one divorce changing jobs or schools may lead to gad. gad also may become worse during periods of stress. the use of and withdrawal from addictive substances including alcohol caffeine and nicotine can also worsen anxiety."

    "Question": "monistat 1 for y. i. not working after 3 days. can i use a different otc and can i use yogurt or garlic at the same time",
    "Answer": "in general the answer is: yes. but let me clarify a couple of things. first are you positive you have a yeast infection? if the single-dose monistat hasn't improved your symptoms you may be dealing with something other than a yeast infection. you can probably try another over-the-counter product for yeast infection to see if that clears things up. but if it doesn't i'd advise a trip to the doctor for a good diagnosis. contrary to popular opinion eating yogurt with lactobacillus acidophilus cultures generally does not help a yeast infection. some women take lactobacillus acidophilus to help treat bacterial vaginosis but this is not useful. it's true acidophilus is the primary \"good\" bacteria of the vagina but research shows dairy-based versions of this bacteria generally don't have any effect on the flora of the vagina. also it's worth mentioning some women believe putting yogurt into the vagina will help cure a yeast infection. not true. don't do it. i've not heard of using garlic to treat a yeast infection. again i would not put it in the vagina. that could have serious negative consequences! hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of shingles and how is it diagnosed?",
    "Answer": "after an outbreak of chickenpox usually in childhood the virus that causes it stays in your body lying dormant in certain nerve cells. although your immune system usually keeps the virus in check anything that affects the immune system's ability to hold back the virus -- illnesses immunosuppressive drugs severe stress or aging-related changes for example -- can allow the virus to return with a vengeance. early symptoms of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching generally on one side of the body or face. for some people the pain is severe. it may be accompanied by fever chills nausea diarrhea and difficulty urinating. the pain and tingling are followed by a rash which begins with reddish bumps most often on the trunk. in a few days the bumps become fluid-filled blisters which usually crust over and fall off after seven to 10 days. even when the rash goes away the skin color at the rash site may be different. also nerve pain may persist at the site of the rash (a condition called postherpetic neuralgia). about one-fifth of people who get shingles develop postherpetic neuralgia. in most people the pain goes away within four months from the first sign of the rash. shingles is typically easy to diagnose. your health care provider will suspect shingles if you exhibit the typical symptoms of rash on one side of the body along with sharp burning pain and a history of chickenpox."

    "Question": "how do doctors diagnose osteoarthritis?",
    "Answer": "no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use a combination of the following methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other conditions: clinical history the doctor begins by asking the patient to describe the symptoms and when and how the condition started as well as how the symptoms have changed over time. the doctor will also ask about any other medical problems the patient and close family members have and about any medications the patient is taking. accurate answers to these questions can help the doctor make a diagnosis and understand the impact the disease has on your life. physical examination the doctor will check the patient’s reflexes and general health including muscle strength. the doctor will also examine bothersome joints and observe the patient’s ability to walk bend and carry out activities of daily living. x rays doctors take x rays to see how much joint damage has been done. x rays of the affected joint can show such things as cartilage loss bone damage and bone spurs. but there often is a big difference between the severity of osteoarthritis as shown by the x ray and the degree of pain and disability felt by the patient. also x rays may not show early osteoarthritis damage before much cartilage loss has taken place. magnetic resonance imaging also known as an mri magnetic resonance imaging provides high-resolution computerized images of internal body tissues. this procedure uses a strong magnet that passes a force through the body to create these images. doctors often use mri tests if there is pain; if x-ray findings are minimal; and if the findings suggest damage to other joint tissues such as a ligament or the pad of connective tissue in the knee known as the meniscus. other tests the doctor may order blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. he or she may also order a joint aspiration which involves drawing fluid from the joint through a needle and examining the fluid under a microscope."

    "Answer": "the surgical correction of a buried penis depends on the abnormality. however marked improvement can be achieved in almost all patients. the correction is based on re-establishing the connection of the erectile chambers of the penis to the penile skin along with the removal of excess pubic fat and/or skin. in severe cases of buried penis in which the patient has inadequate penis skin resulting from an overly aggressive circumcision or chronic inflammation then the penis must be freed and covered with a skin graft. the surgery is usually performed as an outpatient unless a skin graft is needed. the improvement in penile and pubic appearance can be dramatic. equally impressive is the patient’s positive personality and self-esteem improvement leading to more self-confidence and social interaction."

    "Answer": "one of the hardest parts about controlling anxiety is that severe anxiety can actually cause physical symptoms that lead to more anxiety. many of those with anxiety start to worry about their health because the symptoms can be so disabling that it's hard to convince your mind that anxiety could be causing them. this is often the case with vertigo. vertigo itself is not technically an anxiety symptom but dizziness – which is often confused with the idea of vertigo – very much is and it's actually a surprisingly common one. since vertigo is almost exclusively caused by hyperventilation the best way to stop the feeling of having vertigo is to make sure that you're not hyperventilating anymore. often this is easier said than done. in the middle of an anxiety attack it's very hard to re-gain control of your breathing. but there are tricks that make the process easier now the trick here is a nice brown paper bag this you put over you head and re-breath your output works all the time. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try getting your life together that would help cut down your problems."

    "Answer": "you're pretty close. the term ' ischemia ' refers to decreased oxygen delivery to various tissues. decreased blood flow can contribute to ischemia (since blood delivers oxygen) but ischemia can occur even with adequate blood flow. for example if something about your blood reduces its ability to carry oxygen molecules--such as anemia. ischemia can occur to any tissue. a few of the more-common types of ischemia are cardiac ischemia intestinal ischemia and even hip bone ischemia (also called avascular necrosis ). prolonged lack of oxygen to the tissue will cause the tissue to die. this is called 'infarction. ' in the case of the heart a prolonged lack of oxygen to the tissue will cause a heart attack or 'myocardial infarction. ' even brain tissue will die if it fails to receive enough oxygen. i hope this answers your question. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "hi i found this for you it’s a lot better than i could write its from this site <link> very early miscarriage very early miscarriage which is common - guessed at as up to 50% of all miscarriages - is a pregnancy that ends soon after implantation sometimes only a few days later. you may not even have been aware that you were pregnant. this early loss is medically referred to as a ‘chemical pregnancy’ and it would once have gone undetected with-out the ultra sensitive pregnancy tests now on the market making it easier to get a positive result 3 or 4 days before your period is due. if a home pregnancy kit showed faintly positive it was not a false pregnancy test it was evidence that conception had taken place. the medical term changes to ‘clinical pregnancy’ when a baby continues to develop normally but miscarries before it would be visible on an ultrasound usually at around 5 or 6 weeks gestation or within about a week of a missed period. when your period does arrive it can be put down to a late one and is usually heavier than normal so i think you had what they call a chemical pregnancy may have even been before you tested that’s why it was so faint from what was writen above. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds rather mysterious. i would suggest you see your primary care provider for an evaluation. since you have not experienced any trauma to the area there is no reason it should be bruised. that said many people do experience mild trauma they subsequently forget about. if you take over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or aspirin and then bump yourself you could very well get a mild bruise. at any rate the only way to determine why you are experiencing pain and bruising in your upper back is by examination. your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and might send you for imaging tests (like x-ray or mri ). on rare occasion something concerning like a major illness can cause the symptoms you describe. that's another good reason to see a doctor. it's unlikely you are experiencing anything serious but it's safer to rule out those possibilities. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "reasons that a pregnancy may be considered high risk include: maternal age. one of the most common risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy is the age of the mother-to-be. women who will be under 17 or over 35 when their baby is due are at greater risk of complications than those between their late teens and early 30s. the risk of miscarriage and genetic defects further increases after age 40. medical conditions that exist before pregnancy. conditions such as high blood pressure; breathing kidney or heart problems; diabetes; autoimmune disease; sexually transmitted diseases (stds); or chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can present risks for the mother and/or her unborn baby. a history of miscarriage problems with a previous pregnancy or pregnancies or a family history of genetic disorders are also risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy. if you have a medical condition it's important to consult your doctor before you decide to become pregnant. your doctor may run tests adjust medications or advise you of precautions you need to take to optimize the health of you and your baby. medical conditions that occur during pregnancy. even if you are healthy when you become pregnant it is possible to develop or be diagnosed with problems during pregnancy that can affect you and your baby. two of the more common pregnancy-related problems are: preeclampsia is a syndrome that includes high blood pressure urinary protein and swelling; it can be fatal for the mother and/or baby if not treated. with proper treatment however many women who develop preeclampsia have healthy babies. gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. women with gestational diabetes may have healthy pregnancies and babies if they follow the treatment plan from their health-care provider. usually the diabetes resolves after delivery. however women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. pregnancy-related issues. often a pregnancy is classified as high risk because of issues that arise from the pregnancy itself and that have little to do with the mother's health. these include: premature labor is labor that begins before the 37th week of pregnancy -- the point at which the baby is deemed full-term. although there is no way to know which women will experience preterm labor or birth there are factors that place women at higher risk such as certain infections a shortened cervix or previous preterm birth. multiple births means you are carrying more than one baby (twins triplets quadruplets etc. ). multiple pregnancies which are more common as women are using more infertility treatments increase the risk of premature labor gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix. the condition can cause bleeding especially if a woman has contractions. if the placenta still covers the cervix close to delivery the doctor may schedule a cesarean section to reduce bleeding risks to the mother and baby. fetal problems which can sometimes be seen on ultrasound. approximately 2% to 3% of all babies have a minor or major structural problem in development. sometimes there may be a family history of fetal problems but other times these problems are completely unexpected."

    "Question": "can migraines be prevented?",
    "Answer": "yes. you can reduce the frequency of your migraine attacks by identifying and then avoiding migraine triggers. you can keep track of your headache patterns and identify headache triggers by using a headache diary. recalling what was eaten prior to an attack may help you identify chemical triggers. stress management and coping techniques along with relaxation training can help prevent or reduce the severity of the migraine attacks. women who often get migraines around their menstrual period can take preventive therapy when they know their period is coming. migraine sufferers also seem to have fewer attacks when they eat on a regular schedule and get adequate rest. regular exercise -- in moderation -- can also help prevent migraines."

    "Question": "what's better for wrinkles man-made fillers or fat transfer?",
    "Answer": "in the beauty section of the los angeles times a recent article discussed how lines develop from not only sun exposure and aging but from animation. it talked about the treatments to deal with these lines. botox and dysport paralyze certain facial muscles and prevent the contraction that causes creases. we have a variety of fillers to plump the hollowness and grooves. there have been some recent additions including juvederm xc and hydrelle which contain local anesthetic to help reduce the pain during injection. however i will tell you that it takes a bit long for the painkiller to take effect and by that time the piercing of the skin is done. recently there has been some interest in stem cells that would augment fat transfer into the face. the article mentioned that “fatty tissue has the highest percentage of adult stem cells of any tissue in the body ” and that “adipose (fat) stem cells have the capacity of cell memory especially in the use of re-volumizing the face. ” my impression is that fat transfer is still not the preferred method because of the inconsistent results. sometimes the fat can shrink. sometimes it can get lumpy and that’s not what patients want. i prefer the man-made injectables because they have a very low incidence of lumps bumps and reaction. if they were to cause any trouble the filler will dissolve and disappear within several months. one of the doctors quoted in the article said “the difference between looking naturally beautiful and looking like a chipmunk is all in the technique. ” i wholeheartedly agree. the art form is as important as the product. technology alone is not enough to overcome lack of talent and judgment."

    "Answer": "no just the thc will cause a positive result and can remain in the system for quite a 2-3 weeks. omeprazole is not even close to the chemical structure of thc. there can be false positive drug tests but those are rare assuming it was tested at a good lab. webmd is incorrect in this instance. i know for a fact that omeprazole and all ppi's (proton pump inhibitors) can most definitely cause a false positive for thc. this is from several physicians (my own pain management doctor for one) and a relative who works for a testing firm that does drug testing for the federal government. yes prevacid or omeprazole can cause a false positive for thc. i tested myself at home in the a. m. and was negative for thc. i tested for the court in the p. m. after taking omeprazole (prilosec) and tested positive for thc. i called the company first check that makes the home test. they told me pantoprazole can cause a false positive but could not say for sure if omeprazole would cause a false positive. they recommend any positive test be mailed to them for mass spectometry testing which could rule out a false positive. twice i was jailed for testing positive and then was released after testing negative the next day when i hadn't taken omeprazole. only one time have i tested positive for thc at my pain clinic. i was extremely embarrassed and shocked! i am 52-years old and have not smoked pot since i was 19. i had just started a trial of omeprazole which my provider asked me about by name. i switched to another acid reducer at her suggestion and had no more problem. now i have done the rounds with these medications and it looks like omeprazole is all that's left. hopefully they will be reasonable. i have ulcerative colitis and gerd!"

    "Answer": "i can't answer that question since i don't know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results. i can tell you that about half of the women (i am also assuming you are a female) who have symptoms of a uti do not have them. many will have urethral irritation (usually from sexual activity) or even a vaginal infection. the culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better."

    "Answer": "the penis doesn't really shrink from the point of maximum penis growth (age 17 believe it or not) so if you are accurate in your measurement it is not due to the nortriptyline. some antidepressants can cause problems with libido or even make it more difficult to have an orgasm but it should not change the size of your penis. erections are all about blood; the engorgement of blood in your penis. as you may have experienced some erections are more rigid than others (more blood shunted to the penis). under the right circumstances with the right attitude i suspect that that lost inch will mysteriously reappear. don't fret. if you are worried about size you can always use one of those penis pumps. i have a friend who swears by these things. apparently the only issue with a pump is skin irritation so just make sure you use a penis skin moisturizer and you will be all good. man1 man oil is a solid one. hope this helps and good luck!"

    "Question": "why am i obsessed with eating disorders and losing weight? . i'm 16 and basically i hate the way i look and i hate myself for saying this but i want to be underweight. during the week i teat as little as i can and sometimes purge and also get guilty over eating a small amount but then at the weekend i tend to binge with barely any guilt. i research eating disorders and weight loss/exercise every night and it's the first thing i think of in the morning. i am obsessed with all to do with eating disorders and weight loss. why is this and what should i do?",
    "Answer": "i'm 18 and recovering from anorexia and bulimia. i have been at a stable weight for roughly a year and a half. when i was your age i became severely underweight and had to be admitted to an inpatient treatment center. all that you have written sounds exactly like how i felt and how i thought when i was suffering from the disease most. i would constantly research diet strategies exorcises and ways to cope with the depression that soon hit me. like you and all others that suffer from eating disorders i was obsessed. i became obsessed to drown out everything else. when i was thinking about controlling my weight i wasn't thinking about the painful things in my life. i hated the way i looked. no one had ever called me fat or teased me for the way i looked. but i was unhappy with my body because it wasn't exactly what i wanted to be. at the time there were many things in my life i could not control so i turned to controlling my body instead in addition to blocking out other painful thoughts by focusing on my eating disorder. it was very hard to recover and for a very long time i had no hope. however i promise it does get better. 16 is a very rough age. it is when you start truly becoming an adult and molding who you are. it is confusing scary and overall hard to handle. perhaps this is one reason you prefer to focus on your body and eating habits because then you do not have to focus on the other turmoil life throws at you. i cannot give you answers on how to recover but i can give you some motivation to seek help based on my experience. because i was underweight: i stopped getting my period. i still have not gotten it back. it is very likely i will never be able to have children. this may be the most devastating consequence of all. i lost almost half of my hair. it used to be beautiful and straight but now even many months after being at a stable weight it is thin wispy and unpredictable. due to lack of nutrition i still have not fully developed a woman's body. my breasts are small my hips are straight and i have little curves as a woman should have. it is very often i am mistaken for an age much younger than i actually am. i am an adult now however it is hard for people to see me as one as i look much much younger than i am. because i was sick: those around me suffered from watching me hurt myself more than i could ever understand. i was unaware at the time too engulfed in my obsession to realize their pain. my relationships have never been the same. some have simply changed in their dynamic but some are shattered beyond repair. i missed two months of school during my junior year while in treatment. some people are able to be effectively treated by a treatment team they visit a few times a week however my sickness became too severe for this type to be effective. those are two months of my teenage years i will never get back. tack on the 6 months i was severely underweight and depressed as a result of anorexia and that's nearly a year of my childhood lost to an eating disorder. much of my time today is still dedicated to recovering and fighting relapse. there are absolutely countless consequences of eating disorders. unfortunately your thoughts make it seem as though you may already be wrapped up in one. asking for help may not be what you want. it may be hard and maybe even embarrassing. however if i could tell my 16 year old self one thing it would be that help has always been hard to ask for but now than ever more important to seek. it took me months of suffering and unsuccessfully trying to recover to realize that i could not recover on my own. once i asked for help i found i had stopped feeling so helpless depressed and disheartened for i finally felt hope that i would get better. for me it took months but happiness does find a way to re-enter your life if you try to find it again. think hard not just about today but years from now as well. eating disorders put everything in your future at risk but getting help can make a world of difference."

    "Question": "how can insulin dosage effect cortisol levels. 88 yo diabetic checked for possible heart attack ruled out. was told insulin dosage may be too high causing cortisol reaction that caused his symptoms",
    "Answer": "cortisol plays an important role in human nutrition. it regulates energy by selecting the right type and amount of substrate (carbohydrate fat or protein) the body needs to meet the physiological demands placed on it. when chronically elevated cortisol can have deleterious effect on weight immune function and chronic disease risk. cortisol along with epinephrine is best known for its involvement in what the medical profession say in the \"fight-or-flight response and temporary increase in energy production at the expense of processes that are not required for immediate survival. let me see if i can clarify this: an individual or person is faced with a stressor a complex hormonal cascade ensues and the adrenals secrete cortisol then cortisol prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response by flooding it with glucose supplying an immediate energy source to large muscles. cortisol inhibits insulin production in an attempt to prevent glucose from being stored favoring its immediate use. cortisol narrows the arteries while the epinephrine increases heart rate both of which force blood to pump harder and faster. then this may cause the person to think he may be having a heart attack. the individual addresses and resolves the situation. hormone levels return to normal. in short the theory is that with our ever-stressed fast paced lifestyle our bodies are pumping out cortisol almost constantly which can cause problems on our health. our whole bodies are mediated by hormones and the immune system identifies cortisol as just one of many players. but if we isolate its role we can put into context the many complex mechanisms that lead to specific physiological damage. under stressful conditions cortisol provides the body with glucose by tapping into protein stores via gluconeogenesis in the liver. this energy can help an indiviual fight or flee a stressor. however elevated cortisol over the long term consistently produces glucose leading to increased blood sugar levels. ask your doctor for any information on diabetes and tell him what specifically you are looking for i am sure that they have the information. if you still are having problems ask your doctor to send you to a diabetic counselor or management counselor to help you to understand diabetes. i do hope you get to feeling better and please keep us informed how you are doing. thank you."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. dry flaky skin can be more than a nuisance. if the skin develops microscopic cracks it can let infections pass through. if you have flaky skin \"all over your body \" as you stated then one cause could be dehydration. as we age we tend to decrease our fluid intake. i'd suggest you make sure to drink several glasses of plain water each day. if you are being treated for high blood pressure or a heart condition you might want to check with your health care provider about how much fluid intake is best for you. but generally speaking drinking a few glasses of water per day is safe. if you bathe daily i'd suggest you cut back on that. we're hyper-hygienic here in the u. s. unless you're strenuously exercising you probably don't need a full bath or shower each day and that much bathing can dry out your skin. instead try a daily sponge bath with warm soapy water to clean your armpits groin/rectum and under your breasts. rinse and dry thoroughly. your use of lotion is a great idea. keep that up. use a \"bland moisturizer \" meaning something with little perfume. (you can get specific recommendations from a pharmacist or clerk at the local drugstore. ) thicker is better so look for something that comes in a jar. try not to scratch because this can lead to tears in the skin that allow bacteria in. i know it's hard (maybe impossible! ) not to scratch when your skin's that dry. but try to avoid it. i hope you feel better soon!"

    "Question": "why should i exercise after menopause?",
    "Answer": "exercise is effective at influencing your levels of total body fat and abdominal fat. the more active you are the less weight you are likely to gain. a national institutes of health review showed that people who participated in aerobic activities every day for 10 or more minutes had 6 fewer inches around the waistline compared to people who did not exercise. and exercising while you're in the process of losing weight -- as well as after you've lost it -- may be critical to maintaining weight loss. it's also good to remember that exercise has many benefits separate from weight loss and fitness. the list of exercise benefits is too long to include but here are a few benefits that are especially helpful after menopause. exercise helps: lower risk of osteoporosis. reduce risk of metabolic syndrome heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. keep joints and muscles strong. maintain good bowel function. relieve depression and anxiety. improve overall health."

    "Answer": "not hormonal but it could be just a psychological desire to have a family of your own. i agree that having a baby at 18 is premature especially if you have not completed your education. you will have plenty of time for a family later. after you have the \"infrastructure\" like a good supportive husband who is working - a stable relationshio a home to raise the baby and a career that is compatible to spending quality time with a baby. even little girls want babies. this is why they play with dolls so your feelings are normal. a wise young woman will have the wisdom to wait."

    "Answer": "it's definitely possible for a girl to get pregnant even if the guy uses a condom. one key piece of information here is: when did you put the condom on? if you inserted your penis in your girlfriend's vagina before putting on the condom it's possible you impregnated her. that's because pre-ejaculatory fluid (\"pre-cum\") can contain sperm. if one of those sperm got loose and found an egg it would make a baby. the only way to tell for sure if your girlfriend is pregnant is for her to take a home pregnancy test. i recommend she do this first thing in the morning when her urine is the most concentrated. you are correct that stress also can cause a woman's period to be late --or to skip a month altogether. there are many reasons for a woman's cycle to become irregular. pregnancy and stress are two of those reasons. by the way i applaud you for practicing safe sex. even if you believe you already know the correct way to use a condom i suggest you look over this brief information about it from webmd on how to use a condom. correct use of a condom can increase its effectiveness. wishing you all the best!"

    "Question": "how can osteoarthritis be prevented?",
    "Answer": "you can take steps to help prevent osteoarthritis. if you already have arthritis these same steps may keep it from getting worse. try to: stay at a healthy weight or lose weight if you need to. extra weight puts a lot of stress on the large weight-bearing joints such as the knees the hips and the balls of the feet. too much weight can also change the normal shape of the joint which can increase your risk for arthritis. experts estimate that every of body weight adds about of stress to the knee. 2 this means that if you lost just you could take of stress off your knees. be active. a lack of exercise can cause your muscles and joints to become weak. but light to moderate exercise can help keep your muscles strong reduce joint pain and stiffness and slow the time it takes for arthritis to get worse. for example if your quadriceps (the muscles in the front of your thigh) are weak you may be more likely to get arthritis of the knee. 3 for help getting active see: osteoarthritis: exercising with arthritis. protect your joints. when you can try not to do tasks that put repeated stress on your joints such as kneeling squatting or gripping. and try to use the largest joints or strongest muscles to do things. a single major injury to a joint or several minor injuries can damage cartilage over time. for example young adults who have had a serious knee injury are more likely to get arthritis. but they can prevent any more damage to their knee by wearing a brace to keep the knee stable and changing the way they do the activity. in most cases proper use of sports equipment and safe playing conditions can help prevent injuries. for ideas on how to protect your joints during exercise see: quick tips: exercising safely with arthritis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "does white tea have the same health benefits as green tea especially fat burning benefits.",
    "Answer": "both white and green teas come from leaves of the same plant (camellia sinensis) and are the least processed of all the teas. for this reason green and white teas have similar health benefits. green tea is used more in studies because it is readily available and more popular than white tea. the key difference between the two teas is white tea leaves are picked earlier (younger) and are less processed than green tea. the benefit is higher levels of antioxidants and polyphenols with research showing white tea may be the most effective tea in helping prevent cancer. i don't know of any studies showing that they are comparable on fat oxidation but i would assume it would be similar. so if you enjoy white tea drink away and reap the health benefits. for more on key differences in teas see this article <link>"

    "Answer": "i have had a similar problem with redness in my groin area where the pantie line is. but my doctor tells me that when i shower make sure i am dry down there. there is a powder that she ordered for me and it is called nystatin and it works wonders. my redness got better within 3 or 4 days. i have also used a antifungal cream that i got over the counter at my local drugstore and it is called miconazole. you can get this over the counter where you would buy the women products. i would put this on after i have bathe and dried the area that i needed to dry. and with a thin glove like you would use when you put hair color on i would rub a small amount into the area and i would do it again. then i would let it dry for about 5 minutes or so. then i would get dress. i would do this in the morning and at night for about a week and then it would be gone. i told my doctor about this and she said that i had a rash or a yeast infection cause i was sweating too much. and most people do sweat some more than others. if this problem is not better after trying this then i would definitely go to a doctor you trust or your primary physician if you haven't been to a doctor for this then go and see what the doctor says and if he or she says that it could be a yeast infection you can always buy something over the counter for yeast infection. but if you have a bacterial infection then you would need a antibiotic and that you would have to see your doctor. i wouldn't think that this is bacterial but it might be a good thing to go to your doctor just to make sure that it isn't something that you came in contact with. most of the time its not serious but they can tell usually by looking at it and sometimes it may have to be swapped. but if you do have a bad order or smell my guess is that it is yeast infection and you can get help and it will go away. i would say don't worry but i know you will and if this is painful itching redness with a bad odor and it may have pus then please go to your doctor. and if you don't have one then go online and see what family doctors you have in your city and check the reviews and see what other patients think of this doctor. i do. and it has helped me a lot. please let us know what you did and how it came out. i wish you the best."

    "Question": "does advanced pain relief interact with any other medications?",
    "Answer": "drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel \"blood thinners\" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval."

    "Answer": "the common tests used to diagnose thyroid disease include total t4 total t3 free t4 (not bound to protein) and tsh. t4 t3 and free t4 are hormones produced either in the thyroid or converted in the body from thyroid hormones. tsh is produced in the pituitary gland of the brain and is the control center hormone. tsh tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone should be produced. tsh is the best test to evaluate the overall functioning of the thyroid. so if the tsh value is below normal that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the tsh level is above normal there is not enough t4 t3 and free t4. of course if there is disease in the pituitary which is rare then the t4 t3 and free t4 are the informative tests. you should discuss your values with your doctor. as you can see from the values listed below there is a fairly large normal range for t4 and t3. as you mention your values are in the lower range of normal but as long as your tsh is normal your thyroid is working well. remember that you will want to find out the normal range for the laboratory used by your doctor. the values listed below are the usual ranges for most laboratories. the normal range are: tsh (0. 4 - 4. 0 miu/l) total t4 (4. 5 to 11. 2 mcg/dl) total t3 (100 - 200 ng/dl) free t4 (0. 8 - 1. 8 ng/l)"

    "Question": "what is diarrhea?",
    "Answer": "doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day. most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools. almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life. in developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe life-threatening dehydration. infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea. diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as \"acute diarrhea. \" most people with acute diarrhea recover on their own. diarrhea that lasts more than four weeks is thought of as \"chronic diarrhea. \" typically chronic diarrhea requires medical care to find the underlying cause and treat complications such as dehydration."

    "Answer": "hashimoto's is a thyroid disease so if your health care provider prescribed synthroid for it then that's the appropriate treatment. according to this webmd article hashimoto's is an inherited thyroid disease. the disease affects your thyroid gland's ability to produce thyroid hormone which is essential for proper functioning. because you were recently diagnosed you should understand it can take a period of time to regulate your thyroid gland appropriately. it takes about 3 months to assess the effectiveness of any dose of thyroid medication so you might expect changes to your dosage over the next year or more. your health care provider probably will monitor this closely in order to determine the appropriate dose of thyroid hormone for you. in addition your thyroid dose may change many times over the course of your lifetime. if you have questions about this don't hesitate to discuss it with your primary care provider or endocrinologist. the good news is that thyroid problems usually aren't life-threatening. with proper treatment you can expect to live a normal life. best wishes to you!"

    "Question": "how long does it take for all the swelling to be gone after cosmetic surgery?",
    "Answer": "all of us are anxious to see results. whether it is cosmetic surgery or building a home we like to see the work done and sometimes become inappropriately impatient. i often have to remind patients that with any operation it takes nature 100 days to do the basic repair work and absorb most of the swelling. whether that is an artificial hip replacement a hernia repair a breast reduction or rhinoplasty or septoplasty rhinoplasty with turbinate resection (which not only improves appearance but also improves the airway and prevents sinus problems) — it takes time for ole mother nature to do its job. we can’t rush nature; we can’t push the clock. we have to understand that this is what it takes to finish the job. you know the old saying “rome wasn’t built in a day. ” great noses are built in day. but it takes weeks or months for all the swelling to go down. now this does not mean that the nose looks hideous or is unattractive. typically within seven to 10 days the nose looks very good. but it continues to get better. it ripens like wine. swelling goes down. refinement sets in. the nose becomes thinner and more delicate less bulbous. but all this takes place a tiny bit each day. patients while told ahead of time that it takes weeks and up to a couple months for the appearance to optimize often become impatient and ask “what’s wrong? why is my nose still swollen? ” or “what can be done to make the swelling go away? ” we have to be frank and say to them that we cannot push nature beyond its speed any more than human beings can run faster than the fastest runner can run or make corn grow six feet in one week. there are certain limitations that nature imposes on all things human. however if the cosmetic plastic surgeon reminds the patient that the outcome will be better than it appears at a week or a month or two months or three months then hopefully the patient — and family – will accept that. just this week one of our cosmetic nasal plastic surgery (rhinoplasty) patients came in. prior to surgery she was an otherwise attractive young lady but had a crooked nose that was bulbous had a bump. too big for her delicate face. further it was turned down such that every time she smiled her nose almost hit her lip. the crookedness implied internal blockage and indeed she had trouble breathing because of a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates. to make matters generally worse she had some facial asymmetries which were also mirrored in the nose. that was another reason why it looked crooked. not the simplest of cases right? nonetheless the prospects for success were very good when we took on the case in june of 2009. the case went very well. “mission accomplished. ” we straightened the nose corrected the asymmetry took off the bump narrowed the tip. we raised the tip from the lip and prevented the nose from plunging with every smile. but the nose was swollen in the first week or two — perhaps a bit more than the average — but that reflected how much work was done. but after the second week things got better and three weeks later she was looking quite decent and could now appreciate the improvement. unfortunately the patient and her parents were a bit anxious and somewhat unrealistic about what it would take nature to deliver the final result. i kept assuring them that everything was on course that things were getting better and not worse and that nature would finish the job by adding additional refinements as the swelling was reduced. at six months the nose looked terrific but i knew it would look better even after a longer period of time. now in this case understand that because the patient has thick skin and such extensive surgery the complete healing period was somewhat prolonged. when she came in this week it was 13 months after the surgery. she looked fantastic. extremely happy. now a beautiful woman. since the last visit the nose had improved significantly over a period of months as predicted. yes it took nearly a year which is not typical (usually it is three to six months for optimization) but that’s what it took for this particular young lady’s nose. we had no control over nature. but we had trust. the important thing is to remember that once the result was in this teenager has it for the rest of her life. yes it takes some patience and fortitude to ride out the reduction of swelling and the further improvement. but when you think while it took longer than usual one year compare that to the lifetime of pleasure that now follows. maybe that wait wasn’t quite so long."

    "Question": "how are spotting and cramping early signs of pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "a few days after conception the fertilized egg attaches itself to wall of the uterus. this can cause one of the earliest signs of pregnancy -- spotting and sometimes cramping. that's called implantation bleeding. it occurs anywhere from six to 12 days after the egg is fertilized. the cramps resemble menstrual cramps so some women mistake them and the bleeding for the start of their period. the bleeding and cramps however are slight. besides bleeding a woman may notice a white milky discharge from her vagina. that's related to the thickening of the vagina's walls which starts almost immediately after conception. the increased growth of cells lining the vagina causes the discharge. this discharge which can continue throughout pregnancy is typically harmless and doesn't require treatment. but if there is a bad smell related to the discharge or a burning and itching sensation tell your doctor so they can check on whether you have a yeast or bacterial infection."

    "Answer": "if your goal is to eliminate your migraines by having a hysterectomy i have bad news for you. while female hormones may play a role in migraines this link hasn't been firmly established. many women who have had hysterectomies have migraines. to answer the other part of your question having a hysterectomy will remove your uterus so you won't have a period anymore. however if you leave the ovaries intact you will still have a hormonal cycle. in other words you may still notice changes in your mood on a monthly basis as long as your ovaries are producing estrogen. if you have your uterus and your ovaries removed you will go into surgical menopause. the symptoms of this are the same as regular menopause so some women opt to go on hormone replacement therapy to ease symptoms like hot flashes and trouble sleeping. i urge you to discuss your migraines with your health care provider. treatments for migraine continue to evolve. maybe your doctor can help you find a medication or other therapy that relieves your headaches. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "the goal of treatment of osteoporosis is the prevention of bone fractures by reducing bone loss or preferably by increasing bone density and strength. although early detection and timely treatment of osteoporosis can substantially decrease the risk of future fractures none of the available treatments for osteoporosis are complete cures. in other words it is difficult to completely rebuild bone that has been weakened by osteoporosis. therefore prevention of osteoporosis is as important as treatment. the following are osteoporosis treatment and prevention measures: lifestyle changes including quitting cigarette smoking curtailing excessive alcohol intake exercising regularly and consuming a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin d medications that stop bone loss and increase bone strength such as alendronate (fosamax) risedronate (actonel) raloxifene (evista) ibandronate (boniva) calcitonin (calcimar) zoledronate (reclast) and denosumab (prolia) medications that increase bone formation such as teriparatide (forteo)"

    "Question": "i'm dieting to lose weight. should i worry about falling short on key nutrients?",
    "Answer": "when you reduce your calories to lose weight you run the risk of falling short on key nutrients. that's why choosing nutrient-rich foods is particularly important when you're dieting. fortunately some of the foods richest in nutrition -- fruits vegetables and whole grains -- also happen to be low in fat and calories. they also tend to be higher in fiber. so they help fill you up even when you're eating less to lose weight. even on the healthiest diet however you may fall short on nutrients over time. the nutrients that are most often in short supply are iron and calcium. but if you're dieting to lose weight over an extended time you may run a risk of falling short on other nutrients. taking a multivitamin can help ensure that you meet your basic needs while you try to lose weight. but remember a pill is no substitute for a healthy nutrient-rich diet. “dieting” typically entails food restriction in both the amount of food as well as the type of food that you consume both of which could potentially lead to malnourishment if done incorrectly. the good thing is that the types of food that you should be restricting on a healthy diet typically don’t offer you much nutritional value anyways which is why you would want to restrict them in the first place. you shouldn’t have to worry about nutritional deficiencies when dieting so long as you’re eating a balanced diet with a variety of different foods and as long as you’re not following a very low calorie diet. be wary however of some diet plans that severely restrict certain foods or food groups altogether. some of these diets may have varying degrees of merit but it’s best to consult with a dietitian or doctor before undergoing major dietary changes to help distinguish between helpful and harmful dietary practices."

    "Answer": "yes shingles can definitely affect the eye. this is called herpetic keratitis and can be quite serious if not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively. steroid eye drops can make herpes in the eye worse so this is usually not done unless specifically prescribed by an ophthalmologist. antibiotic eye drops would have no beneficial effect on herpes involving the eye so special anti-viral/anti-herpetic drops are used. having chicken pox as a child is really a prerequisite to getting shingles; in the eye or other places. the chicken pox virus is also a herpes virus that has reactivated from a second exposure. i am pleased that her eye cultures came back negative."

    "Question": "what is meant by \"bipolar i\" and \"bipolar ii\"?",
    "Answer": "bipolar i defines patients with the classic form of this disease: recurring episodes of mania and depression. bipolar ii defines those who never experience severe mania but instead the manic episodes are milder and alternate with depression. a third term rapid cycling bipolar disorder defines those patients who experience four or more bipolar episodes within 12 months. this can include multiple episodes within one week or even within one day. this more often occurs later in the disease and is more common among women."

    "Question": "sick for 3+ weeks started with mild fever but turned into a cold which has grown progressively worse and won't go away? . the main reason i am concerned is because there is a rattling in my chest when i breathe out. it's like i can hear the fluid bubbling around deep in my chest. when i cough up mucus it is yellow. i don't have a fever. day quil helps reduces the cough for a bit but not the stuffiness. i've also been taking my allergy medicine. my sleeping pattern is not very regular but i get at least 8 hours a night. is this just a very prolonged cold or should i go to a doctor because of the rattling?",
    "Answer": "one must consider bronchitis and of course various types of pneumonia. these are the more common complications of a cold that worsens. colds typically last about a week so when you have prolonged and worsening symptoms secondary bacterial infections are a strong possibility. you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated --- three things unfortunately that cannot be done blindly over the internet."

    "Question": "what is the best way to stop hormone replacement therapy?",
    "Answer": "once you and your clinician have decided that it's time to stop what's the best approach? the simple answer is that we don't know. formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better. so the choice is really yours. the important thing is to know that women in general have about a 50/50 chance of experiencing hot flashes again (although maybe not as severe as initially) after stopping. some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones. after you stop take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you don't get the two effects confused. there are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you've stopped ht. if you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens. nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness. and you might want to ask about a bone density test. we know that women who stop ht often lose bone. depending on your bone density score and risk profile you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug (bone-sparing). at any rate discuss calcium and vitamin d supplements weight-bearing exercise and fall prevention with your clinician. another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping ht because hormones can affect \"lipid levels\" (both good and bad). and if you're taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid your dose might need to be adjusted. thanks for your reply!"

    "Answer": "yes it definitely can. spinal stenosis refers to narrowing of the spinal canal. the spinal canal is a narrow opening within the vertebrae (bones of the spine) that allow the spinal cord to pass through. when the spinal canal becomes narrow it puts pressure on the roots of the nerves that run from the spinal cord to various body parts. in the lumbar spine (which is located in the lower back) the nerves transmit sensation from the legs to the brain. if a nerve in the lumbar spine is pinched it can cause the legs (or a single leg) to transmit pain signals. if you've been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis your doctor should be able to treat your pain in the short term and suggest some ways to deal with the problem in the long term. i suggest you consult your doctor to find out what your options are. i hope you feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "there is a difference between preventing weight gain and losing weight. research shows exercise of about an hour a day is protective for weight gain during midlife. also resistance training is key to help maintain muscle mass because gradual muscle loss is part of the reason women gain weight with age. i guess the question is is your weight in a healthy range now? if it is it might not be realistic to expect it to stay the same throughout this time or lose it to be at a weight you used to be. if your numbers are good (cholesterol etc. ) and your blood pressure is normal overly focusing on weight may not be helpful to your health or quality of life. but if you feel the extra weight isn't good for you or you have risk factors than i highly suggest you see a registered dietitian. you can find one in your area at eatright. org also see weight loss menopause and exercise tips"

    "Answer": "what you're describing sounds like typical positioning for the laparascopic oopherectomy. as a former surgical nurse i helped position plenty of patients as you describe. i can't think of any reason why this positioning would aggravate your cervical spine or cause back spasms because the downward gravitational force on the spine while in the lithotomy position with trendelenburg (with the feet elevated 15-30 degrees) is lower than the force on the spine when walking for example. certainly if your surgeon anesthesiologist or circulating rn thought the positioning would aggravate your spine issues they would not have done it. in the operating room we take positioning extremely seriously are very careful regarding these issues. so sorry to hear you're dealing with the back issues and hope you can get yourself fixed up soon!"

    "Answer": "only your oncologist can answer this question. it's worth asking him or her too because depending on your cancer and its treatment you may be at higher risk for complications from h1n1 flu seasonal influenza and/or bacterial pneumonia. all vaccines depend on an immune system response to \"learn\" how to fight the bacteria or virus. if infection by that bug (like the flu) does occur later the immune system is prepared and quickly destroys the invaders before they can make you sick. as you may already know most chemotherapy suppresses the immune system. standard practice is to delay vaccination until the immune system recovers. there's no standard point to use and oncologists differ in their approach. they may wait for a certain period of time after chemotherapy or vaccinate when the white blood cell count climbs past a certain point. it's believed that this makes a good response to the vaccine more likely. other experts also recommend revaccination several months after chemotherapy is complete. generally speaking children's vaccines are given on schedule even while they are receiving chemotherapy. this information only applies to inactivated vaccines (including seasonal influenza swine flu and most others). live vaccines (measles-mumps-rubella varicella oral polio and bacillus calmette-guerin) should generally not be given to people receiving chemotherapy."

    "Answer": "over the years i've seen side effects from every medication we use for headaches. verapamil seems to cause the least problems as side effects from this medication tend to be mild when they occur and go away quicly when you stop it. most common side effect is constipation (probably 5% of my patients) and may 1 in 200-300 patients has puffy ankles from this. i've only had 1 in every 500-1000 patients (rough guess) get light headache or fatigued on verapamil. propranolol causes fatigue/light headedness in probably 5-10% of patients that i've tried it on and in some people can increase the chance of depression. on average topamax causes tingling in the hands in 50% of patients weight loss in 20% (not usually a bad thing) and trouble thinking in about 2%. (this is at the doses used for headache prevention) thanks for your reply!"

    "Question": "we are exclusive. she has been on the pill for months. we have both been tested for stds. is condom use needed? . we are both really ocd about pregnancy and stds that's why despite the fact that she is on the pill and has a cellphone alarm to ensure she takes it at the same time everyday and we've both been std tested we still have just used condoms. what is the risk of pregnancy if we didn't use condoms? is this reasonable to do? should i still try to pull-out?",
    "Answer": "the birth control pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy so as long as you both do not ever (now or in the future) violate your monogamous agreement you can decide to give up condoms and withdrawal. if you both have had prior sexual partners and not had a prior std and are now testing negative you are probably good to go. remember that no birth control is 100% (unless it is abstinence and sterilization). the 98% or so effectiveness from birth control pills can be improved a bit by using condoms as well but that will be your mutual choice. condoms can leak so your still taking your chances. most contraceptive pills put a disclaimer on the package guaranteeing only 99% effectiveness. pulling out is not effective as a small amount of semen might still seep in even when you pull out. my opinion: your best bet is to have a vasectomy and/or a tubal ligation. when both persons' accepted the risk. if educated already on safe sex. it is a decision of the two to be one team & one family. as a like the three branches of government. that is an both consider path of the two co-founders of the relationship. since this is now equal society. maybe we can create a birth control pill for the male. the female has been elitely taken more risk. in the past present & futures. as friends & family. our health is an on going issue to happiness. subdue various cases of changes. in ones lives that effects another. it is the key to being one's self & growth through out life. non educated or being careless are the more targeted factors of the spread all that comes with territory of having sex. parenting & mentors that are response to lead are just by the handful. who can reach the understandings of this base. sensitive subject among all life itself."

    "Answer": "yes the tax penalty is small in 2014 but it will increase in subsequent years. one reason to have insurance is to protect you against a catastrophic event such as a car accident or a cancer diagnosis. without insurance something like that could push you into bankruptcy. in addition there are other benefits of insurance such as access to free preventive care coverage for prescription drugs and coverage for doctor's visits. if your income is low you should check with your state's marketplace/exchange because you may qualify for federal assistance to help you pay the premium."

    "Question": "how is benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) treated?",
    "Answer": "there are several different ways to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph): watchful waiting is often chosen by men who are not bothered by symptoms of bph. they have no treatment but get regular checkups and wait to see whether or not the condition gets worse. medical treatment of bph is usually reserved for men who have significant symptoms. the available drugs include: alpha blockers relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and the bladder neck which helps to relieve urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate. side effects can include headaches fatigue or lightheadedness. commonly used alpha blockers in bph include tamsulosin (flomax) alfuzosin (uroxatral) and older medications such as terazosin (hytrin) or doxazosin (cardura). these drugs generally will lead to improvement in symptoms within several weeks and have no effect on prostate size. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors block the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into its active form in the prostate (dht). the prostate enlargement in bph is directly dependent on dht so these drugs lead to an approximate 25% reduction in prostate size over six to 12 months. for this reason improvement in urinary symptoms most commonly takes this long to occur. examples of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors include finasteride (proscar) and dutasteride (avodart). side effects of finasteride may include declining interest in sex problems getting an erection and problems with ejaculation. surgery or office procedures may also be used to treat bph most commonly in men who have not responded satisfactorily to medication or those who have more severe problems such as a complete inability to urinate. transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) has been used for the longest period of time. after the patient is given anesthesia the doctor inserts a special instrument into the urethra through the penis. with the instrument the doctor then shaves away part of the inner prostate to relieve the outflow of urine from the bladder. laser procedures: a number of laser procedures are available some of which can be performed in the doctor's office with minimal anesthesia. these procedures also involve the removal of obstructing prostate tissue. they are generally associated with less bleeding and quicker recovery than turp but may not be as effective over the long term in some men. microwave therapy: this procedure is generally performed in the office and involves the use of microwave energy delivered to the prostate to kill some of the cells leading eventually to shrinkage of the prostate. men should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each of these options. prostate surgery has traditionally been seen as offering the most benefits for bph but unfortunately carries the most risks."

    "Question": "how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy."

    "Answer": "the exact cause of peyronie's disease is unknown. in people whose disease develops quickly lasts a short time and goes away without treatment the likely cause is trauma (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. however in some people peyronie's disease develops slowly and is severe enough to require surgical treatment. other possible causes of peyronie's disease include: vasculitis. this is an inflammation of blood or lymphatic vessels. this inflammation can lead to the formation of scar tissue. connective tissue disorders. according to the national institutes of health about 30% of men with peyronie's disease also develop disorders that affect the connective tissue in other parts of their bodies such as the hands and feet. these conditions generally cause a thickening or hardening of the connective tissue. connective tissue is specialized tissue -- such as cartilage bone and skin -- that acts to support other body tissues. heredity. some studies suggest that a man who has a relative with peyronie's disease is at greater risk for developing the disease himself."

    "Question": "what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?",
    "Answer": "having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy-related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately more than 40% of pregnancies in the u. s. are unplanned and many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. public education is important to improve pregnancy planning. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience a weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving. women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well."

    "Answer": "if you're feeling discomfort from the kidney stone your best bet is to return to your health care provider and let him or her know. you didn't say when your stone was diagnosed but if the pain is a new symptom or if it's gotten worse since you were diagnosed then that's something your doctor would want to know about. if the pain is accompanied by a decrease in urine production i'd suggest you visit an urgent care facility. this combination of symptoms could indicate the stone is blocking a ureter which is the tube that drains urine from the kidney to the bladder. otherwise a routine appointment with your primary care provider may be enough. i hope you get some relief from the pain soon!"

    "Answer": "get a list of her medications. either look the individual side effects up on the internet or ask your friendly neighborhood pharmacist to assist you. many drugs used in the elderly can cause confusion and certain combinations of drugs can have many different side effects (called drug interactions). many internet sites will also check for drug interactions. some drugs are not biologically processed well by the elderly and can form toxic levels. these drug toxicities would not be known unless she had a blood level of the particular drug tested. this happened with my own mother who was unresponsive and presumed to be dying. with the care center asked to have all of her medications stopped we agreed. a few days after her medications were stopped she \"woke up\" and lived happily for three more years! she was on a seizure medication from an er physician for years based on his assumption that she had a seizure (she did not). the care facility continued to give her this drug on a daily basis to the point where it was at toxic levels. a blood test confirmed the toxicity and she was never given it again. stay closely involved in her care. if you have power of attorney you have the right to get this information review her medical records and talk with the physician that is covering the care facility."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer most sore throats are viral and do not require antibiotics at all. the only sore throats that need treated are the ones that are strep; proven by a lab test. a persistent sore throat can be due to allergy mononucleosis post-nasal drainage from a sinus infection or just from congestion where you are mouth-breathing. since i cannot examine you over the internet you will need to consult or see your medical provider again for another examination. looking for other causes. what it sounds like he is saying is that yes you have an infection but it's hard to tell right away if it's viral or bacterial. your doctor chose to try and treat a bacterial infection by giving you antibiotics. unfortunately for you it seems like it is viral which means you may not have needed antibiotics in the first place. they won't hurt you to have had them but they didn't really help anything either. viral infections just take longer to get rid of <negative_smiley> i just got over a really nasty viral infection myself. takes a while but hang in there! you're probably not even sick anymore <positive_smiley> is it possible that i never even had an infection and therefore did not require antibiotics? so it's possible that something else is wrong then?"

    "Answer": "i've experience that feeling and its usually because i didn't eat enough during the day before my workout and i pushed myelf too hard. if you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed. if you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect. i would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of protein/carbs/nutrients (try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll). give your food some time to settle (an hour or two) then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or vitamin water. try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well. if you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then i would see your doctor to make sure it's not something more serious."

    "Answer": "ringworm infection is caused by a fungus. fungi (plural of fungus) that cause ringworm live and spread on the outer layer of skin. ringworm is not caused by a worm or other parasite. fungi are present everywhere in our environment including on the human body. they thrive in warm moist areas such as locker rooms and swimming pools and in skin folds. you can get ringworm of the skin by sharing contaminated towels clothing and sports equipment and by direct contact with an infected person. ringworm is common among wrestlers probably because of the skin-to-skin contact. 1 ringworm of the skin (tinea corporis) is most commonly caused by the fungus trichophyton rubrum which spreads from one person to another. it can also be caused by microsporum canis which is spread by cats and dogs. this type is less common but causes more severe infection. people often get ringworm of the groin (\" jock itch \") by accidentally spreading athlete's foot fungus to their own groin area. people with athlete's foot also commonly spread it to their hands (tinea manuum). some people are more likely to get ( susceptible to) fungal infections than others. the tendency to get fungal skin infections or to have them return after treatment seems to run in families. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is in buttery-tasting pan sprays that make them taste like butter but without all the fat?",
    "Answer": "because you only spray on a thin layer cooking sprays are great for sautéing vegetables and lean meats with a small amount of oil. if you check the ingredients label you will see the primary ingredient is vegetable oil. while some are flavored to taste like butter others are flavored to taste like olive oil and may even contain some olive oil. here is an example list of ingredients in one brand of butter-flavored pan spray: soybean oil (adds a very small amount of fat) soy lecithin natural flavors dimethyl silicone (for anti-foaming) beta-carotene (for color) propellant. keep in mind that even cooking sprays labeled as \"zero calories\" can actually contain less than 1 calorie per serving. so they're not completely calorie free. you can actually make your own cooking spray by buying a spray bottle and filling it with healthy oil such as canola or olive oil."

    "Answer": "babies under three months of age have very little beneficial bacteria in their colon. consequently they will often be very very gassy (impressive in fact) as well as fussy. it is not your prenatal vitamins. this tends to miraculously improve after three months of age so keep using those gas drops and hang in there!"

    "Answer": "yes rigevidon is good for pcos. if your doctor put you on it then you need not worry about it. pcos usually happens due to body hormones estrogen and progesterone imbalance. so doctor usually prescribed birth control pills to patient as they contain both body hormones. so without fear go on with it and get at your doorstep from online pharmacy like meds247online etc."

    "Question": "could i still have lyme disease? . i was diagnosed 4 yrs ago. i never found a tick bite so i'm not sure how long i had it before i started antibiotics. i've never felt the same. i'm still just as tired and constantly achy in my neck and back. i get terrible headaches that last days. i get sharp pains in my arms all the time. i randomly get dizzy and i've fainted a several times. a year ago someone said it's allergies so i tried allergy medicines and just got sicker. in sept. i had mono. i'm 18 and i still feel like i'm dying!",
    "Answer": "to feel like you are dying at age 18 is very concerning. you should definitely consult your family physician and possibly see a specialist. persistent symptoms after lyme disease has been treated appropriately with antibiotics is a very controversial area. we do know that long-term antibiotics do not help and are associated with serious complications. we also know from recent studies that lyme disease does not relapse but you can get reinfected. the most common symptom of lyme disease is a classical rash erythema migrans and patients who get this rash again have another infection not a relapse. a small percentage of patients who are treated for lyme disease (10-20%) develop persistent symptoms which may last for 6 months or more. this syndrome is called post-treatment lyme disease syndrome (ptlds). according to the most recent advice from the centers for disease control (cdc) there are many fraudulent products claiming to treat \"chronic lyme disease\". so be cautious and make sure you are not being treated by quacks. treatment by a physician associated with a university teaching hospital would be a good choice. in addition to seeing your physician and making sure there is no other condition responsible for your symptoms the cdc recommends that you eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest talk to a counselor and keep a diary of your activities and symptoms. personally i found the answer to this above very misleading. although she mentioned the controversy but she did not tell you about the overwhelming evidence against the cdc's view point on chronic lyme disease. you are not alone your are not the only one receiving answers such as this one as to why you are still sick. you will see for yourself through the help of a lyme literate doctor that antibiotics can and will help improve your symptoms. you will also begin to find that no doctor with a closed mind will be able to help you through this. there is a group on facebook called lyme disease awareness go there and get the right information from 13k people just like yourself who have been denied long term treatment from doctors. i was one of those people. i had other doctors who said i was fine call these lyme literate doctors quacks. that quack gave me my life back! go to the columbia university tick borne diseases research center website at the top there is a second opinion option in one of the menus click it and go see doctor brian fallon and get your answers there or at lymedisease. org based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that i have come to know through a variety of venues (i am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience)- your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia (lyme) infection- and perhaps coinfections. i strongly recommend you review the international lyme and associated diseases (ilads) website for up-to-date and accurate information. because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians- like the \"expert\" who gave you horrible advice on this forum. if you have had lyme disease and did not take antibiotics until you were symptom free it will return - i know it happened to me because i could not get treatment i needed because of lack of knowledge from infectious disease doctors - long term lyme disease required iv antibiotics to penetrate the underlying tissues - you need to see a lyme literate doctor who has success in treating lyme disease - www. ilads. org i would look at the sentence under the answer. \" this answer should not be considered (good) medical advice and should not take the place of a (llmd) doctors visit\". i added the words in brackets."

    "Answer": "a couple of years have gone by since the center for science in the public interest first filed a complaint against the parent company (coca-cola) that manufactures glaceau vitamin water. and now the washington-based national consumers league has joined in by filing a formal complaint with the federal trade commission calling advertising and labeling claims on vitamin water products “dangerously misleading. ” as if the “names” of the various vitamin water flavors like “revive ” “focus ” or “defense” weren’t misleading enough health claims made in advertising have ranged from “supporting optimal immune function” to “reducing the risk of age-related eye disease. ” hopefully we all know that fortifying sugar water with various vitamins and minerals isn’t really going to keep us from getting sick or reduce the risk of disease. the best thing we can do for most of these health concerns is to eat a healthful diet rich in whole foods and plant foods get plenty of rest and wash our hands frequently. for example vitamin water’s focus drink features “vitamin a and lutein ” according to the label on the bottle. if you want some lutein one of the antioxidant-acting carotenoid phytochemicals that has been mentioned in research lately just eat some dark green leafy veggies green peppers corn avocados oranges tomatoes or parsley! and instead of drinking their defense drink with vitamin c and zinc just eat an orange broccoli (and other dark leafy green veggies) brussels sprouts berries kiwi cantaloupe papaya or mango for the vitamin c and some lean meats crab nuts and whole grains for zinc. here’s what we do know about glaceau vitamin water: each 20-ounce bottle is labeled as containing 2. 5 servings crystalline fructose is the true main ingredient accounting for about 33 grams of sugar if you drink the whole bottle. each 20-ounce bottle totals 125 calories. the bottom line: keep your eyes open when it comes to manufactured products making health claims especially those fortified with nutrients. remember that the best water to drink is still good old h20 — not water pumped with 50 calories worth of sugar per eight-ounce serving."

    "Answer": "if you suspect you might have a blood clot you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. you have a good grasp of the primary symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) but just because you don't have the redness and heat doesn't mean it's not a dvt. of course pain in one calf muscle doesn't necessarily mean you do have a dvt either. generally dvt is first assessed using a non-invasive ultrasound test. this imaging test will give your doctor a good look at your veins to see if one of them may be blocked or partially blocked. if you do have a blood clot in your leg your doctor may treat it with medications. best wishes getting this sorted out! i had an ultra sound and it showed a blood clot."

    "Question": "does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding?",
    "Answer": "running will burn more calories than the elliptical although it's pretty close (about 100 calories per hour difference). some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously. this kind of movement takes lots of energy. both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion (about 200-240 calories per hour more). in a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below. (the elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and cross-country skiing. it should be noted that rowing the elliptical and cross-country skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than 100-125 calories per hour difference among them. ) treadmill walking/running stair stepping rowing cross-country skiing biking (stationary) now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad. to the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them. you'd be hard pressed to say that lance armstrong isn't fit. he's one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking. the point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles aren't going to know the difference. bottom line is that you'll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity. one final note: there is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines. in some cases it can be as high as 25 percent (the machine overestimates how many calories you burn). there are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weight-loss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure."

    "Answer": "as a clinician we are not really sure who gave what to whom when it comes to chlamydia. our goal is just to treat our patient and treat the partner. doing an extensive investigation as to who brought the std into the relationship is really not something we do. clearly you were exposed by someone. whether he tests positive or not is really irrelevant at this point if you are both treated and both test negative again. the urine dna test is very accurate but like most tests few lab tests are really 100% accurate. there may be variables in collecting the specimen and processing it in the lab. chlamydia can be asymptomatic in both men and women so you could have had it for a long time. the important thing is that it was found and successfully treated."

    "Answer": "ask you ob about mucinex since there are many types and combinations. diphenhydramine is the generic name for benadryl. your ob can provide you will a list of safe medications you can take during your pregnancy. antihistamines like diphenhydramine/benadryl will not open up a stuffy nose. they are used to dry a drippy nose. try nasal saline sprays and a humidifier. colds are not the only thing that can cause a stuffy nose when you are pregnant. those raging hormones can also cause cold-like stuffiness."

    "Answer": "minocycline is an oral antibiotic. does it work for everyone and every case of acne? no it does not. is it effective for some cases? yes you bet. the only way you will know the effectiveness of this drug for you is to take it. if your acne is hormonal (large cystic especially on your cheeks) it probably won't help. after years of failed antibiotic treatments i finally researched on my own and discovered a study indicating that spironolactone helps hormonal acne. and it did! my dermatologist has even prescribed it to multiple other patients since i brought it to her attention. my skin has never been better. face peels and pdt treatments also help clear your skin and get rid of discolorations and scars good luck!"

    "Question": "when can a mammogram be done after breast reduction?",
    "Answer": "this is an excellent question - and one you should ask the surgeon who performed the breast reduction. when i served as a reconstructive surgery nurse the doctor i worked with recommended a new baseline mammogram 6 months after breast reduction surgery. breast reduction surgery changes the \"architecture\" of your breasts and causes scar tissue deposits to develop so it's important to establish a new baseline image for a radiologist to compare your results against in the future. by the six-month post-surgical mark all of the absorbable suture should have dissolved and not appear on the mammo image. also you should be sufficiently healed so the mammogram isn't overly painful. the guideline i've mentioned here may not align with your surgeon's preferences which is why you should speak to him or her. also my comments only pertain to uncomplicated breast reduction cases. if you have developed a lump or other lesion that requires investigation with a mammogram then you should not necessarily delay the imaging test just because you recently had a breast reduction procedure. you should instead discuss the situation with your doctor and move forward with the recommended testing. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what causes hypothyroidism?",
    "Answer": "the most common cause of hypothyroidism is hashimoto's thyroiditis. \"thyroiditis\" is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder. with hashimoto’s your body produces antibodies that attack and destroy the thyroid gland. thyroiditis may also be caused by a viral infection. other causes of hypothyroidism include: radiation therapy to the neck area. treating certain cancers such as lymphoma requires radiation to the neck. radiation damages the cells in the thyroid. this makes it more difficult for the gland to produce hormone. radioactive iodine treatment. this treatment is commonly prescribed to people who have an overactive thyroid gland a condition known as hyperthyroidism. however radiation destroys the cells in the thyroid gland. this usually leads to hypothyroidism. use of certain medications. certain medicines to treat heart problems psychiatric conditions and cancer can sometimes affect the production of thyroid hormone. these include amiodarone (cordarone) lithium interferon alpha and interleukin-2. thyroid surgery. surgery to remove the thyroid will lead to hypothyroidism. if only part of the thyroid is removed the remaining gland may still be able to produce enough hormone for the body's needs. too little iodine in the diet. the thyroid needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. your body doesn't make iodine so you need to get it through your diet. iodized table salt is rich in iodine. other food sources of iodine include shellfish saltwater fish eggs dairy products and seaweed. iodine deficiency is rare in the u. s. pregnancy. the reason isn’t clear but sometimes inflammation of the thyroid occurs after pregnancy. this is called postpartum thyroiditis. women with this condition usually have a severe increase in thyroid hormone levels followed by a sharp drop in thyroid hormone production. most women with postpartum thyroiditis will regain their normal thyroid function. problems with the thyroid at birth. some babies may be born with a thyroid gland that did not develop correctly or does not work properly. this type of hypothyroidism is called congenital hypothyroidism. most hospitals in the u. s. screen babies at birth for this disease. pituitary gland damage or disorder. rarely a problem with the pituitary gland can interfere with the production of thyroid hormone. the pituitary gland makes a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) which tells your thyroid how much hormone it should make and release. disorder of the hypothalamus. an extremely rare form of hypothyroidism can occur if the hypothalamus in the brain does not produce enough of a hormone called trh. trh affects the release of tsh from the pituitary gland. primary hypothyroidism is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland itself. secondary hypothyroidism occurs when another problem interferes with the thyroid's ability to produce hormones. for example the pituitary gland and hypothalamus produce hormones that trigger the release of thyroid hormone. a problem with one of these glands can make your thyroid underactive. sometimes an underactive thyroid that results from a problem with the hypothalamus is called tertiary hypothyroidism."

    "Answer": "actually your girl can get pregnant even though you're pulling out ejaculating and then cleaning off your penis. men emit seminal fluid prior to ejaculation and this fluid can contain sperm -- which can fertilize an egg if one is present. withdrawal (pulling out) is not considered an effective form of birth control. if you desire to avoid pregnancy (and also sexually transmitted diseases) you should consider using a condom whenever you have sex. used correctly a condom is a very effective form of birth control. see this article on how to use a condom. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "i’ve just gotten through reading a new survey detailing how women feel about the “o” word — obesity — as it relates to themselves their children family and friends. the good news is that most women agree that obesity is a major issue. this survey was unique because it’s woman-centric updating us about how women currently view the impact of obesity on their daily lives. the online survey was conducted within the united states by harris interactive on behalf of the national non-profit association healthywomen. from august 24-26 2010 1 037 women ages 18 and older participated. after reviewing the survey results a number of disconnects began to emerge. here are some highlights from the survey: 1. although 87 percent of women believe that there is a parental role in the cycle of obesity only 28 percent assign any responsibility to themselves. fifty-seven percent believed that a mother and father have equal influence on their child’s potential for obesity. reality: research shows that a mother’s obesity has a much great impact than a father’s on their child at all ages. mom’s are still primarily in charge of grocery shopping and meal preparation. kids tend to emulate their moms’ eating patterns. 2. one in 10 women surveyed recognized that if she were obese in her first trimester her obesity more than doubles her child’s risk of becoming obese. forty-six percent of women didn’t know if there was a mother-child obesity connection in pregnancy and 11 percent felt there was no connection at all. reality: research from harvard medical school shows that the more weight a woman gains while pregnant the greater the child’s chances are of being overweight by the age of three. currently one in five women is obese at the time of her baby’s conception which translates into 1. 3 million annually. 3. eighty percent of women believe that outside relationships can influence their becoming obese. seventy-two percent believe an obese family member can affect their obesity risk. sixty percent think that a spouse or partner will significantly impact on their becoming obese or not. less than one in three believes an obese friend can influence their weight. reality: research shows that a woman has a greater chance of becoming obese if her friend does. there is a less effect for sibling or spouse. 4. while 97 percent of women knew that obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes only: a) thirty percent knew that it was also associated with gallstones and infertility; b) twenty-five percent knew it could increase the risk of colon and breast cancer; c) and only 13 percent knew about the obesity-uterine cancer connection. the bottom line from this survey is that all women need to embrace and integrate these new facts into a “new normal” attitude about healthy lifestyles."

    "Answer": "hi a lot of what your saying points to a simple yeast infection apart from the pink discharge but if you have been scratching your vagina this could be from a small tear. so you have two choices one off to your doctor for some antibiotics to clear it up. or you could try the sea salt way its very simple you put 2 handfuls of sea salt into a warm bath let this water get inside you vagina do this twice a day for a week things should get back to normal. for more info just googel sea salt and yeast infection. do hope this helps. good luck"

    "Question": "what are the treatments for chickenpox?",
    "Answer": "most of the treatments for chickenpox are aimed at decreasing the symptoms such as severe itching. acetaminophen can be used to decrease the fevers and aches often associated with the initial presentation of the viral infection. children should never be given acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or aspirin-containing cold medications because of the risks for developing reye's syndrome (a severe acquired metabolic disease associated with liver and brain dysfunction and death). frequent oatmeal baths can decrease the itching associated with chickenpox. in addition soothing lotions and moisturizers such as calamine lotion or any other similar over-the-counter preparation can be applied to the rash. diphenhydramine or other antihistamines can be helpful in controlling the itching. always discuss these treatment options with your health-care practitioner. in addition to medications there are also preventive measures that are needed. for young children it is important to keep nails trimmed in order to minimize injury from scratching and to control the risks for secondary bacterial infections. lastly in some cases of chickenpox acyclovir can be prescribed. acyclovir is an antiviral medication that has been used to shorten the duration of the infection. this medication has only been shown to be effective if started within one to two days of the onset of the rash associated with chickenpox. most commonly this treatment is reserved for patients with other diagnoses that put them at risk for severe disease (severe skin diseases immunodeficiency)."

    "Question": "how can i make sure my child eats a healthy lunch at school?",
    "Answer": "school lunch programs are designed to provide nutritious lunches right? in theory that’s true. in reality it just doesn’t happen. having my own two kids attend public schools i have seen the menus and eaten at the school cafeterias. i’m sorry but i would really like to see the nutrition facts for the salisbury steak or the beef enchilada plate sometime. color me skeptical. and it’s no surprise to me that kids who eat school lunches are more likely to be overweight. according to a 2010 study from the university of michigan school lunch buyers eat more fatty meat drink sugary beverages and eat fewer fruits and veggies than kids who pack their lunch. the problem: healthy food choices may be in the lunch line but that’s not what the kids are selecting. so our job as parents is to a) make sure kids make healthy food choices in the lunch line and/or b) pack a healthy lunch for them. better yet let your child help pack his lunch. and when you pack that lunch aim for fresh food instead of prepackaged stuff. pack up an apple or banana instead of fruit cocktail or mandarin oranges. offer raw carrots and lowfat ranch dressing instead of a side of chips with that sandwich. and give a water bottle or lowfat milk as a drink. trust me it can be done. yes it takes some planning and grocery shopping. and yes we are all very busy people. but it takes less than 10 minutes before bedtime to pack a nutritious lunch."

    "Question": "how are migraine headaches treated?",
    "Answer": "treatment for migraines includes therapies that may or may not involve medication. nonmedication therapies for migraine therapy that does not involve medications can provide symptomatic and preventative therapy. using ice biofeedback and relaxation techniques may be helpful at stopping an attack once it has started. if possible sleep is the best medicine. preventing migraine takes motivation for the patient to make some life changes. patients are educated as to triggering factors that can be avoided. these include smoking cessation avoiding certain foods especially those high in tyramine (sharp cheeses) or those containing sulphites (wines) or nitrates (nuts processed meats). generally leading a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition adequate fluid intake sufficient sleep and exercise may be useful. acupuncture has been suggested to be a useful nonmedication therapy. medication therapies for migraine individuals with occasional mild migraine headaches that do not interfere with daily activities usually medicate themselves with over-the-counter (otc nonprescription) pain relievers (analgesics). many otc analgesics are available. otc analgesics have been shown to be safe and effective for short-term relief of headache (as well as muscle aches pains menstrual cramps and fever) when used according to the instructions on their labels. there are two major classes of otc analgesics: acetaminophen (tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). the two types of nsaids are aspirin and nonaspirin. examples of nonaspirin nsaids are ibuprofen (advil nuprin motrin ib and medipren) and naproxen (aleve). aspirin acetaminophen and caffeine also are available combined in otc analgesics for the treatment of headaches. examples of such combination analgesics are pain-aid excedrin fioricet and fiorinal. finding an effective analgesic or analgesic combination often is a process of trial and error because individuals respond differently to different analgesics. in general a person should use the analgesic that has worked in the past. this will increase the likelihood that an analgesic will be effective and decrease the risk of side effects. there are several precautions that should be observed with otc analgesics: children and teenagers should not use aspirin for the treatment of headaches other pain or fever because of the risk of developing reye's syndrome a life-threatening neurological disease that can lead to coma and even death. patients with balance disorders or hearing difficulties should avoid using aspirin because aspirin may aggravate these conditions. patients taking blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin) should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids without a doctor's supervision because they add further to the risk of bleeding that is caused by the blood thinner. patients with active ulcers of the stomach and duodenum should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they can increase the risk of bleeding from the ulcer and impair healing of the ulcer. patients with advanced liver disease should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they may impair kidney function. deterioration of kidney function in these patients can lead to kidney failure. patients should not overuse otc or prescription analgesics. overuse of analgesics can lead to the development of tolerance (increasing ineffectiveness of the analgesic) and rebound headaches (return of the headache as soon as the effect of the analgesic wears off usually in the early morning hours). thus overuse of analgesics can lead to a vicious cycle of more and more analgesics for headaches that respond less and less to treatment."

    "Answer": "postural hypotension is a common cause of an episode of temporary loss of consciousness or feelings of lightheadedness. postural hypotension results from changing body position from a prone supine or sitting position to a more vertical position. normally blood tends to pool in the legs due to gravity when a person stands up potentially reducing the amount of blood available to return to the heart. nerves to the blood vessels in the legs normally act to compensate for this pooling by constricting thus sending blood away from the leg veins and toward the heart. however poor tone of the nerves to blood vessels in the legs can cause this mechanism to fail resulting in a disproportionate distribution of blood to the legs instead of returning to the circulation so the brain receives less oxygen. as a result a person feels lightheaded and may even faint."

    "Answer": "that's a great question for your doctor. i'd say to wear them until your doctor tells you it's ok to stop. compression stockings are worn after procedures like hip replacement to help reduce the chance of a blood clot ( deep vein thrombosis or dvt ). dvts may not occur until a couple of weeks post-surgery so you should wear the hose at least that long. if you have any fluid buildup in your legs you also need to keep wearing the compression stockings. fluid buildup can be a sign of poor circulation which again can lead to the development of a dvt. so in a nutshell seek your surgeon's advice as to when you can stop wearing the stockings. and don't stop too soon! all the best to you!"

    "Question": "why is it important to diagnose prostate cancer early?",
    "Answer": "prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in american men and the second leading cause of deaths from cancer after lung cancer. the estimated lifetime risk of being diagnosed with the disease is 17. 6% for caucasians and 20. 6% for african americans. the lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer similarly is 2. 8% and 4. 7% respectively. as reflected in these numbers prostate cancer is likely to impact the lives of a significant proportion of men that are alive today. over the years however the death rate from this disease has shown a steady decline and currently more than 2 million men in the u. s. are still alive after being diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives. although it is subject to some controversy many experts in this field therefore recommend that beginning at age 40 all men should undergo screening for prostate cancer."

    "Question": "as a teen how can exercise affect my weight?",
    "Answer": "because exercise helps use up oxygen it causes your body to burn stored fat and helps you maintain a normal weight. for instance if you walk 4 miles a day four times a week you can burn about 1 600 calories or nearly half a pound a week. if you don't change your diet at all and keep walking the same distance over six months you'll lose 12 pounds. walk the same distance for a year and you'll drop 24 pounds! the neat thing about exercise is you don't have to do it all at one time. after all not many teens have time to walk 4 miles after school! but you can do 4 miles in short bursts throughout your day. here's an idea of how to work that much exercise into your daily regimen: take a 1-mile walk on a treadmill before school. then take a 1-mile walk around the track during school lunch period. take a 1-mile walk after school with friends or the family dog. take a 1-mile walk on the treadmill while watching your favorite show before dinner. if you stay with the walking program you'll see benefits with: weight loss muscle strengthening and definition stronger bones a lower heart rate better mood an improved complexion."

    "Question": "besides juvenile rheumatoid arthritis other forms of arthritis affect children?",
    "Answer": "along with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis there are several other forms of arthritis that can affect children and adolescents. interestingly these most often affect older children (greater than 8 years of age) and teenagers while typical juvenile rheumatoid arthritis most often affects young children. one type of childhood arthritis is the kind that affects teenagers who have rheumatoid factor-positive arthritis with involvement of the small joints in the hands and feet. rheumatoid factor is a blood-test finding which is present in most adults with rheumatoid arthritis but absent in most children with jra. it is present in this group because they usually are teenagers who have adult-type rheumatoid arthritis starting early. because it is starting early this is a worrisome group and these children need to be treated aggressively. often they will have lifelong arthritis. another form of arthritis that is common in this \"older\" group is spondyloarthropathy. this is a family of diseases in which the arthritis is the same but the associated problems are very different. the typical findings of a spondyloarthropathy are early involvement of the hips and other large joints. in addition these forms of arthritis tend to be asymmetric -- one side of the body is more severely affected than the other. the key finding is that these children not only have inflamed joints but they also have inflammation at the points where tissues attach to bone such as tendons and ligaments. often they have ankle or heel pain due to inflammation of the tendons inserting in the foot. in some mild cases the tendon inflammation occurs without obvious swollen joints. it is important to recognize the spondyloarthropathies as different from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis because the optimal treatment monitoring and outcome is likely to be different. in addition one must look carefully for evidence of the other diseases that can be associated with spondyloarthropathies. these include inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis reactive arthritis and behcet's syndrome. the most worrisome children with spondyloarthropathies are the hla b27-positive boys. they are at risk for developing ankylosing spondylitis. however most children with spondyloarthropathies seem to do reasonably well. in general for children who are hla b27 negative and do not have an associated condition the arthritis is more likely than jra to come and go repeatedly over a period of years but is less likely to be very severe or destructive. unfortunately we have only recognized children with spondyloarthropathies as being \"different\" since the middle 1970s so no good long-term follow-up data is available yet. sometimes children with a form of chronic skin inflammation called psoriasis can develop arthritis. this form of arthritis is referred to as psoriatic arthritis. occasionally there is a family history of psoriasis that can help clue the doctor into this diagnosis."

    "Answer": "it's not that the hospital is forbidden to accept children because of the affordable care act. the issue is that none of the insurance companies in your area have contracted with the hospital to provide care to members with your health plan. you can call your insurer to inquire about other healthcare providers in your area who can treat your child. you also do have the right to appeal and ask your insurer to cover the cost of care at the hospital if you feel you can't get the treatment needed elsewhere."

    "Question": "if i recently got over colitis should i skip taking the penicillin prescribed for my strep throat which is feeling fine? . i got a colitis infection on 11/26 after taking antibiotics to deal with a cyst on my hip. the colitis was treated but i got strep throat 3 days ago. i was prescribed antibiotics to treat the strep throat including penicillin which states on the bottle that it can cause diarrhea due to colitis. the strep throat is not particularly bothering me right now (my throat feels fine) so i am wondering if i should skip taking the penicillin altogether as i am afraid of risking another colitis infection.",
    "Answer": "your story illustrates why it's so important to give a complete medical history to your health care provider on each visit. i'm wondering if the person who prescribed the penicillin knew you had just gotten over a bout of colitis. if so then i would assume it's ok to take the penicillin. if not then i would suggest you call the prescribing physician tell them about your bout with colitis and ask about the penicillin treatment. in the case of strep throat antibiotics usually are given to shorten the period of time during which you're contagious. antibiotics also helps prevent the spread of strep to other parts of the body. there are many different strains of streptococcus bacteria; some of them are more dangerous than others. as i said your best bet is to ask the prescribing physician about taking penicillin after recovering from a recent bout of colitis. that way you will have a positive answer to your question. take care!"

    "Question": "i was getting my cycle every two weeks and today is cycle 21 and no period. negative pregnancy test can i be pregnant? . i was on depo and my last shot was 09/29/2015. i am currently ttc and in feb i started to take vitex and noticed my cycle was coming every two weeks so i discontinued use. in march i start dong quai to help regulate my periods and still the periods was every fourteen days. so when my last period started 04/13/16 i stopped the dong quai. now it has been 21days since my last period. i took two pregnancy test yesterday and they both were negative. did my period regulate or am i pregnant?",
    "Answer": "hi depending just how long you was on depo shop if it was like 4 years then it does take time for things to get back to normal for some women its been 2 years and over perhaps its just your cycle getting back to normal as i don't think you would have got to ovulating in that time frame. really for you its when your cycle gets back to the way it was then you should get pregnant then. good luck"

    "Question": "i am trying to get pregnant. the ovulation calendar needs an exact date my period ends. how do i calculate that?",
    "Answer": "charting your cycles and finding your fertile window can be confusing. the good news is that you are putting in the most important day the day your period starts. a period start usually coincides with the time that our ovary hormones are at there lowest when the cyst of ovulation from the last cycle has gone away and the body is just starting to pick our next cycle's egg. this is the most important date for your monitor. a period end date is much less helpful because length of cycle is affected by too many factors. i recommend continuing to do exactly what you are doing: enter the first day best guess on the last day or just let it calculate the date."

    "Question": "can i get pregnant after i've had an ectopic pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "yes. most women who have an ectopic pregnancy have subsequent normal pregnancies and births. if a fallopian tube had to be removed you can still get pregnant since the remaining fallopian tube should function normally. discuss the timing of your next pregnancy with your health care provider. some health care providers recommend waiting a certain amount of time (from three to six months) before trying to conceive again. taking time to heal both physically and emotionally after an ectopic pregnancy is important. above all don't blame yourself. counseling is available to help you cope with your loss. pregnancy loss support groups may also be a valuable resource to you and your partner. ask your health care provider for more information about counseling and support groups."
