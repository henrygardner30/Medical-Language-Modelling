    "Question": "can benadryl have a side effect when combined with suboxone?",
    "Answer": "both benadryl and suboxone can cause drowsiness. taking the two together can cause severe drowsiness. they also can both lead to constipation. taking two medications that have similar side effects usually intensifies the side effects. if you need an antihistamine while taking suboxone i suggest you talk to your pharmacist who can recommend on that does not cause drowsiness. suboxone is a controlled narcotic that is used in opioid dependency and addiction treatment and should not be combined with other substances because it can lead to dangerous side effects including respiratory distress loss of consciousness coma and death. you should tell your doctor about any other medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines) and any alcohol consumption as it may be possible to adjust the amount of suboxone to a safer level. the most common side effects associated with suboxone use vertigo and lethargy are intensified when the drug is combined with other medications and may also lead to an increase of the body’s tolerance and dependence to suboxone. this means that the body will require progressively increased amounts of suboxone. there has been a lot of controversy and debate concerning the use of suboxone with other substances. while most people understand that suboxone is used in opiate abuse and addiction treatment what they may not understand is that suboxone itself has the potential for dependency and has been the reason that many individuals on a suboxone regimen to have to undergo another detox. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility specializing in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility you may contact us at 855-338-6929."

    "Question": "i sprained my ankle over a month ago and i still have pains. . . i am sure it was over a month ago give or take a few days. but i am still experiencing pains in the back of my ankle on top and on the side some. i have went to the doctor and they did an x-ray and said things looked fine but since i am still having problems i feel like something else is wrong. could i possibly have a fracture or is it just a prolonged pain? .",
    "Answer": "an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain."

    "Question": "is there a reaction between smoking cannibis and taking vicoden?",
    "Answer": "well first i'm obligated to note that marijuana smoking is illegal under u. s. federal law even in states that regulate the use of medical marijuana. but as to your question: there shouldn't be any conflict between cannabis use and vicodin (hydrocodone). cannabis is not an opioid the way hydrocodone is. both substances provide mild pain relief so if anything cannabis might make you feel as if the pain relieving effect of the hydrocodone is enhanced. that said it's generally not a good idea to mix drugs with similar properties (such as pain relievers). so your best bet is to avoid smoking marijuana while taking hydrocodone. the hydrocodone should provide sufficient pain relief on its own. if it doesn't please contact your health care provider for a different pain reliever. there are plenty to choose from! hope this helps!"

    "Question": "is it dangerous for my infant grandchild to be exposed to shingles?",
    "Answer": "yes active shingles (herpes zoster) is contagious by direct contact and sometimes even by indirect contact (hands objects clothing etc. ) if the exposure is fresh. infants have a very immature immune systems so exposure to herpes zoster may cause chicken pox (varicella) the same virus. a child over one year is likely to have had the varicella vaccine and would be less vulnerable but a child under age one is likely to be at risk. it would be best not to have direct contact with the baby at this time at least until you shingles has completely resolved. as a grandparent you can certainly see the baby. shingles is not airborne. since shingles can appear on many different body surfaces (chest back face etc. ) it is best to keep this area covered if possible until the lesions have resolved. is it dangerous for my infant grandchild to be exposed to shingles?"

    "Answer": "it would depend on the type of ear infection: a middle ear infection or an external ear infection (swimmer's ear). yes it is possible. swimming with a middle ear infection especially if there was diving or underwater swimming could be painful. a deep dive could actually rupture an eardrum if you have a lot of middle ear pressure. swimming around on the surface of the water is not usually a problem. swimmer's ear (otitis externa) is often caused by water exposure so it is a good idea not to overly expose the ear canal to even more water until it has been treated. wearing a form-fitted ear plug may be helpful."

    "Question": "how much mild should a 12 year old girl drink per day",
    "Answer": "there is really no set amount but a pre-teen girl does need plenty of calcium phosphorous protein and all of those nutrients found in milk and milk products. these minerals vitamins and protein can be found in many other food sources if she eats them. if she was allergic to milk she wouldn't be drinking any so these other non-milk sources would be essential to her. if she eats cheese yogurt or even ice cream she is getting milk in another form so the bottom line is: milk is a good healthy source of many nutrients but an exact amount cannot be determined unless we knew what she was eating. personally i like milk but humans are the only mammals on this planet that continue to drink milk after we have been weaned. we like it but we don't necessarily need it if we have a good diet."

    "Question": "what are the risk factors for bipolar disorder?",
    "Answer": "scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. most scientists agree that there is no single cause. rather many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. genetics bipolar disorder tends to run in families so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. they help control how the body and brain work and grow. genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. however most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness."

    "Question": "what is shingles and what causes it?",
    "Answer": "shingles is a skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. this virus is called the varicella zoster virus (vzv) and belongs to the herpes family of viruses. after an individual has chickenpox this virus lives dormant in the nervous system and is never fully cleared from the body. under certain circumstances such as emotional stress immune deficiency (from aids or chemotherapy) or with cancer the virus reactivates and causes shingles. in most cases of shingles however a cause for the reactivation of the virus is never found. anyone who has ever had chickenpox is at risk for the development of shingles although it occurs most commonly in people over the age of 60. it has been estimated that up to 1 000 000 cases of shingles occur each year in the u. s. the herpes virus that causes shingles and chickenpox is not the same as the herpes viruses that causes genital herpes (which can be sexually transmitted) or herpes mouth sores. shingles is medically termed herpes zoster."

    "Question": "if one fallopian tube is defective can the other still be viable? . the left fallopian tube of my wife is defective can ther other be viable?",
    "Answer": "sure. the fallopian tubes operate independently so just because there's a problem with one doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem with the other. each woman normally has two ovaries and two fallopian tubes. the tubes catch the woman's egg as the ovary produces it and guides the egg down to the uterus. even if you removed one ovary/fallopian tube set the other set should still function normally. of course if a particular disease process such as endometriosis has caused one fallopian tube to become non-functional then it's possible the other tube is affected in a similar way. if your wife has any concerns about fertility and her fallopian tubes she should consult a gynecologist for an exam and further testing. i wish you all the best!"

    "Answer": "you are probably not pregnant if everything you say is true but they only way to be absolutely sure is to take a pregnancy test if you miss your next period or have any other signs of pregnancy. a headache or lower abdominal pains are not definite signs of pregnancy. as a matter of fact the birth control pills can contribute to certain types of headaches. lower abdominal pain could be many other things from constipation and intestinal gas to bladder pain. this should be investigated if your symptoms persist or worsen. if you truly worried about an unintentional pregnancy insist that your boyfriend to always use a condom. (no glove. no love! ). given a firm non-negotiable choice of no sex or sex with a condom most men will use one. your birth control pill is an excellent form of contraception but it can be near-perfect if you have him use a condom. too many people don't seem to realize \"pulling out\" does not prevent pregnancy! sperm leaks out before a man fully ejaculates. not to mention ejaculation isn't that controllable. also the birth control isn't fully effective until you have taken it a full week after your period. even this isn't a solid law. things like that are affected by too many aspects. for instance: how long you have been using the same kind of birth control your diet how easily your body flushes estrogen etc. etc. i suggest you more fully educate yourself on the reproductive system and safe sex practices. nobody can tell you whether or not you are pregnant. if you want to know for sure take a pregnancy test."

    "Answer": "let me set your mind at ease: your penis size sounds pretty normal. of course it depends on how you measured. this webmd article \" is my penis too small? \" explains exactly how to measure your penis and gives some statistics about average penis size. most men do not measure their penis length correctly so you may be in for a pleasant surprise if you re-measure after reading this article. even if your penis size comes up short let me assure you that while many men care a lot about penis size many women don't care about it at all. for women the loving intimate relationship she has with a man is far more important than the size of his sexual organ. take care! i tried all penis enlargement product. pills not working. only natural penis enlargement exercise working. i tryed it. i enlargement 1. 5 inch about in 4 month. <link> i would say normally it should be in between 3 to 8 inchs i tried all penis enlargement product. pills not working. only natural penis enlargement exercise working. i tryed it. i enlargement 1. 5 inch about in 4 month. look from here dude. you seem to be a rather small man which is ok. 4. 4 inches is ok for your size body. there is a possibility that you might grow another half inch. i believe that dicks can continue to grow until approximately age 25. unless you gain in muscle do not add body fat. as we age we tend to have a slower metabolism and the same amount of food we used to eat will no longer be burnt up by our physical activity. for each 20-30 pounds we gain we basically \"lose\" a half inch or so. you didn't say if you were gay straight or bisexual. learn how to use it and your smaller size won't matter as much. the average dick length for american males is 5. 0 inches so yours is not really that much smaller. i hope this helps you. roberto in texas."

    "Answer": "there is no doubt that ecstasy has a strong effect on nerves releasing excess levels of nerve chemicals (called neurotransmitters). in fact studies in animals have shown prolonged nerve damage after using mdma -- showing effects even 6 to 7 years later. it's safe to assume that it's not healthy for your nerves and could be worsening any nerve damage you have. in addition ecstasy has plenty of dangerous side effects -- it can even be deadly. mdma commonly causes confusion depression sleep problems drug cravings and severe anxiety. i would highly recommend not using ecstasy or any other drug. if you need help stopping since the drug can be addictive for some people talk to your doctor or a therapist about getting some help. the long-term effects of using ecstasy (mdma) far out-weigh any temporary relief an individual may gain. for example individuals may experience an increased heart rate and blood pressure chills and sweating nausea dizziness anxiety agitation depress and sadness. one of the more dangerous side effects from mdma use is dehydration. the drug can interfere with the body’s natural thermostat and prevent it from cooling internally and as a result the body can overheat. this dangerous side effect has led to cases of hyperthermia caused kidney and heart damage heart attack seizures and may be fatal. gallus detox centers is an inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Question": "we have seen a dr for my baby's very severe diaper rash and are using rx cream but nothing seems to work. she has had the rash for about 2 weeks in different states throughout. it has been the \"1 step forward 2 steps\" back sort of thing. she has open sores that have gotten to a point where they have shrunk but refuse to heal any more. she has also been on oral antibiotics for 3 days now. today the actual 'rash' part of it that we thought had finally gone away has resurfaced with a vengence. . please help with any suggestions.",
    "Answer": "i experienced something similar with my baby girl and the only thing that worked was this over the counter stuff called domeboro. it came in little packets that you just mix with water and soak their tush in. it was the only thing that would work and it helped immediately! i think you may be able to find it at walgreens."

    "Question": "once i’m stressed how can i calm myself?",
    "Answer": "one of the greatest things that i recommend for anybody is relaxation breathing. whoever thought a breathing exercise would be a terrific thing to do? it’s very simple. you learn it in less than a minute it might take you one minute to do you can do it any time during the day anywhere it will make you feel good. how do i do relaxation breathing? what i want you to do during this exercise as we are breathing in we’re going to breathe in hold a breath and breathe out through our mouths. when you do that i want you to think about the position of your shoulders the position of your ribs where your legs and hands are. i want you to think about those things. so we’re going to begin. you breathe in through your nose hold it for a count of five out through your mouth. remember you’re thinking about the position of your shoulders as they go up and down your ribs go in and out. you’re going to do that at least three times. we don’t want you hyperventilating remember it’s got to be comfortable for you. you gradually so you do it again alright nice and slow very slow. just think about the shoulders. do it 3 to 5 times. you can do it anywhere you can out to the water cooler. if anybody hears you they’ll think you’re sighing. that’s okay. you can go out the elevator go downstairs in the elevator by yourself. you can do it. you can go to the ladies’ room the men’s room wherever you want to do it. it’s so easy. you can do it at your desk. you can do it 10 times a day if that’s what you feel you need. you can’t overdo it as long as you don’t hyperventilate and that’s fine."

    "Question": "my 7 year old has been sick for a month - fever productive cough fatigue. three different antibiotics. what is it? . today the doctor said he had a clean exam but she acknowledges something is wrong. the fever had been hovering around 100 for the last several weeks but spiked to 103. 9 today. he had a chest crazy and blood work today. no results yet. what is keeping him so sick?",
    "Answer": "as much as i would like to help you it is really impossible to diagnose anyone over the internet without the benefit of a detailed medical history some diagnostic tests and of course a hands-on examination. many of these illness can be attributed to back-to-back viruses. this may be the reason he has not responded to the antibiotics. the chest x-ray and blood work may reveal a mild pneumonia so your answer may be forthcoming. in children viral pneumonia is also common."

    "Question": "should i be worried if i have symptoms of a tia occuring 5-10 times a month? . i have lupus. for the last 2 years i have been experiencing numbness and tingling on 1/2 of my face 5-10 times per month. i literally can feel a perfect line of numb vs. normal down my nose and lips on the left side. they have done mri's that have come out normal. now i am occasionally feeling numbness/tingling down my arm and leg also on the left side. i don't know if is should be worried or just chalk it up as \"yet another lupus symptom\".",
    "Answer": "hi i found this piece of info if this is you? during a tia one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries. it occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels. this can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonful's each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it. all very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength. good luck"

    "Answer": "keep the affected area clean dry and exposed to air (without clothes covering it) as much as possible. don't scratch or burst the blisters. if the pain keeps you from sleeping try snugly binding the area with an elastic sports bandage. for the first three or four days try ice for 10 minutes on five minutes off every few hours. later apply cool wet compresses soaked in aluminum acetate available over the counter in the form of astringent solution powder packets or effervescent tablets. to desensitize nerve endings crush two aspirin mix them with 2 tablespoons rubbing alcohol and apply the paste to the blisters three times a day. to cut down on itching ask your pharmacist to mix 78% calamine lotion with 20% rubbing alcohol 1% phenol and 1% menthol. you can apply this mixture continuously until your blisters scab over. other remedies for itching include frequent applications of vitamin e oil or gel from the aloe vera plant. dusting colloidal oatmeal powder -- available over the counter -- where clothes rub against your skin or taking a warm (not hot) bath with colloidal oatmeal may reduce pain."

    "Question": "prostatectomy = infertility? . if the spermatic cord is most likely severed or removed during the procedure (prostatectomy) does that mean i am infertile? . i am trying to confirm condom use to prevent possible pregnancy.",
    "Answer": "hi found you this info should help answer your question q: am i fertile or infertile after a radical prostatectomy? a: following a successful nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy most men will have return of erections but will not be able to have children by natural means. there should be no seminal fluid after the prostatectomy so they will be “infertile” by natural means but with in vitro fertilization techniques it is still possible for a man to father a child after a radical prostatectomy. storing sperm in a sperm bank before the operation is a recommended procedure for those men hoping to father children after the operation. unless your worried about sti's or std's do keep using condoms if not time to put them top the back of the draw and enjoy going skin to skin that you will enjoy all because no more fumbling for a condom. is this what your looking for in the way of an answer. good luck"

    "Question": "i have pigmentation on my upper lip. i am taking birth control pills. help! i look like i have a mustache.",
    "Answer": "i see this everyday in my practice and it's a real problem. this is a condition that's most likely called melasma. we used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill; so it's almost any contraceptive whether it's a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead. this gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this. so it's important to understand the underlying cause it's hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy. then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against. when i say protect i don't mean if you are going to the beach. if you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on. wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can. this condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat. what we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office. there are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it. but if you go in the sun it will come right back."

    "Question": "what steps are involved in preparing a tooth for a crown?",
    "Answer": "preparing a tooth for a crown usually requires two visits to the dentist -- the first step involves examining and preparing the tooth the second visit involves placement of the permanent crown. first visit: examining and preparing the tooth. at the first visit in preparation for a crown your dentist may take a few x-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. if the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth's pulp a root canal treatment may first be performed. before the process of making your crown is begun your dentist will anesthetize (numb) your tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. next the tooth receiving the crown is filed down along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. the amount removed depends on the type of crown used (for instance all-metal crowns are thinner requiring less tooth structure removal than all-porcelain or porcelain-fused-to-metal ones). if on the other hand a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage) your dentist will use filling material to \"build up\" the tooth to support the crown. after reshaping the tooth your dentist will use impression paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. the impressions are sent to a dental laboratory where the crown will be manufactured. the crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in 2 to 3 weeks. if your crown is made of porcelain your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. during this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement. second visit: receiving the permanent dental crown. at your second visit your dentist will remove your temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. if everything is acceptable a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place."

    "Answer": "there are different schools of thought about reality orientation and dementia. some believe that it is helpful to reorient a person with memory deficits and disorientation to reality when they cannot recognize their familiar environment or loved ones. they may take them to the mirror to point out who they are or show them a loved object hoping to \"jar\" their memory. in contrast others believe it is more harmful to impose our reality on a person who may be fixed in another space of time. they may become more defensive and frightened. deciding which is best for your loved one depends upon what works best. if reminding your mom when she asks about dad that he died results in greater suffering perhaps it is kinder to speak to her feelings: \"it sounds like you miss dad. let's look at that wonderful album of your honeymoon in niagara falls. \" by helping her reminisce with fond memories you are redirecting her from her sorrow and bringing her back to communicate with dad."

    "Answer": "inguinal hernias which occur when tissue bulges through the abdominal muscles and into the groin are caused by: an opening in the passage from the abdomen to the genitals (called the inguinal canal ) that should close before birth but does not. abdominal muscles that are weakened by aging and the daily wear and tear of life. conditions that increase pressure within the abdominal cavity such as frequent coughing or being overweight may contribute to the development of hernias. a femoral hernia sometimes mistaken for an inguinal hernia occurs when tissue bulges from the lower abdomen into the upper thigh just below the groin crease. the cause of a femoral hernia is often difficult to determine. if you do not have an inguinal hernia see information on other types of abdominal wall hernias. other types of hernias in the belly include spigelian incisional umbilical or periumbilical and epigastric. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "the penis doesn't really shrink from the point of maximum penis growth (age 17 believe it or not) so if you are accurate in your measurement it is not due to the nortriptyline. some antidepressants can cause problems with libido or even make it more difficult to have an orgasm but it should not change the size of your penis. erections are all about blood; the engorgement of blood in your penis. as you may have experienced some erections are more rigid than others (more blood shunted to the penis). under the right circumstances with the right attitude i suspect that that lost inch will mysteriously reappear. don't fret. if you are worried about size you can always use one of those penis pumps. i have a friend who swears by these things. apparently the only issue with a pump is skin irritation so just make sure you use a penis skin moisturizer and you will be all good. man1 man oil is a solid one. hope this helps and good luck!"

    "Answer": "in the u. s. 44 million people have low bone density (10 million have osteoporosis and 34 million have osteopenia). this amounts to 55% of the u. s. population aged 50 years and older. one in two caucasian women will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis in her lifetime. in the u. s. direct health-care costs from osteoporosis fractures amount to a billion dollars without even taking into account the indirect costs such as lost days at work and productivity. approximately 20% of those who experience a hip fracture will die in the year following the fracture. one-third of hip-fracture patients are discharged to a nursing home within the year after fracture. only one-third of hip-fracture patients regain their pre-fracture level of function. with the aging of america the number of people with osteoporosis-related fractures will increase exponentially. the pain suffering and overall impact on health and economic costs will be enormous."

    "Question": "how does perimenopause differ from menopause?",
    "Answer": "perimenopause is the 4 to 7 years prior to menopause. menopause is the cessation of your period for more than a year but perimenopausal women are still bleeding. they are having irregular cycles. they may be bleeding heavily they may be bleeding lightly very irregularly or very frequently but it is before the menopause. so the average age of perimenopause is about 46 whereas the average age of menopause is about 51. but women think that it's. i'm going through menopause when i have hot flashes and all that stuff. that's incorrect. you're going through perimenopause when you have that right. 80 percent of women have hot flashes during perimenopause. and it seems that once you go a full year without a period and you're now entering your post menopausal years your symptoms should improve."

    "Answer": "a cast protects and immobilizes a fracture so that it will properly heal. most people are casted for six weeks or so (depending on the type and extent of the fracture) so entire joints are frozen in place for a long time. when the cast is removed and the fracture has sufficiently healed those immobilized tendons and muscles will need to be gradually stretched back and strengthened again. it can take a few days or longer for your range of motion to gradually return to normal. be patient. it can be sore and painful to move that joint for a while."

    "Question": "what causes hair loss?",
    "Answer": "hair is susceptible to hormonal changes irritation chemicals and other damage. the hair follicles will experience shorter growth phases and the hair they produce will become thinner and shorter. aging is the most common cause of hair loss. in both male and female-pattern baldness (also called androgenetic alopecia) the growth period each hair follicle is shorter and the resulting hair is not as thick nor as strong. heredity will determine whether you will experience any degree of alopecia and it will also determine the age at which you experience it. certain disease states like ringworm can cause hair loss as can medications medical treatments as well as poor nutrition. people who routinely follow severe fad diets often experience a significant degree of hair loss. hormonal changes are also responsible for hair loss. during pregnancy women will have thicker stronger hair but after delivery will see a very significant loss of hair for about three months as their hormones restabilize."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer if your husband has known kidney stones and suddenly gets brown urine tis is most likely due to blood (older hydrolyzed blood; not the bright red blood seen in a fresh bleed). this could indicate the movement of a stone into the bladder or anywhere in the urinary tract including the kidney. stones cause inflammation and inflammation can result in bleeding. he needs to see his urologist again or at least have the urologist order a urinalysis. other causes of dark brown tea-like urine would be hepatitis but because of his stone history this would be highest on the list. so sorry to hear about the kidney stones and now this weird new symptom. it's always disconcerting when our body fluids change color! your husband should see his doctor as soon as possible. dark brown urine can be a sign of liver malfunction which could be caused by several things including medications. before you head for the doctor's office take note of the color and quality (firm loose etc. ) of your husband's stools. this information will help your doctor more quickly rule out possible causes for the brown urine. meanwhile your husband probaby should avoid consuming alcohol or acetaminophen (tylenol) just in case he's having an issue with his liver. if he has been prescribed a narcotic pain reliever such as oxycodone-apap he should weigh whether or not he can get along without it since \"apap\" is shorthand for acetaminophen. if you have any questions about whether any of his prescriptions contain acetaminophen you can speak to a pharmacist for clarification. i wish you all the best!"

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph?",
    "Answer": "many men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) have no symptoms. when symptoms (known as lower urinary tract symptoms or luts) occur they may range from mild and barely noticeable to serious and disruptive. the amount of prostate enlargement is not always related to the severity of the symptoms. some men with only slight enlargement have serious symptoms and some men with a great deal of enlargement have few symptoms. your symptoms may become worse during cold weather or as a result of physical or emotional stress. some medicines can make your symptoms worse. these include over-the-counter cold medicines such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( benadryl for example) pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (such as sudafed ) oxymetazoline spray (such as afrin ) and prescription medicines such as antidepressants water pills (diuretics) testosterone (gels implants or injections) and pain medicines (narcotics). the symptoms of bph may involve problems emptying the bladder or problems with bladder storage. symptoms related to bladder emptying include: difficulty starting a urine stream (hesitancy and straining). decreased strength of the urine stream (weak flow). dribbling after urination. feeling that the bladder is not completely empty. an urge to urinate again soon after urinating. pain during urination (dysuria). symptoms related to bladder storage include: waking at night to urinate (nocturia). frequent urination. a sudden uncontrollable urge to urinate. these symptoms are not always related to prostate enlargement and can be caused by other conditions. bph symptoms are often balanced between the two types of symptoms. if symptoms come on rapidly or if you have more of one type of symptom than the other type you may have another condition. other conditions that may cause similar symptoms include urinary tract infections prostatitis prostate cancer diabetes heart failure and neurologic diseases. you can use the interactive tool: how bad are your urinary symptoms from bph? to evaluate how bad your symptoms are and later to judge how well your treatment is working. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "is it safe to have cosmetic surgery while breastfeeding?",
    "Answer": "that issue revolves around what medication one will get during the procedure and whether or not these medications would enter the milk and then be passed to the infant. each medication that is given in the operating room and post-operatively has a history of whether or not it would be likely to enter into the mother’s milk. but frankly science is never 100% and i am very cautious and conservative. i don’t believe in taking any chances with the new baby and therefore i would suggest that if a mother is breastfeeding that the surgery be put off until breastfeeding is complete. the alternative would be for the mother to just stop breastfeeding for some period of time and not resume it until we are quite certain that all the medications have cleared from the system which is typically a matter of some days."

    "Answer": "if this happened only once and you didn't have any side effects then i would think its fine. however if you do it on a daily basis or even more that twice a week you may experience some stomach bleeding or even ulcers. ibuprofen is the active ingredient is motrin advil and others. if you do make a habit of taking motrin or advil and then forget and start drinking alcohol you could end up in the hospital. so be careful. you don't need ulcers or have your stomach to bleed. if you have other health problems ask you doctor about something safe to take and be sure that you do on occasion have a drink and want him to recommend something to take for pain that won't bother your stomach. taking any pain medication with ibuprofen can lead to blood clots high blood pressure and stroke and you don't need that. if you think that maybe you need to go to see your doctor then go. i know that people can do pain medication and then forget i know i have but i learned my lesson so please when you want to take something ask your doctor or ask a pharmacist. i do hope you are feeling better and please keep us informed and if you need any more help just let us know. thank you"

    "Question": "what is lactose intolerance?",
    "Answer": "lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the sugar in milk lactose. milk is an important source of nutrition for children and even some adults. with normal lactose tolerance all of the lactose is broken down (digested) in the intestine by an enzyme into two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which then are absorbed into the body. as a result normally no lactose reaches the colon. on the other hand in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. the bacteria produce chemicals that cause diarrhea and also produce gas. abdominal pain also may occur."

    "Answer": "assuming you do have shingles (your description was not convincing) a person must have had chicken pox in the past. a new exposure to someone with chicken pox may give you shingles (herpes zoster). since chicken pox is contagious a day before many people do not know who exposed them 2 or 3 weeks prior. chicken pox (varicella) is very contagious by direct contact or fomites (objects contaminated by the varicella virus. shingles is really the same virus but fortunately not as contagious. one can get it by direct exposure however."

    "Answer": "no not really. i mean it's best to take all medications on a close schedule. in other words if a medication is taken \"once every 24 hours\" (or \"daily\") it's a good idea to try to take it exactly every 24 hours. but as nurses our guideline is you can administer a medication within a one-hour window on either side of the appointed time and still be considered \"on schedule. \" that means you could take the blood pressure pill at the 23-hour mark or the 25-hour mark and still be considered \"on schedule. \" but honestly take a daily pill within a four-hour window probably isn't going to cause any problems. i would try not to make a habit of it. but if that's what works for you today you should be fine. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "when i drink milk i emmediatly volmit\"within 5 min\". could this be lactose intolerance.",
    "Answer": "it's possible though lactose intolerance usually presents as bloating and diarrhea rather than vomiting. this is because lactose intolerance is caused by low production of an enzyme in the gut not in the stomach. as long as you're not having any food allergy symptoms such as hives or difficulty breathing after you drink milk you can try eating a different dairy product such as ice cream to see if it also causes you to vomit or if it gives you diarrhea. you also may try eliminating all dairy foods from your diet to see if that solves the problem. if you continue to have symptoms when you drink milk you can always see your primary care provider for further analysis. other conditions could cause this response besides lactose intolerance. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "we know about some of the vitamins and supplements. there is very limited data in this category. the fda oversees it a little bit but it's really not strictly overseen and there is not a lot of clinical trials. so as pharmacists we have some reference materials there are some things called the german commission e studies which were actually done on a variety of different vitamins but the supplements are a little bit harder and as more-and-more people take these and incorporate that into their daily lives we are finding out that they may not be as safe as we thought. they may interact with medications some of the fillers or sugars people are getting allergic reactions to. they may cause rises in blood pressure. so we want patients to understand that they need to exercise and caution when it comes to this category and also find out whether or not their doctor wants them to take this. i only say when a patient comes and they ask me should i'd be taking this vitamin? i ask them if they recently had a physical and have they had blood work to find out if they are deficient in certain vitamins and is this particular supplement necessary? they are over-the-counter we think that they are natural they are safer not necessarily but talk to your pharmacist proceed with caution follow the directions exactly as you are supposed to take them and make sure that everybody knows your pharmacists your doctor or healthcare provider. it should be included on your medication list as well. so if you go to any different pharmacies or any different doctors don't know what you are taking to."

    "Answer": "absolutely. cardio exercise including aerobics is one of the best things you can do to lose belly fat and fat anywhere. strive for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise (aerobics fast walking/jogging elliptical biking etc) at least 5 days per week. on a 10-point scale moderate means you're working at about a level 5 or 6. if you don't have this much time you can pump up the intensity to vigorous exercise and slim down the time to 20 minutes and get the same benefit. vigorous exercise would be a 7 to 8 on a 10-point scale. in fact if you do vigorous exercise 3 days a week should do the trick. of course the more you do the more fat and calories you'll burn. interval training is a great way to get your body used to vigorous exercise. to start do 2 minutes of moderate alternating with 30 seconds of vigorous for 20 minutes. as you get in better shape you can increase the vigorous exercise time. good luck!"

    "Question": "can losing sleep now affect the rest of my life?",
    "Answer": "anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimer’s knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and it’s often anyone’s guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (let’s call it rbd for short). the facts: * with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to “act out” your dreams. translation: you’re not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep. * these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: you’re not getting the restful sleep you need. * rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson’s disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. it’s not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinson’s as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinson’s disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? we’ve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia — eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise — both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good night’s sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking: * one in three people over 65 will die with dementia. * twenty percent of us don’t get enough sleep — banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average. * heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly “harmless” struggle to get a good night’s sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep."

    "Answer": "bacterial vaginosis is a mild infection of the vagina caused by bacteria. normally there are a lot of \"good\" bacteria and some \"bad\" bacteria in the vagina. the good types help control the growth of the bad types. in women with bacterial vaginosis the balance is upset. there are not enough good bacteria and too many bad bacteria. bacterial vaginosis is usually a mild problem that may go away on its own in a few days. but it can lead to more serious problems so it’s a good idea to see your doctor and get treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is a normal platelet count?",
    "Answer": "platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. a normal platelet count is between 150 000 and 450 000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter abbreviated mcl). the average platelet count is 237 000 per mcl in men and 266 000 per mcl in women. a platelet count below 150 000 per mcl is called thrombocytopenia while a platelet count over 450 000 is called thrombocytosis. platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50 000 per mcl (assuming no other problems are present). spontaneous bleeding doesn’t usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10 000 or 20 000 per mcl. platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. a low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition. for this reason high or low platelet counts require additional medical attention. 329"

    "Answer": "insomnia in children is quite common. it can become very problematic for parents as this disturbs their sleep as well. often the children do not seem too bothered by their insomnia. there can be many causes for this type of insomnia. use of caffeine refined sugars and heavy meals particularly at night can cause this problem. another common reason for insomnia in kids is sleep association disorder. in this disorder children learn to fall asleep with a particular object or activity (such as rocking or patting). when they wake up periodically at night (as all of us do normally) they are unable to fall back asleep until they again have the same object or activity. sleep apnea can also occur in children and can cause insomnia. these are only a few of the reasons a child can have sleep maintenance insomnia. i would suggest talking first with your pediatrician. often it is a problem that they can easily address. if not they may recommend further consultation depending on what they think is going on."

    "Question": "why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?",
    "Answer": "heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output. heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water. in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid. this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath. because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. this edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. the heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. left-sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves. typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. in contrast right-sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema. persistent salt retention in these patients however may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. in patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. these patients therefore can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). the physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. these include: pitting edema of the legs and feet rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) and distended neck veins. the distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart."

    "Answer": "although diet doesn't directly cause gallbladder problems -- and it won't cure them -- watching what you eat and keeping a healthy weight might help you prevent gallstones from forming and avoid some discomfort if you do develop gallstones. if you're overweight try to lose the extra weight; but do it gradually. there is a link between quick weight loss and gallstone formation. crash or \"yo-yo\" diets can cause the liver to release more cholesterol into the bile disrupting the normal balance of cholesterol and bile salts. that extra cholesterol can form into crystals leading to gallstones. changing your diet won't get rid of gallstones that are already there but eating a healthy balanced variety of nutrients limiting the amount of saturated fats and cholesterol-heavy foods you eat and avoiding very low-calorie diets may help ease your symptoms."

    "Answer": "it's something i would call his pediatrician about. a physical exam can help rule out more serious causes of breast development in a boy and ease your mind. during puberty as in other stages of life it is not uncommon to see breast development in men. for example a newborn baby boy can have some degree of breast development which can be completely normal. its due to exposure to estrogen from the mother &/or the placenta during development. a health aging male can also have some degree of breast development and this would not necessarily signal a serious medical problem. these are settings in which the hormone estrogen stimulates breast development. about 40% of adolescent boys develop some degree of breast development. not to be confused with breast enlargement because of fatty tissue. you might see one or both breast develop or a boy might complain of breast tenderness. this usually resolves as the transition and hormonal changes of puberty are established. certainly take you son to see his doctor as there can be other more serious reasons for breast development in boys. and while a physical exam may help reveal the answer he may also need some type of breast imaging and blood test to help determine the cause."

    "Question": "i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?",
    "Answer": "i've had the same for 1 month and think i figured mine out! msg! i've never been allergic to anything (and have had many ramen noodles over the years). perhaps i've developed an allergy. i suspected ramen and when i didn't have a reaction the past couple days (and no ramen) i was thinking about trying them again to see what happened. i didn't try them again but tonight i had a reaction. stumped i checked the ingredients in the chips i had an hour before and sure enough. they contain msg."

    "Question": "the doctors did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positivebut the culture came back negitive. i went to the doctors on friday night and they did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positive. today i got a call saying the urinalysis came back negative and that i should follow up with my doctor and to continue to take the antibiotics they prescribed to me. what else could i have if the culture came back negative? what does that mean?",
    "Answer": "i can't answer that question since i don't know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results. i can tell you that about half of the women (i am also assuming you are a female) who have symptoms of a uti do not have them. many will have urethral irritation (usually from sexual activity) or even a vaginal infection. the culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better."

    "Answer": "ear drops instilled in the ear canal can go through patent (open) surgical tubes go down the eustachian tubes to the back of the throat. those drops would then have to travel upwards (unless she is lying down at the time) and go up to the nose and travel up the nasolacrimal duct to get to her high. this is really an unlikely journey. is it possible the drops are draining out of her ear canal into her eye or a finger goes into her wet ear and accidentally rubs her eyes a few moments later? hi there! thank you for answering my question. no when i instill them she is lying on her side and she feels them go to her eye from inside her ear. nothing is leaking or being touched externally. i wonder if it can be a nerve in her ear making her feel the sensation? is that possible? can a nerve make it feels like the liquid is traveling to her eye? thank you!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you and your mother are going through this. it's very difficult to watch a loved one deteriorate. although your mother doesn't trust doctors i think you should consider taking her to a good primary care provider for a complete assessment of her health and all her medications. if your mom doesn't trust \"doctors \" maybe try to find a nurse practitioner. this alone may set your mother's mind at ease. your mother certainly deserves to have her pain controlled to the extent possible and to have her other symptoms addressed. i can think of a number of conditions (none of them related to pain pill use) that could cause the symptoms of falling and disorientation including a urinary tract infection. that's why i think you should consider getting your mom to a medical professional. please don't give up just because you've made the rounds of health care providers for years. it can take a long time to find a provider who's a \"good fit\" and takes a true interest in the patient's health and well-being. also i'd suggest you make sure to take care of yourself. this sounds like a stressful situation and you don't want your own health to suffer. wishing you and your mom all the best!"

    "Question": "what are the causes of colon cancer?",
    "Answer": "doctors are certain that colorectal cancer is not contagious (a person cannot catch the disease from a cancer patient). some people are more likely to develop colorectal cancer than others. factors that increase a person's risk of colorectal cancer include high fat intake a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps the presence of polyps in the large intestine and chronic ulcerative colitis. diet and colon cancer diets high in fat are believed to predispose humans to colorectal cancer. in countries with high colorectal cancer rates the fat intake by the population is much higher than in countries with low cancer rates. it is believed that the breakdown products of fat metabolism lead to the formation of cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens). diets high in vegetables and high-fiber foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals may rid the bowel of these carcinogens and help reduce the risk of cancer. colon polyps and colon cancer doctors find that most colon cancers develop in colon polyps. therefore removing benign colon polyps can prevent colorectal cancer. colon polyps develop when chromosome damage occurs in cells of the inner lining of the colon. chromosomes contain genetic information inherited from each parent. normally healthy chromosomes control the growth of cells in an orderly manner. when chromosomes are damaged cell growth becomes uncontrolled resulting in masses of extra tissue (polyps). colon polyps are initially benign. over years benign colon polyps can acquire additional chromosome damage to become cancerous. ulcerative colitis and colon cancer chronic ulcerative colitis causes inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. colon cancer is a recognized complication of chronic ulcerative colitis. the risk for cancer begins to rise after eight to 10 years of colitis. the risk of developing colon cancer in a patient with ulcerative colitis also is related to the location and the extent of his or her disease. current estimates of the cumulative incidence of colon cancer associated with ulcerative colitis are 2. 5% at 10 years 7. 6% at 30 years and 10. 8% at 50 years. patients at higher risk of cancer are those with a family history of colon cancer a long duration of colitis extensive colon involvement and those with primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc). since the cancers associated with ulcerative colitis have a more favorable outcome when caught at an earlier stage yearly examinations of the colon often are recommended after eight years of known extensive disease. during these examinations samples of tissue (biopsies) can be taken to search for precancerous changes in the lining cells of the colon. when precancerous changes are found removal of the colon may be necessary to prevent colon cancer. genetics and colon cancer a person's genetic background is an important factor in colon cancer risk. among first-degree relatives of colon cancer patients the lifetime risk of developing colon cancer is 18% (a threefold increase over the general population in the united states). even though family history of colon cancer is an important risk factor majority (80%) of colon cancers occur sporadically in patients with no family history of colon cancer. approximately 20% of cancers are associated with a family history of colon cancer. and 5% of colon cancers are due to hereditary colon cancer syndromes. hereditary colon caner syndromes are disorders where affected family members have inherited cancer-causing genetic defects from one or both of the parents. chromosomes contain genetic information and chromosome damages cause genetic defects that lead to the formation of colon polyps and later colon cancer. in sporadic polyps and cancers (polyps and cancers that develop in the absence of family history) the chromosome damages are acquired (develop in a cell during adult life). the damaged chromosomes can only be found in the polyps and the cancers that develop from that cell. but in hereditary colon cancer syndromes the chromosome defects are inherited at birth and are present in every cell in the body. patients who have inherited the hereditary colon cancer syndrome genes are at risk of developing large number of colon polyps usually at young ages and are at very high risk of developing colon cancer early in life and also are at risk of developing cancers in other organs."

    "Answer": "chickenpox is a common illness that causes an itchy rash and red spots or blisters (pox) all over the body. it is most common in children but most people will get chickenpox at some point in their lives if they have not had the chickenpox vaccine. chickenpox usually isn't serious in healthy children. but it can cause problems for pregnant women newborns teens and adults and people who have immune system problems that make it hard for the body to fight infection. after you have had chickenpox you are not likely to get it again. but the virus stays in your body long after you get over the illness. if the virus becomes active again it can cause a painful viral infection called shingles. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "i can take an antihistamine or any medicine while using flonase amoxicillin and sudafed",
    "Answer": "whenever you have a question about medications remember you can always call a pharmacist. they truly are the drug experts and are always happy to answer your questions. plus you usually can reach one at any time of the day or night. assuming you're an otherwise healthy adult with no known drug allergies then you should be able to safely take an antihistamine (such as diphenhydramine) along with flonase sudafed and amoxicillin. flonase is a steroid nasal spray designed to help relieve allergy symptoms by shrinking inflamed tissue. sudafed is a decongestant which helps dry up excessive secretions. amoxicillin is an antibiotic. be sure to take all of your amoxicillin prescription. do not stop taking it just because you start feeling better. it's very important to take all of your antibiotic pills on the prescribed schedule. do not \"save\" any antibiotics for future use. this type of behavior contributes to the development of bacteria that resist treatment by antibiotics. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "how can i make sure my child eats a healthy lunch at school?",
    "Answer": "school lunch programs are designed to provide nutritious lunches right? in theory that’s true. in reality it just doesn’t happen. having my own two kids attend public schools i have seen the menus and eaten at the school cafeterias. i’m sorry but i would really like to see the nutrition facts for the salisbury steak or the beef enchilada plate sometime. color me skeptical. and it’s no surprise to me that kids who eat school lunches are more likely to be overweight. according to a 2010 study from the university of michigan school lunch buyers eat more fatty meat drink sugary beverages and eat fewer fruits and veggies than kids who pack their lunch. the problem: healthy food choices may be in the lunch line but that’s not what the kids are selecting. so our job as parents is to a) make sure kids make healthy food choices in the lunch line and/or b) pack a healthy lunch for them. better yet let your child help pack his lunch. and when you pack that lunch aim for fresh food instead of prepackaged stuff. pack up an apple or banana instead of fruit cocktail or mandarin oranges. offer raw carrots and lowfat ranch dressing instead of a side of chips with that sandwich. and give a water bottle or lowfat milk as a drink. trust me it can be done. yes it takes some planning and grocery shopping. and yes we are all very busy people. but it takes less than 10 minutes before bedtime to pack a nutritious lunch."

    "Answer": "hypokalemia is a medical term for low potassium levels in the blood. potassium is a mineral required by the body – especially the heart – to function properly. potassium levels are measured by a simple blood test. low potassium levels can be caused by many things including: • use of diuretics (a \"water pill\") • severe or prolonged diarrhea • use of certain antibiotics (such as penicillin) • excessive vomiting • an eating disorder such as bulimia • hyperthyroidism (very high levels of thyroid hormone caused by an overactive thyroid gland) a small drop in potassium levels usually isn't cause for concern and may not even cause you to experience any symptoms. a larger drop in potassium levels can cause the following symptoms: • constipation • fatigue • abnormal heart rhythm (often experienced as palpitations) • muscle spasms (such as cramps in your calf muscles) if you have low potassium levels your healthcare provider may prescribe a potassium supplement to fix the problem. if your hypokalemia is caused by hyperthyroidism your provider may treat the thyroid problem in order to get your potassium levels back to normal."

    "Question": "is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis?",
    "Answer": "that’s a controversy. i have many patients including physicians as adults who’ve been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they’re hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it’s almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off. some men will tell you that they don’t feel any more or less after the circumcision. some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that don’t like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it’s social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place. there are risks to the surgery. in good hands those risks are minimal but they can’t be eliminated. so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides. usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact. luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling. you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well. great product. hope this helps."

    "Answer": "guilt can cause some interesting side effects. i suspect you can achieve intercourse with your wife because you are comfortable with her and marital relationships are appropriate. you may be having problems having sex with someone other than you wife because you have deep-down feelings of guilt or remorse about this forbidden relationship. there is not likely anything wrong medically with your penis but since your penis is controlled by your brain perhaps this is where you should focus. we all possess our own sense of right and wrong so maybe your brain is trying to tell you something? maybe if you asked your wife for permission to have sex with your girlfriend things may be easier. or not. maybe its psychological due to overwhelming feelings of guilt caused be being a loser scumbag get rid of the girlfriend and enjoy life with the one you committed to. all i am going to say is that you should not be having sex with anybody outside of your wife. maybe that is divine intervention trying to let you know and could be the root of your problem. your girlfriend may know about your wife but does your wife know about your girlfriend. things to consider. just because your girlfriend knows about your wife doesn't make the guilt go away. if your wife doesn't know i think it has a lot to do with your subconscious guilt. my boyfriend was cheating on me and he couldn't get an erection for me. so i think it has to do with guilt regardless of the use of an enhancer."

    "Answer": "pros compared to the traditional dental drill lasers: may cause less pain in some instances therefore reducing the need for anesthesia may reduce anxiety in patients uncomfortable with the use of the dental drill minimize bleeding and swelling during soft tissue treatments may preserve more healthy tooth during cavity removal cons the disadvantages of lasers are that: lasers can't be used on teeth with fillings already in place. lasers can't be used in many commonly performed dental procedures. for example lasers can't be used to fill cavities located between teeth around old fillings and large cavities that need to be prepared for a crown. in addition lasers cannot be used to remove defective crowns or silver fillings or prepare teeth for bridges. traditional drills may still be needed to shape the filling adjust the bite and polish the filling even when a laser is used. lasers do not eliminate the need for anesthesia. laser treatment tends to be more expensive since the cost of the laser is much higher than a dental drill. lasers can cost between $39 000 and $45 000 compared to about $600 for a standard drill."

    "Answer": "pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so it’s important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? what’s a reasonable calorie restriction for you? what’s your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps. <link> i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are \"out of whack. \" birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle (though not all of the time). i would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologist(sp? )."

    "Question": "is it ever safe to have unprotected sex? i've heard women cannot get pregnant right before their period. is this true?",
    "Answer": "while there are certain times during a woman's monthly cycle where she may be less likely to get pregnant this is a very unreliable method for preventing pregnancy. first of all a woman would need to know when she's ovulating and most women cannot reliably tell. and even if she can tell there is still a chance she could get pregnant even if she avoids sex for several days following ovulation. i would not recommend this approach if you're trying to prevent pregnancy. it has a high rate of failure. also of course unprotected intercourse always runs the risk of transmitting stds such as herpes gonorrhea chlamydia and even hiv."

    "Answer": "your testosterone levels are probably fine but you can ask for a blood test to be sure. at age 22 testosterone levels tend to be raging so your medical provider may discount your request to the test. the fact that you have some fatty breast enlargement (man boobs) does not imply you have a hormonal issue. since breast tissue is primarily fatty tissue (in men) this is not a \"red flag\" but you will have to have your medical provider make that call. the amount of body hair especially facial hair a person has is usually genetically-determined. if you got a hairy parent like sasquatch then expect to be hairy. if your genetics or ethnicity is one where facial body hair is less common you may be more likely to follow that pathway. in my early 20's like you i had a tough time growing a decent mustache. i now have a full beard and hair growing out of my ears! maybe the same will happen to you. my friend had the same issue. once the doctor tested his testosterone adnd figured it was really low he was given cream to rub onto legs and then later on injections. but he then started growing a mustache and hair on chest which is somethin he didnt have before. low testosterone also makes one feel super low on energy for everyday life and also low sex drive and interest. hope this helps"

    "Answer": "have you had your blood sugar tested lately? you describe some of the classic symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. this condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin. this over-reaction by the body leaves too little glucose (sugar) available to your cells for processing. symptoms of hypoglycemia can include: nausea/vomiting sweating dizziness/lightheadedness fainting shakiness heart palpitations blurred or double vision i suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms. your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you don't have diabetes. meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve. it sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body -- not a lot though. too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again! wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "the single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine each season. about two weeks after vaccination antibodies develop that protect against influenza virus infection. flu vaccines will not protect against flu-like illnesses caused by non-influenza viruses. the best ways to avoid the flu are to get the flu vaccine. the flu can be very serious and cause hospitalization. the flu season is october to may generally so it is important to get the vaccination. also it is key to have good handwashing habits. most often the flu is spread through coughing and sneezing but sometimes the virus can live on a surface for a little while after a contagious person has touched it. if you haven't had your flu vaccine talk to your doctor about it today. a very important way to avoid the flu is to get the flu vaccine. other ways include good handwashing as the flu virus can live on a surface for a while. when you touch that surface and eat without washing your hands you could be exposed to the flu virus. so remember to wash your hands often! also make sure you get plently of sleep as a well rested body can help to prevent infections. washing your hands. possibly caring hand sanitizer for the outdoor trips. using disinfectants regularly throughout your house. pretty much just keeping the germs to a minimum. get the flu shot on a yearly basis. it should be before flu season takes off. get it in sept or oct. do not get the shot if you have a cold. wait until the cold is gone."

    "Question": "is there any financial help for fertility treatment out there? . i am 35 years old and i have been trying to get pregnant for over a year. my husband and i want to have a baby. i have noticed that i have thought about having baby more and more. it is making me feel more sad for not be able to have a baby. my husband make just enough money to pay the bills and i keep think that i will never be able to give him a baby. we don't have insurance or money to pay for fertility treatment. please help me and let me know if there is any organization that help.",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear about your situation. there are a few options you should be aware of. first you say you have no health insurance. starting october 1 2013 health insurance marketplaces will open up around the country as a result of the affordable care act. these are online health insurance shopping sites that will allow you to compare and purchase health plans. plans purchased this fall will go into effect january 1 2014. for the first time you can't be turned down by insurers and there will be financial assistance available to many people that will lower the cost of insurance which may make it possible for you and your husband to gain coverage. and depending on your income you may qualify for medicaid. you can plug in some numbers on webmd's health insurance reform cost calculator to see what kind of assistance you qualify for. all new health plans must include maternity and newborn care which you'll need if you do become pregnant. in some states fertility treatments may be included in insurance plans as well. to learn about financial assistance for fertility treatments i recommend you contact the american society for reproductive medicine."

    "Answer": "herpes is one of hardest viruses to diagnose. many people carry the virus in their body but may go months or even years without an outbreak. the best advice i can give to you is to always use protection when sexually active and whenever you think you might be having an outbreak to see your doctor just in order to be sure. hope this helps"

    "Answer": "probably what happened is what’s called a penile fracture. it really isn’t a break like the break of a bone. but there’s two chambers within the penis that hold the blood the corpora cavernosa. and it’s a very thin-walled structure that becomes very distended very tense and that’s where the rigidity of the erection occurs. in certain rare circumstances the torqueing the stretch on that is enough to pop and crack one of those chambers. classically the man will experience severe excruciating pain sudden disappearance of the erection horrible pain with blood the penis will become purple cracking sound and close but almost excruciating pain and that’s a surgical emergency. they have to stop what they’re doing and go immediately to the emergency room. it may require surgical intervention. the risk of that is because of the risk of the scar from the healing of the tear men can end up with curvature and even permanent impotence. the good news is it’s fairly rare almost always occurs in very aggressive wild sex usually women on top what happens is the penis comes out vaginal vault but goes back in and misses hits the pubic bone in the woman and that’s enough for the organ to pop."

    "Question": "i am a guy and i get ingrown hairs on my face from shaving. no matter what i do i can't get rid of the bumps. help!",
    "Answer": "this is a very common problem in men. usually along the lower part of the beard area and the neck there are two issues that could be going on. one is that you are using the wrong products in the wrong way and two is that there may be an underlying medical condition. so let's start with the straightforward simple to treat part. it's important to treat when your skin is the most hydrated that is when there is most water in the skin which would be towards the end of the shower or after showering and that's when your skin has the most water in it and it’s softest. it's also important to use a shaving cream or gel that will add some hydration to the skins that will go along with the razor very nicely. it's also critical to use a razor that's very sharp. if there is one dull point on a razor that one dull point will eventually hit every part of the skin and will create irritation. so use a razor that's new and sharp and if you keep getting the bumps try changing to a different type of razor that might help as well. after you shave you should use an aftershave and try to look for one that has some emollients in it like glycerin something that's alcohol free. a lot of aftershaves can be up to 85% alcohol which can be very irritating to the skin. if that persists if you still have the bumps after that in men who have very curly hair such as men with skin of color. or some very redheads can have very curly hair as well what happens is that when you get a very close shave as the hair grows back in the hair curls and the tip of the hair sticks back into the skin and that's called pseudofolliculitis barbae. so a folliculitis would be an inflammation of the follicle a pseudofolliculitis is because that hair is sticking back into the skin and creating something like an inflammation of the follicle but it's really a skin irritation and barbae means beard area. so for this what we do is either try not to get as close a shave if that's okay or you can use some prescription medications that will help soothe and soften the area to try to prevent that. if worst comes to worst you can try laser hair removal for the area and that's typically fine to do in the neck area where it won't really show but most men don't want their beard hair completely removed. but those are some tools that can help you."

    "Question": "does stress really cause rapid aging?",
    "Answer": "the answer is yes. studies now confirm what we all knew to be true –- prolonged stress does lead to premature and rapid aging of every cell in the body. stress is the ultimate mind-body connection. when we perceive stress our body responds rapidly with a multitude of changes. changes intended to prepare us for the fight or flight response. our heart rate goes up our blood pressure increases blood flow is increased to the brain heart and muscles. protective hormones adrenaline and other chemicals begin surging through the bloodstream nerves begin firing all senses are brought to peak awareness. all this so we are in a state of extreme readiness to take on any threat. this was good hundreds and thousands years ago. what about today? stress is inevitable. with so much stress from work and life that is not a threat to our survival what does all this stress do to our bodies? long term intense stress is not good for the body and accelerates aging. this is especially true if you don’t feel in control over the things that are causing stress. when the stresses do not resolve your immune system is weakened. stressed individuals become ill more frequently. excessive stress actually shortens the life span of the cells throughout the body so that every tissue and organ is ages rapidly. the body begins accumulating highly toxic levels of free radical particles that cause even more oxidative damage to cells and tissues. damage that promotes aging. and because the stress response is so quick to come on and so slow to fade it is likely that those in prolonged high stress occupations like [the united states] president begin to age rapidly –- an aging process we can see over time in their face graying of hair and behavior. the answer? do your best to avoid or reduce excessive and prolonged stress. if that is not possible eat a healthy diet high in anti-oxidant rich foods exercise regularly sleep and laugh. most importantly work to develop stress reduction behaviors and attitudes so that you can better deal with any stresses you experience."

    "Question": "i’m trying to lose weight. what kind of exercise should i start off with? how long do i do them until i up my regimen?",
    "Answer": "the guidelines for exercise from the american college of sports medicine is to build up to 20-60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity 3-5 times a week at 60-90% of max heart rate and 2-3 days of resistance training. resistance training should be one set of 8-10 exercises that condition the major muscle groups 2-3 days per week 8-12 repetitions of each exercise. 10-15 repetitions may be more appropriate for older and more frail persons (approximately 50-60 yr of age and above). multiple-set regimens may provide greater benefits if time allows. one thing to do is identify your goals. if you're interested in building up stamina then aerobic activity (cardio) will work. if you want strength then it's resistance exercise. i suggest doing both if you can. for cardio you could walk bike swim elliptical or any other activity that gets your heart thumping. you can start with just 10 minutes if you like. i like the 5-minutes out 5-minutes back plan. just like it sounds you walk out for 5 minutes turn around and walk back. that's it. 10 minutes of walking and off you go about your day. if you feel ambitious you can do 7. 5 or even 10 minutes out and back and add some abdominal crunches when you finish. for resistance exercise i suggest an investment in exercise tubing. tubing is inexpensive and versatile (you can do lots of exercises withthem even in a chair) and a great way to get started with resistance exercise. you can start with a set of three for about $20. they come in colors to denote the tension. if you order them make sure to order the strap that allows you to attach the tube to a door (this is important) and if you want to work your legs ask for leg straps. some excellent webmd resources for starting exercise arehere: <link> (this article has superb fitness resources at the end about getting started) <link> the government also does a great job with physical activity resources. you can start here: <link> <link>"

    "Answer": "a woman gets pregnant when viable sperm meets a ripe ovum (egg). typically this takes place outside the fallopian tubes. not on the outside of your vulva. since there are millions of sperm and usually only one egg the chances are slim. it would be wise to keep an un-condomed penis away from the front door in the future."

    "Answer": "organizational problems are commonly (but not always) seen in children or teens with adhd. unfortunately medication that is effective for the other adhd symptoms of inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity may not touch the disorganization. a change in meds can be tried but may not make a difference. adderall xr is approved for doses up to 30mg. your prescribing physician may be willing to try a higher dose if there are no significant side effects at the current 25 mg dose. i would work on organizational strategies with him."

    "Question": "can low t affect a man's ability to show affection (not sexually)? . showing a level of intimacy that does not lead to sex. for example touching cuddlying kissing a desire for giving and receiving affection.",
    "Answer": "i don't believe that testosterone has anything to do with affection and intimacy. those emotions are between a man's ears than his legs. more than half of the people in this world do not have testosterone or extremely low levels. women and children for example. and they show plenty of affection need cuddling kissing and share lots of affection. if a man were surgically castrated for whatever reason this should not adversely affect his ability to show any of these important (and vital) human emotions. this issue is less likely to be biological and more likely to be psychological but it can be complex. while that may be difficult for a man to accept he often will need to be reminded that his biggest and most important sex organ is his brain. if he needs help a counselor can really help (if you can get by the stubbornness and get him (or you) to go)."

    "Answer": "the most likely reason is that one of your previous sexual partners has not experienced the hpv infection (most women don't) and if you're not looking for them (regular physicals) there can be some that small that your doctor wouldn't see them with his/her eyes only. there is a tiny tiny chance that you had a wart on your hands or some other part of the body that you cut and then spread the virus to your genitals (the doc told me that he sees this pretty much only when women shave and spread the virus with the razor because both sites have miniscule nics). but this is so unlikely that i would say it has to be your partners."

    "Question": "as a plastic surgeon are there patients you would refuse?",
    "Answer": "body dysmorphic disorder is a very recognized condition where the patient’s mind doesn’t really reflect what their appearance is. they always thing that they are not as good looking not as young they are unhappy with their appearance and despite having often very nice and appropriate procedures they want more they want something different. well frankly in our training for example we were trained by psychiatrists in interviewing you know how to interview how to ask the question how to get to it. now sometimes it’s not very hard because you know they come to us and they are 38 years old and they’ve had 3 face lifts already. but sometimes you’ve got to do a little more work. but generally you kind of get at the issues because you look at them and you listen and you get a sense and it just doesn’t seem right. in other words the patient’s worries seem disproportional to how good they look to you. that’s how you sort it out and the sorting is important because that patient generally presents i think a much bigger challenge than one might want to take on because they often are not satisfied regardless of the high quality of the work delivered. that’s one condition that has to be sorted out. the other condition is someone who doesn’t necessarily have the wrong view of their appearance they just feel like they have to be up to the minute and every year they just have to have something done to keep up with the joneses almost. it’s like a badge of honor or courage oh yes i just had a face lift this year. but the problem with that is with each successive operation becomes more difficult more fraught with hazard and runs the risk of going over the edge of looking natural. we had a very high profile patient come in here who i’ve known for 25 years. although i’ve not operated on her she was operated on by one of my teachers and when i first met her and she came in and asked me about having the chemical peel the chemical wrinkle removal process. well i know that my teacher did that procedure on her many many years ago and again it’s a long lasting procedure. she certainly did not need it so i advised against it and respectfully declined to take on the case. well i saw her later and somehow she had something else done and i have to say it wasn’t very good. she looked wrong she looked pulled she looked strapped to the 747 look. and that you can’t disengage that i mean that it’s permanent you can’t reverse it. so sometimes peculiar to our community here particularly the hollywood environment there’s a little greater tendency towards that. people are struggling very hard to hold on to that youthful appearance. but as you know from some of the very high profile celebrities who have had too much nose job work done etcetera etcetera you can pass the point of no return and that’s not very good. bad decision bad decision by the patient and by the way bad decision by the doctor. i can tell you in our practice here 20% of the people that come in are told either that it’s not appropriate to do or what they have is so unusual complex or whatever that they would best be served at least by a consultation with another specialist. for example someone who has had two or three eyelid operations and they’ve had some problems with it i’m not sure they should have another one. but i will defer to my colleague in the ophthalmic plastic surgery world to help make that decision. there is always the risk of taking an imperfection and making it worse and that is never a happy scene. no surgeon wants to preside over either a complication or a failure. you want the right operation for the right patient and that gives you a happy patient and that’s what drives us in this work. it’s about making people happy and having a waiting room of people on the post-operative visit days who are all sitting there saying wow this is really great i’m glad i did this."

    "Answer": "you should check out new options available to you through your state's health insurance marketplace. you can find information about your state here: <link>. if you have no income you'll qualify for very steep subsidies to lower the cost of your insurance as well as the amount you pay when you go for doctor visits. regarding age limits i think you're referring to medicare -- not medicaid. medicare becomes available to you at age 65. medicaid is also being expanded in a little more than half the states around the country and without income you would qualify. however georgia is one of the states that chose not to expand its medicaid program unfortunately leaving many low income people like yourself without as many affordable health insurance coverage options."

    "Answer": "i can address your bppv concerns but unfortunately it is not possible to predict how long you might have symptoms (assuming you were correctly diagnosed). bppv has an annoying habit of coming back. bppv is an inner ear problem. it does not cause palpitations or \"head rush\" and is not related to neck disorders so these symptoms are not likely associated. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv) is the most common cause of vertigo. the patient usually has episodes of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or as brief as 15 seconds. specific movements of the head often provoke the attack usually following a brief delay of several seconds. people quickly realize the specific head motion or motions which tends to trigger an attack. there are effective treatments but you may need to see an ent. look up and do the eply maneuver! on one side or both. i got it suddenly and severely with projectile vomiting-it was awful! the doctors and hospial were basically useless and this one move absolutely fixed it. some people only need to do it once--i needed to do it about 5 times in a row ( 15 or 20 minutes in between) - and it works unfailingly! do it! you will cure the vertigo-it reattaches the ear chrystals! let me know and pass it around ok? be well! it will go away after a few seconds or minutes depending on the severity. there are those however which recur from time to time. i suggest doing half somersault maneuver which has been devised by dr. carol foster. you can just google \" half somersault maneuver \" or visit halfsommersaultmaneuver. com for a detailed process of the diy exercise."

    "Answer": "the ongoing meningitis outbreak is scary and people are very confused about its cause. the current fungal meningitis outbreak is related to contaminated vials of an injectable steroid preparation called methylprednisolone acetate which is used to treat spinal pain. that means the people currently affected by fungal meningitis are those who received injections from a tainted vial of steroid preparation. (note: the investigation into this situation is ongoing and more medications may have been implicated by the time you read this. ) in addition to date all of the contaminated product has been linked to a single compounding pharmacy called new england compounding center (necc). all products made by necc are currently under recall by the food and drug administration. methylprednisolone oral tablets also are a steroid compound. these tablets are used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions among other things. to date methylprednisolone tablets have not been linked to any cases of fungal meningitis. as long as your tablets didn't come from necc (which is probably the case; most methylprednisolone tablets are mass-produced in factories) you should be safe. if you have any concerns about this contact your pharmacist or the prescribing physician. i hope you find this information useful."

    "Answer": "when there is a dark line along the bridge (top) of the nose it is often due to allergies and rubbing the nose. the gold-standard skin brightener is hydroquinone. the typical prescription-strength products contain 4% hydroquinone. it can be irritating to your skin though so your dermatologist will review if this is the right treatment for you and how it should be used for your condition. over-the-counter products can contain up to 2% hydroquinone but i believe this ingredient should only be used under the supervision of your dermatologist."

    "Question": "is malaria a particular problem during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "yes. malaria may pose a serious threat to a pregnant woman and her fetus. malaria infection in pregnant women may be more severe than in women who are not pregnant. malaria may also increase the risk of problems with the pregnancy including prematurity abortion and stillbirth. statistics indicate that in sub-saharan africa between 75 000-200 000 infants die from malaria per year; worldwide estimates indicate about 2 million children die from malaria each year. therefore all pregnant women who are living in or traveling to a malaria risk area should consult a doctor and take prescription drugs (for example sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) to avoid contracting malaria. treatment of malaria in the pregnant female is similar to the usual treatment described above; however drugs such as primaquine (primaquine) tetracycline (achromycin sumycin) doxycycline and halofantrine (halfan) are not recommended as they may harm the fetus. in addition to monitoring the patient for anemia an ob/gyn specialist often is consulted for further management."

    "Answer": "although it is hard to say if you have the flu or not if you are still feeling ill please call you healthcare provider and ask their advice about treatment for your illness if you get the flu pumping your breast milk and having a healthy adult give your baby the breast milk is a good way to protect your baby. the flu virus is not transmitted through breast milk. maternal antibodies are transmitted through breast milk which may actually help protect the child if s/he was already exposed to influenza. it is ok to take antivirals to treat the flu while you are breastfeeding. if there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are sick try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring for your baby. you should also be very careful about washing your hands and taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. if you think your baby has developed flu-like symptoms please call your healthcare provider quickly so your baby may be examined."

    "Answer": "any time you're not using birth control it's possible to get pregnant. it's pretty much that simple. ok maybe not. granted there are some days when you are much more fertile than others because you're ovulating or on the verge of ovulating. assuming your period started on 10/8 the date of 10/17 would be right around your \" fertile window. \" so yes you could possibly be pregnant. keep in mind fertility calculators like the one i linked to above are not foolproof. the ovaries do not consult a calendar before popping out an egg so you could possibly ovulate before a calendar says you're fertile -- or after. if your period was due 11/2 you certainly could take an over-the-counter pregnancy test now to see if you're pregnant or not. i wish you the result you desire!"

    "Answer": "most multivitamins contain vitamin a because they provide all the vitamins recommended. you may not need to take a multivitamin if you eat right and consume fortified foods. in fact research hasn't shown that multivitamins protect against chronic disease and in some cases can lead to excesses of certain nutrients due to fortifcation and enrichment of food. most people fall short on vitamin d and calcium so you can take those separately. potassium is another shortfall nutrient but it isn't in multis and can be increased with eating more produce (fruits and vegetables). women capable of becoming pregnant should take daily folic acid. older individuals may need additional vitamin b12 due to decreased absorption. i recommend seeing a registered dietitian to discover which nutrients you are lacking and developing a plan for getting those nutrients from food and/or supplements. to find an rd go to eatright. org."

    "Answer": "sometimes hitting the outer skin is half the battle. i used to have really bad acne when i was younger and they prescribed me a lot of creams that never worked. i heavily researched online and noticed how a diet plays a significant role in oily skin that results in breakouts. i decided to do a research study of my own and it involved a two week diet of using olive oil grease and other fatty foods. then the next two weeks i ate more vegetables (especially a & c) and also took 50 mg of zinc and cut the saturated fats within 40g and consumed 0 trans fats. the first two weeks i experienced break outs that only seemed to keep getting worse and worse. then the after the first week of eating healthier i noticed a halt and no new acne had sprung up or anything and most of my breakouts began to go away. at the end of the second week my skin had just about cleared up which was expected due to the vitamin a c and zinc helping reduce oily skin. in reality dermatology is a scam when many home remedies can be found in your home. hope this helps"

    "Answer": "usually when we talk about a \"blood clot in the leg \" we're referring to a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) this is a blood clot deep in the leg (usually but not always in the calf muscle) that can cause complications such as a pulmonary embolism or stroke. part of the reason why a dvt is scary is because we can't see it. only after it begins causing problems do we notice its presence: a red swollen lower leg. what you're describing sounds more like a varicose vein. these veins lie close to the surface of the skin and are easily visible. varicose veins have a ropey appearance and can be painful and cause swelling of the leg or foot. interestingly on rare occasion a varicose vein can actually be a sign of a dvt. for this reason and because the vein is causing you discomfort it would be a good idea to have this checked out by your primary care provider. best wishes to you!"

    "Answer": "the short answer to your question is: don't ever mix pain relievers without asking your health care provider or pharmacist. a quick phone call to your pharmacy or health care provider's office may give you just the answer you need. in general i want to add if you're taking the narcotics (morphine and percocet) for post-surgical pain it's a good idea to take them only as needed. understand that many narcotic pain relievers such as oxycodone/apap (percocet) contain other medications. specifically percocet contains acetaminophen (tylenol) so you should never take extra acetaminophen with percocet. if you do so you may easily exceed the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen which can cause liver damage. i'd recommend you call your health care provider's office and ask to speak to a nurse about this. he or she can give you specific instructions about how to treat your pain. good luck!"

    "Question": "is it necessary to see a doctor if you think you broke a toe? . i got really drunk one night and the next morning i woke up to a severely swollen and bruised toe. i cannot bend it and it hurts off and on. is it necessary to have a doctor look at it or can i let it heal on it's own?",
    "Answer": "it's always kind of questionable whether or not to treat a suspected broken toe isn't it? if the toe is crooked or grossly deformed then i'd suggest you really ought to see a doctor at least to set it properly. if it's a severe break a doctor can give you some options for fixing it ranging from splinting to surgery. he or she also can tell you what long-term consequences you may face from fixing the break versus not fixing it. it also depends a little bit on which toe you're talking about. if you think you broke your big toe it's probably worth a trip to the doctor because the big toe is the most important one when it comes to walking. if you're talking about your pinky toe and it's not grossly deformed you might be able to get away with simply taping it to the adjacent toe in order to splint it. meanwhile keep the foot elevated to reduce swelling. as long as you're not allergic to over-the-counter pain relievers you can take them for the pain. good luck to you!"

    "Answer": "to use a condom correctly follow these main tips: a male should wear a condom throughout the entire time of sexual contact. a male should wear a condom each and every time there is sexual contact. the condom should not be removed before ejaculation and the condom should be held at the top of the penis closest to the body so it doesn’t slip off before the penis is pulled away from the vagina. do not use petroleum jelly (vaseline) cold cream or baby oil with a latex condom because they break down the latex which may allow sperm and stds to get through. around 15% of unplanned pregnancies are a result of not using a condom correctly. condoms are sold in drug stores."

    "Question": "does amoxicillin alter your menstral cycle and does it interfere with my birth control pills. i went to urgent care and diagnosed was with an ear infection and really bad congestion. they prescribed amoxicillin to me but i didn't think to ask if it would interfere with my birth control. but my concern is that the day i started my antibiotic was the day my period was suppose to start. i typically don't start right on sunday more like monday night. but its now friday and i haven't started. i am suppose to start my new pill pack this coming sunday. should i be worried or is their an answer",
    "Answer": "this is an excellent question because there is a lot of outdated information circulating about the effect of antibiotics on the effectiveness of birth control pills. let me start with your first question. i'm not aware of any studies that show amoxicillin affects the menstrual cycle in any way. however you will find a lot women claiming on internet forums that their period was delayed when they took amoxicillin. this doesn't mean it's true. many things (including illness) can affect your cycle. if you take amoxicillin and experience a delayed period in the future then you will have a good idea of whether or not this medication affects you in this way. to your second question: women for decades have been advised to use secondary (back-up) birth control if they take antibiotics while on birth control pills. this is prudent advice. however today it's thought only two specific antibiotics (rifampin and rifabutin) may actually decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills. so the amoxicillin should not affect your hormonal birth control but if you want extra peace-of-mind then use a condom until after you've finished the antibiotics. if you believe you may be pregnant you should take an at-home pregnancy test. if the test is negative then you should be ok to start your next pack of birth control pills on schedule whether or not your period arrived. if the pregnancy test is positive then obviously you should not take birth control pills but you should see a doctor to begin prenatal care wishing you well!"

    "Question": "why does grey hair itch so much? . why does my grey hair itch so much? . recently my hair have started to turn grey. and i have notice it really itches a lot. i and i don't have dry scalp or dandruff. i wash and condition my hair once weekly and moisture the scalp at least twice weekly( have short hair about 3 in)but it still itches. i've talked to other women who said the same thing is happening to them.",
    "Answer": "hair doesn't itch. scalps will itch. there are so many different causes of itching that it would not be possible to blindly sort them out over the internet. if your newly-grey scalp is itching it would be wise to see a dermatologist so that you can be properly examined and treated. just because another grey hair friend has an itchy scalp too does not imply that you both have the same thing. the color of your hair is really irrelevant. i'm not a licenses professional in anyway. however i have had grey hair for several years. every time the grey hair would grow it would itch like something is invading my head. in my early onset there where several occasions that i was checked and treated for lice as well with no indications there was lice present to begin with. i would just take the necessary precautions to eliminate any unwanted parasites and add protection to my scalp. the first time i noticed i had grey i felt shocked because of how young i was and how itchy my head became so i always dyed it with box dye to cover it. however over time more grey hair was developing and as it grew out i could feel this itchiness come back. it would drive me so mad there was a point i was buying a box of hair dye every week. that eventually caused a lot of breakage in my hair. i can honestly say the grey hair could be causing your scalp to itch because of my experience that every time new grays emerged throughout my entire head i would be uncontrollably non stop itching."

    "Answer": "personally since you are only in the pre hypertension stage i would say start with the cardiologist recommendation. you can always go on the pills if it doesn't work. also do you check your blood pressure at any other time besides at the doctor? many people's bp's go up naturally just beacuse they are at the doctor. it's called white coat syndrome. go to your local pharmacy that has a blood pressure machine and check it there. (make sure you sit there at least 4 minutes before taking your pressure walking can raise it so you need to rest first)"

    "Answer": "perhaps i can put your mind at ease. what you're describing as \"pus\" probably isn't pus at all. if it were your doctor would have given you different instructions. is this \"pus\" a thick gooey yellowish fluid? if so that is not pus. it is actually a collection of excess protein molecules and wound-healing components being created by the body to help your wound close up. many patients see this yellowish goo and become alarmed thinking it is pus. but rest assured it is not. pus is usually greenish in color and has a very foul odor. pus represents an infection and usually brings on a fever. peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum which is a membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. rarely does surgery cause peritonitis. it usually is caused by an infection of the fallopian tube. if you are otherwise feeling fine without a fever eating well and walking you can be pretty sure you do not have a post-operative infection. just attend to the wound as the doctor told you. if by some chance you spike a fever be sure to call your surgeon's office. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i think it would be fine for you to see a professional at least for you personal assurance. an endocrinologist would be your best choice. the atypical distribution of body fat the lack of facial hair etc. could be related to a hormonal imbalance or it could be genetic but that is going to take some diagnostic testing."

    "Question": "why do my knees squeak while walking",
    "Answer": "well that's hard to say. the answer could depend on many factors including your age and whether or not you've had any knee injuries. in general it's not unusual for our knees to squeak pop creak and crackle when we walk or squat down. these sounds can be caused by a variety of things including simple wear-and-tear to the cartilage within the knee joint or osteoarthritis. as long as the squeaking isn't accompanied by pain the sound probably doesn't mean anything. if you start to have pain associated with your noisy knees then it would be a good idea to get it checked out. you can help keep your knees healthy by following these prevention tips. as always if you're concerned about whether or not there's something wrong with your knees don't hesitate to make an appointment with your primary care provider. good luck!"

    "Question": "is alternative medicine used to treat high blood pressure?",
    "Answer": "alternative medicine also called integrative or complementary medicine features the use of non-traditional (in the western world) techniques for treatment. for example self-relaxation approaches to the therapy of hypertension include yoga biofeedback and meditation. these techniques can be effective in lowering the blood pressure at least temporarily. in order to produce sustained reductions in the blood pressure these techniques may require hours of diligent adherence daily. they are generally practical only for a few highly motivated individuals with hypertension. acupuncture has not yet been established as a standard or proven therapy for hypertension in the western world. certain herbal remedies have blood pressure-lowering components that may well be effective in treating hypertension. most herbal remedies are available as food supplements and the food and drug administration (fda) does not approve them as drugs. therefore herbal treatments for hypertension have not yet been adequately evaluated in scientifically controlled clinical trials for effectiveness and safety. in particular their long-term side effects are unknown. a major problem with most herbal treatments is that their contents are not standardized. the ways in which herbal treatments work to lower blood pressure are not known and currently herbal remedies are usually not recommended for the treatment of hypertension."

    "Question": "what are warts and what causes them?",
    "Answer": "a wart is a harmless skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (hpv). there are more than 100 known types of hpv. hpv infects the top layer of skin usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. the virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly forming a wart. most warts go away on their own within months or years. warts can grow anywhere on the body. they are most common among children and young adults. there are five kinds of warts. they look different and form on different parts of the body. common warts grow most often on the hands but they may be anywhere on the body. they are rough shaped like a dome and gray-brown in color. plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet. they look like hard thick patches of skin with dark specks. plantar warts may cause pain when you walk and you may feel like you are stepping on a pebble. flat warts usually grow on the face arms or legs. they are small (usually smaller than the eraser on the end of a pencil) have flat tops and can be pink light brown or light yellow. filiform warts usually grow around the mouth nose or beard area. they are the same color as your skin and have growths that look like threads sticking out of them. periungual warts grow under and around the toenails and fingernails. they look like rough bumps with an uneven surface and border. they can affect nail growth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is the minimum number of calories a woman can safely eat long term (up to two years or more)? . i’ve seen numbers ranging from 800 to 1200 (even here on webmd) where 800 might be the break between low calorie and very low calorie and 1050 is where your body enters starvation mode. . 1200 is the conventional number but is this in keeping with modern understanding? if a person opted for 800 without supervision would this be safe and sustainable long-term provided it was followed with proper transition and maintenance?",
    "Answer": "the actual minimal number of calories that you can safely eat long term depends on your basal metabolic rate (bmr) which is the energy necessary for your body and its organs to maintain normal function while simply at rest. although there are equations to calculate bmr such as the harris-benedict equation these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary. there are other more accurate methods to calculate your bmr through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and co2 production. you could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if you’re genuinely curious otherwise the bmr equations might give you a good enough estimate. you’re correct in stating that 1 200 calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and i think that it’s fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population (again your actual number will vary). by far however 800 calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet (vlcd) because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories. this type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who don’t have proper medical supervision. your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a vlcd and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet. it’s important to note that although vlcds have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity-related conditions like hypertension diabetes or high cholesterol in obese individuals; they don’t seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term. you will likely regain any weight loss after going off the vlcd unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential."

    "Question": "what is a superior labral tear? . an mri showed a tear in my superior labral. located in my shoulder. along with that tendonitis was diagnosed. what can i do? ice really doesn't help. the pain threshold can be very bad when my arm is lifted a certain way but otherwise it feels perfectly normal. will the tear become worse? will it \"mend\" on its own? i have had two bad bouts with it. maybe overuse? thank you boni",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it is indeed very painful. in plain english a superior labral tear is a torn tendon at the top of your shoulder joint where the head of your arm bone meets the \"socket\" of your shoulder. it is not an uncommon problem. eventually the tendon probably will heal on its own. tendons and ligaments tend to heal very slowly because they have poor blood supplies. the bad news is it literally can take months for these tears to heal. in the meantime you want to make sure you don't lose range of motion in your shoulder. you should consult your doctor for specific advice on whether or not you should be doing range-of-motion exercises or not. if possible avoid moving your shoulder in a way that causes pain. basically that movement is aggravating the tear which will make it heal more slowly. ice won't help because the soothing comfort of cold can't reach deeply enough into the shoulder joint. if you're not allergic to ibuprofen you can take that for pain. again sorry you're going through this. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "which preventive care screenings and tests will be free after september 23? will they need a doctor's referral?",
    "Answer": "well you don’t need a doctor’s referral. hopefully you’ll go to the doctor to get the screening but you don’t need any special visit in advance of the screenings. and the preventive care option will cover a wide variety of things. so for parents children’s immunizations and vaccines will be covered a whole variety of cancer screenings will be covered mammograms and colon cancer. the u. s. preventive care task force which is a group of medical providers who are in the public health service actually look at preventive services that are the most effective and update their recommendations on a regular basis and they grade them a through d of what is effective for which age category and what kind of condition. and any screening that gets an a or a b will be automatically included in the kind of preventive care that’s offered without co-pays and without co-insurance. it’s very good news for people. … if you’re a 58-year-old woman with a chronic condition you would be recommended to get a pap smear yearly even if you’re healthy a mammogram yearly; you may have a screening or two for diabetes or for other conditions. you will be looking at potentially $300-$400 out of pocket and that for a lot of people is a pretty high financial burden particularly now in this downturn. …we’re updating medicare benefits so medicare beneficiaries will be able to have preventive care and have an annual wellness test. we’re getting to illness at the outset making sure that we can stop people from getting sick as opposed to paying for the care once they get sick makes good sense. and i think this is a great benefit that will be coming effective again on or after september 23. and it’s really good news for lots of folks."

    "Question": "can gas cause chest pain?",
    "Answer": "yes. chest pain has many possible causes; some are harmless but some (like a heart attack) can be life-threatening. part of the problem is that the heart and other internal organs have a type of sensory nerve conduction where it is sometimes difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact origin of a painful sensation. pain due to something wrong in the heart lungs or belly can be vague or feel like something else. this is why chest pain can be such a difficult problem for those who have it as well as for their doctors. gas causes swelling in the intestines and a bloated feeling. when gas causes pain it’s usually in the abdomen (belly). however the pain may also be felt in the chest. if pain is due to gas it should go away within a short time. other causes of chest pain not due to the heart include problems with the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) musculoskeletal (chest wall) pain problems in the lungs and many others. studies have shown that even doctors have a hard time identifying the cause of chest pain just through conversation or physical examination. laboratory tests a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram are generally needed to know for sure that chest pain is nothing serious. no one wants to call 911 or sit in an emergency room to be treated for what turns out to be gas pain. however playing a waiting game when you are having chest pain can be a gamble with your health or maybe your life. if you’re having chest pain in almost all cases a doctor’s recommendation will be to seek medical attention. yes thanks i have been having a chest pain and thru my underarm since early this morning i am scared it could be a heart attack then again i have experienced this pain before but does not last as long as it has today. it gets worse when i lay down. could it be gas or should i go to the emergency room yes yes"

    "Question": "why wont doctors do what i ask. doctors always give me the run around on treatment that i know i need. felling lumps in breast tingling when cold sensitive to touch etc. mamograms. have been done and other tests but i have to fight to get them every six months. he says well the lumps has not grown or other excuse but why not do a biopsy before its too late? are doctors obligated to do what i ask is necessary?",
    "Answer": "no doctors are not \"obligated\" do do what you want. like a biopsy that they feel may be unnecessary. your only course of action is to see a different surgeon plead your case and get a second opinion. surgeons do not want to just randomly remove or biopsy masses that may be cystic fibrocystic or clearly not suspicious of cancer. you have a cancer fear since these are your breasts. the only ones that you feel. the surgeon may have years of experience examining thousands of lumpy breasts and reading many mammograms and does not share in your fear or concern. you cannot force a surgeon into the operating room no matter how much you demand."

    "Answer": "tablet splitting or pill cutting is a practice that involves patients obtaining higher-strength tablets and breaking the tablet in half quarter or whatever smaller portion they can in an effort to save money. the fda has issued a statement on this practice. splitting tablets are risky for several reasons. 1. ) you might get confused about the right dose especially if you forget to split the tablet; 2. ) splitting a tablet does not guarantee an equal distribution of medication; 3. ) some tablets are hard to split and may even crumble when attempting to split; 4. ) not all pills are safe to split especially capsules and those with specially formulations to control drug release. i suggest not splitting any medication unless you and your health care provider have discussed the risks and benefits."

    "Question": "i was walking my dog and may have gotten poison ivy. how do i get rid of the itching? do i have to bathe my dog?",
    "Answer": "if you think your dog has poison ivy you should definitely wash your dog because if you are getting it from your dog then that's going to keep happening until you get that resin off the dog. the one thing is you can't spread it from yourself. so if you have poison ivy on your body and you scratch that's not how you spread it. it might be from under your nails or from your gardening toolkit or from your dog those can be sources of it but it's not from the rash itself. the way to treat it is really to see your dermatologist and get a strong cortisone cream or ointment or gel to put on it to help dry it up. when it's bad enough you may even have to take cortisone by mouth which isn't the ideal thing but sometimes when it's bad enough and it's uncomfortable that helps knock it out pretty well. it can start even two to three days after your exposure. so i have had patients come in and it's three or four days later and all of a sudden the rash starts to come out. so it doesn't always happen right away. the one thing is if you think your dog has poison ivy resin on its fur you have about ten minutes from your exposure to go wash it off. so if you have any suspicion; if he is out in the woods and he starts running around and he comes back and touches you and you know he was in an area where there was poison ivy try to get inside as quickly as possible. you can use soap to get that off your skin but after ten minutes it's in and you are going to have to deal with it. taking antihistamines also helps. so you can take that as well. something like benadryl or claritin or allegra all those types of antihistamines can help a lot. but sometimes when it's bad enough you just have to take prednisone by mouth for up to two weeks even before it starts to calm down."

    "Answer": "it is not good to sit on your anxiety and do nothing. yes it does cause emotional and physical pain. definitely. i've been through it still battle it and know what you mean. you must become proactive. get started immediately to help yourself. few people will understand how you feel. unfortunately. you will have to do a lot but not everything alone. maybe this (below) will help you in some way? i hope so. if money is a barrier and you are suffering which you seem to be consult with your doctor or a free clinic doctor about using a regimen of ipipromol - which is not a real expensive prescription. also it is not habit forming (get opinions from your doc to verify but often us docs do not know this item but they could look it up) like xanax or lorazepam and can lessen your anxiety level in a day or two (1) to help you sleep (for renewed energy) and (2) feel more normal and balanced to be able to map out a plan to deal more fully with your underlying problems. if you cannot afford a doctor you must find a free mental health clinic somewhere nearby that you can get to without too many hassles for some help with diagnoses. they are out there. even if you have to take a bus -whatever- make the effort! there is a reasonable chance that with anxiety there also is depression. both things should and must be treated to resume a truly \"normal life. \" it'll take time but don't hesitate to be active right now get started get on the phone see where you might get opipromol (it works quickly and is not too strong) and find that free mental health clinic. you can do it. get help from anyone willing and trustworthy. best of luck to you my friend. there is help out there somewhere. look for it right now."

    "Answer": "we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail; now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well. could there be long-term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving? let's review them briefly and put your mind at ease. 1. combined hormonal methods (e. g. birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring). these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility. we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle (whatever that means for you) within 3 months of stopping all of these methods. 2. progesterone only methods (the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant). we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months. the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due (since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot). again no long term impact on fertility 3. intrauterine device (iud). the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility (which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available). although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4. diaphragms condoms and spermicides. these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them. condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well. so where are the concerns regarding fertility? some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility. for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth. . the methods of birth control generally donot affects the fertility."

    "Answer": "some people with hepatitis c do not notice a big difference in the way they feel. others feel tired sick or depressed. the following are steps you can take at home that may help you feel better both physically and emotionally. slow down it is very common to feel tired if you have hepatitis c. ifyou feel tired give yourself permission to do less and rest more. if possible ask others to help out around your home or ask your employer for a shorter or more flexible work schedule. exercise exercise if you feel up to it. aerobic exercise can help you have more energy and may also improve depression. it is best to avoid any strenuous activities on the day after you receive peginterferon. eat regular nutritious meals sometimes people with hepatitis c have a hard time eating. you may have no appetite feel nauseated or have different tastes than you are used to. even if you do not feel like eating it is very important to eat small meals throughout the day. some people experience nausea in the afternoon. if this happens to you try to eat a big nutritious meal in the morning. if you have cirrhosis it may not be a good idea to eat salty foods or foods that are high in protein. if you want to know more about which foods to avoid and which foods are good to eat ask your doctor about meeting with a registered dietitian to discuss a healthy eating plan. avoid alcohol and drugs one of the most important jobs of your liver is to break down drugs and alcohol. if you have hepatitis c one of the best things you can do is to avoid substances that may harm your liver such as alcohol and illegal drugs. if you have cirrhosis you also may need to avoid certain medicines. if you use illegal drugs or alcohol it is important to stop. being honest with your doctor about your drug and alcohol use will help you deal with any substance abuse problems. if you do not feel that you can talk openly with your doctor you may want to find a doctor you feel more comfortable with. if you want to stop using drugs or alcohol and need help to do so ask your doctor or someone else you trust about drug and alcohol treatment options. because many medicines can stress your liver talk to your doctor before you take any prescription or over-the-counter medicines. this includes herbal remedies as well. control itching if you have itchy skin ask your doctor about taking nonprescription medicines such as diphenhydramine (for example benadryl) orchlorpheniramine (for example chlor-trimeton) to relieve itching. if you do take these medicines be sure to follow the instructions and to stop using the medicine if you have any side effects. seek help for depression depression may develop in anyone who has a long-term illness. it also can be a side effect of antiviral medicines for hepatitis c. if you are feeling depressed talk to your doctor about antidepressant medicines and/or counseling. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "baby : your baby measures about 9. 6 inches from crown to rump and weighs a little more than 2 pounds. hands are active and muscle coordination is such that he can get his thumb into his mouth. thumb-sucking calms the baby and strengthens his cheek and jaw muscles. your baby can cry now. mom-to-be : you may see stretch marks as your uterus continues to expand. most women have gained about 16 to 22 pounds by now. balance and mobility also may be changing as you grow larger. tip of the week : during your last trimester you should talk to your doctor or midwife about the delivery. you'll learn such things as signs to predict labor and how far apart the contractions should be before going to the hospital or birth center. it's also the time to begin interviewing pediatricians and to take care of other logistics like pre-registration and a birthing plan (what you envision your labor and delivery will be like). this plan should be written in your patient record or attached to it in the form of a birth plan."

    "Answer": "p { margin-bottom: 0. 08in; }a:link { } p { margin-bottom: 0. 08in; }a:link { } semen is not be a problem if he is disease free. however that being said swallowing semen is probably not as widespread as some would like you to think. i know that my wife doesn't like it and i don't force her to do it - that's nothing for her to be ashamed of. during oral sex she swallows all the pre-ejaculate (clear fluid) with no problem. occasionally when i kegel a heavy burst of pre-ejaculate will flow out and sometimes she will have to back off a little to swallow it. but the few times she has attempted to swallow semen has resulted in gagging – there's just too much thick fluid being introduced into the back of the throat to handle at one time when the penis is inserted 2-3 inches or more - unless you're really prepared for it. i know when i'm about to come and - unless your husband has premature ejaculation issues he does too. in 40 years of receiving oral sex i have only slipped up and started to ejaculate in her mouth probably less than 5 times. i tell her when i'm ready to go she pulls off and finishes me up with her hand. practice makes perfect. if you have a problem with the pre-ejaculate simply use a snug-fitting steel cock ring at the base of the penis to block the flow until such time as you think you're ready for it. i start with a cock ring occasionally for the extra engorgement sensation but i don't use it for the entire process because i am rather slow to come (40+ minutes) and the lack of blood flow through the penis for that period of time would be an issue for me. if your husband comes fast he could probably wear it all the way through to orgasm and it will prevent semen from exiting the penis. ejaculation while wearing the ring could possibly cause some pain for him though - i ejaculated while wearing one a couple times and it caused some pain in my testicles. he could try it in order to know for sure. the pain in not unbearable and it will go away. additionally remember that there is nothing dirty about oral sex between a man and his wife. there are various techniques and tricks that my wife performs on me that make the experience absolutely incredible. the term \"variety is the spice of life\" can be applied to oral sex as well. biting and sucking the penis open-mouth breathing with penis inserted licking the frenulum while sucking going deep then pulling off slowly allowing the penis to slip through your teeth gripping the penis with your hand while sucking rubbing his nipples while sucking and holding ice cubes or a throat lozenge in your mouth while performing all make for a great experience for him. even pulling off and allowing him to get a breather causes wild sensations when you start back up a few seconds later. remember simply sucking the penis will not always get the job done. see what he likes. again practice makes perfect."

    "Answer": "this is a very good question. to my knowledge there is no serious adverse reaction associated with taking famotidine with an antibiotic. however taking famotidine with an anti-fungal oral medication (such as the ones with names ending in \"azole\") can have serious side effects. taking certain antacid or anti-gerd medications like famotidine can reduce the effectiveness of other medications when taken together. thus it's a good idea to wait 1-2 hours before or after taking other medications before you take a product like famotidine. because you have finished your antibiotics (good for you! ) the real question is: do you still have symptoms of your illness? if not then you did no harm by combining the two medications. if you still feel ill then i'd suggest you go back to your primary care provider explain the situation and get evaluated to see if you need another course of antibiotics. in all likelihood everything worked out fine. at least that's my hope for you!"

    "Question": "is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise?",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology. ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise. icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation. ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area. never place ice directly on your skin however. wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time. you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval. heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation. heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area. heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise. heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10-15 minute intervals. always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve. within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first. i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice. somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1) lack of warm-up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel the work. and 2) lack of cooldown which will help the muscles recover by completing any partial combustion of sugars for energy leaving residual metabolites such as one feels with the muscle burn of working beyond anerobic threshold. anerobic threshold can be increased through more careful training. i can exercise well beyond my predicted 100% of age heart rate for periods of 10 20 and 30 minutes or more"

    "Answer": "although cancer-related fatigue is a common and often expected side effect of cancer and its treatments you should feel free to mention your concerns to your doctors. there are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. other times there may be treatments to help control some of the causes of fatigue. finally there may be suggestions that are more specific to your situation that would help in combating your fatigue. be sure to let your doctor or nurse know if you have: increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion uncontrolled pain inability to control side effects from treatments (such as nausea vomiting diarrhea or loss of appetite) uncontrollable anxiety or nervousness ongoing depression"

    "Question": "how can gallstones be prevented?",
    "Answer": "there is no sure way to prevent gallstones. but you can reduce your risk of forming gallstones that can cause symptoms. maintain a healthy weight stay close to a healthy weight. if you need to lose weight do so slowly and sensibly. when you lose weight by dieting and then you gain weight back again you increase your risk for gallstones especially if you are a woman. if you diet aim for a weight loss of only to a week. for more information see the topic weight management. be sure to avoid rapid weight loss and starvation diets. if you are on a rapid weight-loss diet it is recommended that you be under a doctor's care. you may want to ask your doctor about taking medicines to help reduce your chances of developing gallstones while you are on such a diet. eat regular balanced meals try not to skip meals. eat on a regular schedule. and eat meals that contain some fat (which causes the gallbladder to empty). this can help prevent gallstones. eat plenty of whole grains and fiber. and be sure to often have servings of foods that contain calcium (milk products and green leafy vegetables). limit saturated (animal) fat and foods high in cholesterol. exercise regularly if you exercise more you may be able to reduce your risk for gallstones. along with eating a low-fat diet exercise is also an effective way to help you stay close to a healthy weight and lower your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. deciding whether to take estrogen some evidence shows that taking hormones such as estrogen after menopause or taking high-dose birth control pills may increase a woman's risk of gallstones that cause symptoms. if you are taking such hormones talk with your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "besides not smoking exercising and eating a calcium-rich diet what else can i do to lower my risk of osteoporosis?",
    "Answer": "it sounds as though you are taking very good steps to prevent osteoporosis. exercise has a wide variety of beneficial health effects. however exercise does not bring about substantial increases in bone density. the benefit of exercise for osteoporosis has mostly to do with decreasing the risk of falls probably because balance is improved and/or muscle strength is increased. research has not yet determined what type of exercise is best for osteoporosis or for how long. until research has answered these questions most doctors recommend weight-bearing exercise such as walking preferably daily. you are also right in not smoking. smoking cigarettes decreases estrogen levels and can lead to bone loss in women before menopause. smoking cigarettes can also lead to earlier menopause. in regard to calcium it is recommended that premenopausal women take 1 000 mg of calcium in their diet each day. unfortunately surveys have shown that average women in the united states are consuming less than 500 mg of calcium per day in their diet less than the recommended amounts. additional calcium can be obtained by drinking more milk and consuming more yogurt cottage cheese and calcium-fortified foods such as orange juice or by taking calcium supplement tablets. before taking calcium supplements check with your doctor. calcium supplements are generally avoided if one has had kidney stones. an adequate calcium intake and adequate body stores of vitamin d are important foundations for maintaining bone density and strength. vitamin d helps the absorption of calcium from the intestines. vitamin d comes from the diet and the skin. vitamin d production by the skin is dependent on exposure to sunlight. active people living in sunny regions (southern california hawaii countries around the equator etc. ) can produce most of the vitamin d they need from their skin. conversely lack of exposure to sunlight due to residence in northern latitudes or physical incapacitation causes vitamin d deficiency. in less temperate regions such as minnesota michigan and new york skin production of vitamin d is markedly diminished in the winter months especially among the elderly. in that population dietary vitamin d becomes important. when a women becomes menopausal estrogen supplementation is considered. menopausal hormone therapy (previously referred to as hormone replacement therapy or hrt) has been shown to prevent bone loss increase bone density and prevent bone fractures. it is useful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women."

    "Answer": "well yes and no. incentive spirometers generally are used by patients after surgery or by people who suffer from an injury (such a fractured rib) that causes them not to breathe well or deeply. as you slowly breathe in through the spirometer it causes inflation of the small sacs in the lungs called alveoli. inflating the alveoli helps keep them free of fluid build-up. fluid build-up in the alveoli can lead to pneumonia. in a healthy individual using an incentive spirometer could theoretically increase air flow which would aid in lung function. studies have not shown that using an incentive spirometer increases or improves lung function in individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (copd) or other chronic lung problems. i hope this is helpful!"

    "Question": "just got results of blood work showed high potassium level what could be cause and dangers?",
    "Answer": "only your health care provider can really help you with this. let me explain a little bit about lab results and why they can be hard to interpret. \"lab work\" generally refers to blood analysis. you go in someone takes a vial or two of blood and then these samples are analyzed for various components. depending on the testing your health care provider ordered the blood may be analyzed for cell counts (white red etc. ) vitamins like potassium and/or hormones like thyroid. scientists have established \"reference ranges\" to determine the normal values of each of these blood components. they set these ranges by analyzing the blood of healthy people and then averaging the results. so for example the normal reference range for potassium in an adult is 3. 5 to 5. 1. (we won't get into the unit of measure because it's too complicated to explain here. ) let's say your potassium level was 5. 2. that would get flagged on the lab paperwork as a \"high\" potassium level. but it's doubtful your doctor would treat this. by the same token maybe your potassium tested at 3. 2. again that would get flagged as a \"low potassium\" result but your health care provider may or may not treat it. this is why i began by saying only your health care provider can determine whether or not your \"high\" potassium level is something to be concerned about. if it is then he or she will take the appropriate steps to treat the problem. if you have any questions about your lab work please do make an appointment to see your provider and discuss the results. hope you found this helpful!"

    "Answer": "you may have breast cysts or your normal breast tissue is reacting to hormonal changes during your cycle. either way it is important that you have your breasts properly examined. you can see your primary care medical provider or ask to see a gynecologist. you are correct that 15 year olds would not likely have breast cancer so the most logical explanation would be benign cysts or fibrocystic breast lumps but this cannot be conclusively determined blindly over the internet."

    "Question": "what causes influenza?",
    "Answer": "the flu is caused by the influenza virus. doctors classify the virus as influenza type a and type b each of which includes several subtypes or strains. type a is usually responsible for the annual outbreaks that typically occur in the late fall and early winter. the influenza virus changes often so having flu caused by one strain does not give you full immunity to other strains. widespread outbreaks of the flu usually follow significant changes (called antigenic shifts) in the virus and occur about every 10 years. people who get the flu tend to become much sicker when a shift in the flu virus occurs. minor changes in the virus (called antigenic drifts) occur nearly every year. the virus is spread from person to person through: direct contact such as shaking hands. small droplets that form when a person sneezes or coughs. contact with objects such as handkerchiefs that have been in contact with fluids from an infected person's nose or throat. when are you contagious? people who have the flu are most likely to pass it to someone else from 1 day before to 5 days after symptoms develop. children may be infectious for up to 6 days before symptoms develop. symptoms usually develop 1 to 4 days after you are infected. because symptoms may not develop for a couple of days you may pass the flu to someone before you know you have it. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "well air is dryer in the winter and we usually wash our hands more often. that causes amazing dryness. i have a couple of suggestions for you. before bed and before you put your gloves on break (or bite) open a regular vitamin e capsule. put a little oil on each of the hurt places. it does a lot to help healing. works for cracked lips too. my other thing to do is always make sure you dry your hands off very thoroughly when you wash them. why is that? because leaving hands damp actually wicks more moisture out of them. so dry them really well and you will have less of that problem. good luck!"

    "Answer": "only women who no longer have a uterus should consider using estrogen-alone therapy (et). for women with a uterus the option they might consider is estrogen plus progestogen therapy (ept). progestogen is needed to protect the uterus and balance the effects of estrogen. using et alone for 5 or more years can more than triple the risk of developing cancer of the uterus but adding progestogen prevents the uterine lining (endometrium) from thickening and greatly reduces the cancer risk. then of course each woman must determine (with her healthcare provider) if ept is right for her."

    "Answer": "this is an interesting question and i'm glad you asked it. in order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it. in other words it's extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure. (it's not impossible but it's fairly rare. ) one good example is penicillin. millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects. many of those people today have penicillin allergies. that early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on. that could be what happened to you too. if a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart. allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time. so that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually. you also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots. i'd suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you. sorry you're going through this. it's difficult to give up a well-loved food."

    "Question": "with all the advances in fertility treatments how old is too old for a woman to try to get pregnant?",
    "Answer": "all women see a decline in their fertility beginning around age 35 making it far more difficult -- but not impossible -- to conceive naturally. the risk of birth defects including down syndrome increases as a woman ages as does the risk of an ectopic pregnancy which can be life-threatening. treatments such as in vitro fertilization have made it possible to conceive well into the mid-40s. for many doctors however the cutoff point is around age 45 a time when many believe a woman’s eggs are no longer healthy enough for a normal conception -- although normal pregnancies can and do occur at this age. with the inception of donor eggs a woman could actually carry a child and give birth well into her 60s and beyond depending on her individual health status. although this is possible it is not necessarily a recommended or accepted practice."

    "Answer": "how you would treat a heater burn would depend on many factors none of which you have shared in your question. here are some of them briefly. the location of the burn. a burn on the palm of the hand genitals or face would be treated differently than on on the leg. the extent of the burn. a burn that covers a large surface area would be more serious than one that involves a tiny area. the depth of the burn. a first degree burn is like a sunburn. a second degree burn has blisters. a third degree burn is very deep and considered among the more serious. first aid for most burns would be to cool down the skin rapidly with cold water ice etc. to make sure the burning does not continue. minor burns tend to be self-healing making sure they do not become infected. taking something for pain is often helpful. brief heater burns may fall into this category. the more serious and deeper burns and/or on those on sensitive areas should be seen by a medical provider as soon as possible. the most serious of burns go to special burn units of hospitals."

    "Answer": "you would need to have a consultation with a urologist. a specialist will need to see your scarring first-hand before discussing any cosmetic revisions. i say \"cosmetic\" since this is not a functional anomaly and insurances are unlikely to pay a penny to make your penis look better. while this may be beyond the normal requests for cosmetic surgeons who may or may not choose to due penile surgery it may be worth a consultation."

    "Question": "my husband has chronic asthma. is there a way to treat it without steroids? . his father died a disease that was aided by the bone erosion due to his asthma steriod use. my husband is still young and i was wondering if there was anything out there to help him.",
    "Answer": "yes of course. there are many ways to treat asthma without using steroids but remember that asthma is an inflammatory lung disorder and steroids really are a mainstay of treatment. high-dose (oral) steroid can cause problems but inhaled corticosteriods are considered safe and effective for long-term use. don't let the name \"steroid\" scare you or your husband. properly prescribed low-dose steroids are really like \"hydrocortisone cream for your lungs\". they relieve inflammation and it is the inflammation that is the real underlying issue with asthma. if you still do not want to use steroids then have a long talk with his treating medical provider. there are other treatment methods that can help. do not under-estimate asthma. uncontrolled asthma can result in some very serious manifestations. don't ever ignore it."

    "Question": "i get these sharp pains almost like something is blowing up in the back of my head? . its happens rarely like once or but when it does it really freaks me out because it happens when i'm turning my head and it feels like something inside my brain is popping/blowing up and then when i feel the back of my head with my hand its really hot. and i've tried moving my head in the same direction again but it doesn't repeat its self it seems as if its just really random. do you have any idea what would be causing this?",
    "Answer": "certainly this is something worth investigating. it's impossible to tell what may be causing this without a physical examination but one possibility that comes to mind is disc degeneration in the spine. i'd suggest you start by consulting your primary health care provider. he or she can do a physical examination and possibly take an x-ray to determine if you have arthritis in your neck vertebrae or possibly degenerative disc disease. if you do your provider can discuss treatment options with you. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "the cause of bipolar disorder is not well understood although evidence suggests that the disorder runs in families. 3 your living environment and family situation may also play a role in the disorder. episodes of depression and mania may be caused by a problem with certain brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. antidepressant medicines can trigger a manic episode in a person who has bipolar disorder. but this may occur before someone is diagnosed with bipolar disorder while he or she is seeking treatment for an episode of depression. sleep deprivation or substance abuse including caffeine can cause a person with bipolar disorder to have a manic episode. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "we all have a genetic blueprint to how our big or small are body is supposed to be. when we eat healthy eat mindfully (meaning we don't eat past fullness often) and are active weight tends to take care of itself. if you are healthy (good blood pressure cholesterol etc. ) and not overweight there is no reason to get to an ideal weight. if you need to starve to get there then that tells me that is not the right weight for you. we are not all meant to be small and there is nothing magical about the ideal weight numbers. so my advice is that you focus on your healthy lifestyle and accepting your body as it is. you could focus more on different exercises and ways to increase fitness such as feeling stronger but i see no reason why you need to lose weight. i know our society says otherwise but spending all that energy on a weight that seems right for you may not be the best use of your time. best of health to you! i am not a fitness expert although i work for them but i wanted to offer an answer from my own personal experience. i had this same question not to long ago. i exercise 3-4 times a week eat healthy have 4 kids and 3 dogs who i run after or with all day long! but i was stuck at my target weight. i'm 5'6 i wanted to be 145. made it down to 165 from almost 190 about 6 months ago. my trainer also a good friend of mine said i needed to stop looking at the scale and focus on what was most important. being healthy and enjoying life. just as the last expert answer states. everyone is different. i stopped looking at the scale and put my efforts into enjoying the activities i love best and eating healthy but not limiting myself from foods i love or starving myself. i also change up my exercise routine regularly. i started doing hiit (you can google it) high intensity training classes. wow definitely felt the difference. about a week ago i went to my annual physical and weighed in for the 1st time in months. i was 155. i must be doing something right but what's different now is my outlook on my body and lifestyle. weight is just a number what's important to me is how i feel and having the energy to keep up with my very active family. it sounds like you are on the right path to a healthy fit life style. i wish you all the best and don't sweat the small stuff. enjoy life and save the sweat for the gym! <positive_smiley> -angel"

    "Question": "how can i tell if my child has head lice and what do they look like?",
    "Answer": "head lice are really uncomfortable to see. i think most parents go through this at some point with their kids going to school and the only way to find it is to really look very closely at your child's scalp. so in school it's very hard for these children not to have contact with each other share brushes hats scarves and that's really how it's spread. so as much as possible if you can instruct your kid not to share these products with their friends that would be a great start and a great way to prevent it. but beyond that you just have to examine your child's scalp very closely. what you will typically find rather than the active lice is nits. what nits look like they really look like flakes of dandruff except that when you try to remove it it won't come off the hair because what the lice do the nits are the eggs from the lice that will hatch within a week or so so what the lice do is they create this little capsule and they glue it to the hair and that's how it sticks. so it's very hard to take it off. the problem is i have parents come in and they say well but my child would shampoo their scalp everyday. and that makes it worse because when the hair is that clean the glue sticks better. so you are almost better off having a greasy scalp because it's harder for that nit to stick to the scalp. so it's not a matter of cleanliness at all. but once those nits are attached to the scalp you really have to get a prescription treatment to help get rid of it. there is a prescription called ovide that you put on to the scalp leave it on for a few hours and then shampoo it out and repeat it in a week to get rid of any nits that might have hatched by then."

    "Answer": "prostatitis should not cause redness/soreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct. there is likely another cause. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet based solely on your very brief description. you will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this redness/soreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis. you may want to consider seeing a urologist."

    "Answer": "if you are a parent and your child is getting ready to return to school after a long stretch of vacation time you know that that the first week is typically a serious struggle. ever wonder why? a few reasons: * if you have a teenager their body clock naturally wants to stay up later and sleep in later so you are really going against nature on that one. * if your child had a later bedtime over the summer than during than the school year their sleep pressure (like hunger but for sleep) is less earlier in the evening rather than later and going to sleep at their “school year” bedtime will be harder. * finally remember there is always an adjustment period to any big change and it is often pretty painful. so how much sleep should your child get? * toddlers (1-3 years): 12-14 hours of sleep once they reach 18 months naps will decrease to once per day. * preschoolers (3-5 years): 11-13 hours they usually lose their nap by age 5. * school-aged kids (5-12 years): 10-11 hours. * teens (13-19 years): 9-10 hours. here are a few tips and tricks i have used with my patients over the years to make the transition from summer to school a bit smoother: * about 2 weeks before school starts have your child go to bed 15 minutes earlier than they normally do then after three days of this make it 30 minutes and so on until they are within 30 minutes of what should be their normal bedtime. * begin to limit or eliminate caffeine intake by about 2:30 p. m. many people do not know that caffeine can stay in your system for 10 hours (this includes energy drinks as well). check the label on some vitamin waters –- they may have caffeine. * even if you cannot get your children to go to bed any earlier (which you really should try) get them waking up closer and closer to their school time wake-up time. this will help provide an anchor to their already shifting biological rhythm. * exercising each day will certainly help their sleep so keep them outside as long as you can (use sunscreen) and in the pool so they will be nice and tired (particularly for younger children) for bed. remember to make the bedroom dark as in many cases you may be asking them to go to bed before the sun has completely set. * if they are into electronics in the evenings start to have them “unplugged and powered down” an hour before bed. have them relaxing reading and getting back into a bedtime routine."

    "Question": "what foods do you know of that can trigger gout attacks?",
    "Answer": "first make sure you are seeing a physician who specializes in gout management such as a rheumatologist. there are medications to treat the inflammation associated with gout flares. there are also medications that exist to treat the underlying metabolic condition called hyperuricimia which is too much uric acid in the blood. dietary management of gout is limited but important to help control the buildup of uric acid in the blood. a low-purine diet is often recommended for people with gout. laura rall phd nutrition researcher at tufts university in boston says \"begin by eliminating foods in the 'high-purine' category while reducing your intake of foods in the 'moderate-purine' category. if you don't have gout attacks after trying this you may add more foods from the 'moderate' category or occasionally try a food from the 'high' category. using these guidelines you may be able to determine a safe level of purine consumption and enjoy some of your favorite foods without experiencing attacks. \" foods considered high in purine content include all types of alcoholic beverages; some fish seafood and shellfish such as anchovies sardines herring mussels codfish scallops trout and haddock; and certain meats such as bacon turkey veal venison and organ meats like liver. foods considered moderate in purine content include meats such as beef chicken duck pork and crab lobster oysters and shrimp; and vegetables and beans such as asparagus kidney beans lentils lima beans mushrooms and spinach."

    "Answer": "healthy ldl cholesterol ranges are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). an ldl of 100-129 mg/dl is near-optimal. your doctor can determine if medication is recommended to lower ldl values. here are some other ways to lower ldl: exercise more often. exercise can play a large role in decreasing triglyceride levels. experts recommend at least 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week. lose weight. weight loss can be a result from exercise and diet changes. eating fewer calories can help you to lose weight. a diet that is high in fruits vegetables lean proteins and low-fat dairy products can help to decrease your caloric intake. choose healthy fats. eat less unhealthy fats (found in meats butter dairy products) and trans fats (found in processed foods and margarine). healthy fats are found in olive oil nuts and seeds. eating more of these foods are helpful at lower cholesterol. this is because of the omega-3 fatty acids (also found in tuna salmon and mackerel). for more information click on this link."

    "Answer": "yes as the nail grows an ingrown toenail can heal itself. sometimes. so yes you were fortunate that this happened to you. most ingrown nails are caused by improper nail trimming. the toenails should not be trimmed round like the fingernails. toenails should be trimmed more or less square avoiding cutting them too deep on the sides. unlike the hands feet are stuffed into shoes most of the day and this compression also tends to be problematic for some people. make sure your shoes fit well and stop digging at your toenails when you trim them!"

    "Answer": "migraines similar to other health conditions can be influenced by weather. studies have shown that humidity temperature change and barometric pressure changes can cause headache symptoms to get worse. additionally stress and lack of good sleep can provoke headaches. certainly october with the holidays approaching can be a stressful time for many people. although weather can't be controlled you can try to prevent headaches by taking care of yourself with rest reducing stress and exercise. enough sleep has been proven to be beneficial in prevention of headaches. remember to eat well also and exercise regularly. exercise releases endorphins (feel good chemicals) and it has been shown to be beneficial in prevention of migraines. migraines can be very difficult on you and your family. but taking care of yourself by exercising eating well and sleeping could help prevent them. if you are having migraines frequently or are concerned be sure to speak to your doctor. i read that migraines can be seasonal but it is better described that you may suffer migraines more in a particular season. environmental factors that can trigger a migraine include a change in climate or weather (such as a change in humidity or temperature) a change in altitude or barometric pressure high winds traveling or a change in routine. often seasons bring on a new set of stresses as a parent my stress level went up during the fall because of my children going back to school the change in routine etc. your daughter might be having the same issue. also fall brings about different allergy triggers what can be precieved as a migraine could be a sinus head-ache. here is an interesting article about the sinus-migraine relationship: <link> winter has it's set of stresses like the holidays which is rumoured as being the most stressful times of the year with the added change in weather especially for those living in snow bound states. i hope you feel better! i am a migraine sufferer and i can attest that my migraines are influenced by weather. i live in southern california in a region called the inland empire about 45 miles east of l. a. our weather here is very hot and dry during the summer with no rain or moisture. sometime around mid oct to early nov we get our first rain or at least moist weather. i can always count on getting a migraine at that time. then we go through a rainy season between nov and may. when the rainy season ends i can usually count on a migraine usually around april or may during the first heat wave of the year (about 85 degrees and above). although i get migraines sporadically throughout the year those definite weather changes are a constant in my own migraine frequency. if the weather changes suddenly in anyway i am usually affected unless the weather is changing back and forth in shorter intervals. during the summer when it is hot and dry for weeks at a time then all of a sudden we have one day of humidity (which is rare in so so cal but iot happens) i will get a migraine. there is definietely a connection to the foods i eat as well. i think foods with preservatives may have an affect but i haven't totally narrowed that one down as well as the weather constant. also stress combined with the factors mentioned above will always worsen my migraines. i hope this is of some help to other migraine sufferers. -lp"

    "Question": "how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me? can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time? . how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair?",
    "Answer": "this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there. so i will try to address all of them for you. first of all the sooner you start using the products; whether it's rogaine and/or propecia the better off you are because it's much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards. so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed; whether it's in the temple area or in the crown that's when you start going. the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone. so it doesn't become like one and one is two it's more like one and one is four or five. so they are that much better together. it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them. so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point."

    "Answer": "hi it could be possible but sperm that's been in your mouth the acids in your mouth could kill it but then this was straight after your period? but then chuck in that some women can get pregnant from anytime of the month its a bit of a mine field. just one last thing have you done an hpt? or had a doctor do a pregnancy test? or it could be just a skipped period it does happen. things to think about. good luck"

    "Question": "length of drugs in system. how long does vicoden stay in your system? (need a negative drug test)",
    "Answer": "obviously the best way to get a negative drug test is not take drugs including vicodin unless it was specifically prescribed for you for a medical condition. in this case disclose that you are taking it and why. vicodin or hydrocodone can remain in your system for four days or even longer depending on your dosage and ability to clear it and of course the sensitivity of the laboratory testing (they are getting better and better). a urine drug screen should be fine after about a week if you want a margin of safety. if they do a hair analysis opiates can be detected for months. the goal of a drug screen is to make sure you are not taking drugs that could interfere with your safety or the safety of others so if you are taking vicodin that has not been prescribed to you or taking it recreationally you need to re-evaluate this dangerous practice."

    "Answer": "ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache dental pain menstrual cramps muscle aches or arthritis. it is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. this effect helps to decrease swelling pain or fever. if you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. the manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. also products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. taking the wrong product could harm you."

    "Answer": "in all probability what you're experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer. that said the full answer is a bit more complicated. the fact you're having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag. i'd suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated. obviously you don't want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin. even if you've had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated. with luck it will turn out to be something simple but you'll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this. good luck to you! regardless of your age clothes rubbing on your nipples can cause irritation. my wife was having the same problem. i suggested clear double sided tape. as crazy as it sounds it worked."

    "Answer": "a crush injury can cause some considerable soft-tissue damage and that may not be evident on a plain x-ray or even on an examination. yes fractures can be missed by the person reading them and the radiologist so repeat x-rays are often ordered. however if your injury was severe and you are having that array of symptoms seeing an orthopedist or a hand-specialist may be a logical next step. at has only been three days so things may still settle down with cold compresses and anti-inflammatory medications but there is nothing inappropriate in arranging an orthopedic consultation for next week."

    "Question": "does resveratrol really work?",
    "Answer": "resveratrol which is a compound found largely in the skins of red grapes has gained a lot of media attention and has been touted as having many beneficial health effects. resveratrol is a component of ko-jo-kon an oriental medicine used to treat diseases of the blood vessels heart and liver. it came to scientific attention during the mid-90s as a possible explanation for the “french paradox” — the low incidence of heart disease among the french people who eat a relatively high-fat diet. since then it has been touted by manufacturers and examined by scientific researchers as an antioxidant anti-cancer agent and phytoestrogen. it has also been advertised online as “the french paradox in a bottle. ” if you do a literature search and look at well-accepted peer review journals there is very little published to support any of these effects of resveratrol. new work produced by both amgen and pfizer has cast doubt on the manner in which the health supplement is said to work. prominent researchers supposed that it worked by activating a certain gene sirt1. this activation is thought to produce the benefits of a caloric restriction diet even among those with high fat and high caloric intake. in 2009 in chemical biology and drug design amgen scientists published experimental results that indicate resveratrol does not in fact activate sirt1. pfizer scientists in the journal of biological chemistry in 2010 offered similar results showing that resveratrol (and related substances such as srt1720) do not active sirt1 and did not reduce blood sugar in mice fed a high-fat diet. thus it suggests that resveratrol doesn’t work at all (though it’s not possible to translate mice studies into human studies). despite what is promoted on many national television shows on health none of the claims has been demonstrated in any valid human study. while present in other plants such as eucalyptus spruce and lily and in other foods such as mulberries and peanuts resveratrol’s most abundant natural sources are vitis vinifera labrusca and muscadine grapes which are used to make wines. it occurs in the vines roots seeds and stalks but its highest concentration is in the skin. the resveratrol content of wine is related to the length of time the grape skins are present during the fermentation process. thus the concentration is significantly higher in red wine than in white wine because the skins are removed earlier during white-wine production lessening the amount that is extracted. grape juice which is not a fermented beverage is not a significant source of resveratrol. since wine is the most notable dietary source it is the object of much speculation and research. resveratrol is also available from supplement pills and liquids in which it is sometimes combined with vitamins and/or other ingredients. it is also an ingredient in topical skin creams. the supplements are generally labeled as containing from 20 to 500 mg per tablet or capsule. however the purity of these products is unknown. and because dietary supplements are loosely regulated it should not be assumed that the labeled dosage is accurate."

    "Answer": "if you have researched shingles you ought to know that once you pass 30 days +/- you are in a different category of suffering namely post-therapeutic neuralgia which may last indefinitely. i have had mine for a little over two years. the virus infects the spinal cord nerve cells at a particular junction then spreads along a nerve pathway called a dermatome. not much can be done without going to extreme drug prescriptions and/or surgery. if the pain dissipates and becomes mid to light in discomfort i found that ice applications and/or direct pressure will \"turn-off\" the pain by sending the brain a different nerve message. aspercreme works for light to mild discomfort lidocaine topically applied handled it when it was a little more intense. sorry about your mom i know how very painful shingles can be but hopefully hers will abate in intensity with time---not very encouraging i know but there it is. by the way in talking to medical personnel i was told the shot does not prevent shingles but only softens the blow at best---and there has been an increase in shingles infections with the shots. i am not a doctor but this info came from medical professionals in the field. prays for you and your mom."

    "Answer": "hi try this if you got your period today you're not pregnant. sore nipples arise when oestrogen becomes dominant in your system. your body released more oestrogen because you were going to have your period in two weeks. in order to have a period your body release another hormone progesterone which simultaneously starts the flow and stops any fertilization of remaining egg follicles. you could have sore nipples all through your period this time. oestrogen can make you nauseated. you are not pregnant. you just need to learn more about the process your body goes through preparing for menstruation. something may have stimulated the excess oestrogen in your system. it could be just your body changing or even food containing animal oestrogen. hope this helps your problem in some way. good luck"

    "Answer": "hi try this it may help during the third week after the first day of your last period your fertilised egg moves along the fallopian tube towards the womb. the egg begins as a single cell which divides again and again. by the time the egg reaches the womb it has become a mass of more than 100 cells called an embryo. once in the womb the embryo burrows into the lining of the womb. this is called implantation. now by doing this it can cause some bleeding so perhaps that is what your getting. do hope this helps. good luck"

    "Question": "why is it important to screen patients with gerd to diagnose barrett's esophagus?",
    "Answer": "unfortunately most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively. by the time cancer-related symptoms of chest pain weight loss and progressive difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) lead to the diagnosis the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs. indeed there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in barrett's esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after cancer symptoms prompted medical attention. therefore physicians want to make the diagnosis of barrett's in gerd patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients. the problem however as mentioned previously is that only 5% of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have barrett's esophagus. thus the challenge is to identify those gerd patients who have barrett's by screening patients with chronic gerd. yet sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with gerd should be screened by endoscopy. for now until more data becomes available it seems reasonable that if a patient with gerd cannot be taken off acid-suppressing drugs after two to three years (because of persistent symptoms) an endoscopy should be done to see if barrett's esophagus is present. one endoscopy per lifetime in patients with gerd may be sufficient to screen for barrett's."

    "Question": "i lost my brother to breast cancer. since having children i still get some milk out of the nipple. is this normal?",
    "Answer": "it is important for women to know that breast cancer can be a man's disease as well. this also means that a genetic link can come from a male relative. fortunately the symptom you describe is not likely to be linked to breast cancer risk. it is not uncommon for women to be able to get small amounts of nipple discharge after having breastfed. the usual triggers for this to occurs are: nipple stimulation a a part of sexual foreplay hot showers birth control pills or \"checking for discharge\" by repeated squeezing. sometimes women will notice discharge from one or both nipples. this prompts concern especially if she has not recently breast fed. generally we tell women that bilateral white or clear discharge which is only present with nipple stimulation is likely to be \"normal. \" as mentioned above being on birth control pills can sometimes enhance breast discharge. certain psychiatric medications—especially the antipsychotics —can initiate nipple discharge. bilateral spontaneous secretions can be prompted by a pituitary problem or hypothyroidism. both low thyroid and elevated prolactin (from the pituitary gland) can be checked for using simple blood tests. the most concerning nipple discharges are those which are red/bloody unilateral and coming from just one or two ducts. if you were my patient i would check a sample of the discharges for undiscernable blood (using the fecal blood card). i would do a careful breast exam and might send you for a mammogram or ultrasound—depending upon your age. i prefer to be safe rather than sorry--even when the discharge sounds non-pathologic. so get it checked out even though it is likely that you will be told it is ok."

    "Answer": "your question is an important one for women with epilepsy who wish to have a family. there is little scientific information on this subject and most of what we know if based on clinical experience of doctors taking care of women with epilepsy. the bottom line is that most physicians with expertise in managing epilepsy encourage their patients to breastfeed even if they are taking anti-seizure medicine. the baby has developed for nine months in the presence of the anti-seizure medicine and as such for the baby to continue to be exposed to it after delivery usually does not create problems. i am unaware of any [known] descriptions of problems with breastfeeding while on trileptal (oxcarbazepine). if blood levels are done in mom and her baby while breastfeeding the baby's level will be around half of the mother's. so the baby is definitely getting some of the drug but it usually does not create problems as best we tell. so if breastfeeding is important to you (as it is for most women) most experts in the field would encourage you to breastfeed."

    "Question": "can epidural cause hemorrhoids",
    "Answer": "the short answer is: no. epidural anesthesia is used in a variety of situations. it is performed by infusing numbing medicine very close to the spinal nerve roots which makes them temporarily unable to transmit pain signals to the brain. the effect on the patient is the \"blocked\" area of the body losing all sensation. epidural anesthesia is most notably used in childbirth but it's also used to numb the lower abdomen or legs for surgery. once i watched a knee replacement surgery performed on a patient who was wide awake but had epidural anesthesia that made him unable to feel his leg. pretty cool! but to your question. there's no evidence epidural anesthesia would cause hemorrhoids or make them worse. hemorrhoids usually take quite some time to develop and are a result of straining too hard to have bowel movements. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "adolescence is a volatile time: both socially and biologically. a lot of profound changes are taking place. it's especially important that once a child hits puberty he or she go back to the doctor for a check-up. it's possible that the physical changes of puberty may mean that your teen's medication needs to be adjusted. a lot of parents find that their teenager wants to stop taking medication. some teens with epilepsy feel like they no longer need epilepsy drugs or they don't want to be controlled by a drug. it's important that you make clear to your teen the risk of stopping medication. teens may need to be reminded what it was like when they had regular seizures. also if they haven't had a seizure in some time point out that the reason may be that their drugs are working. teenage years are often a time when standing out is the last thing a child wants. a lot of kids feel painfully awkward and it can be worse for teenagers with epilepsy. they may be embarrassed by their condition. they may be terrified of having a seizure in public. they may also not like the side effects of their medication which may affect their concentration or their physical appearance. it's important to get any of these concerns checked out with a doctor. it's possible that a change in medicine could ease some of their concerns. depression is a bigger problem among teenagers with epilepsy than previously thought says william r. turk md chief of the neurology division at the nemours children's clinic in jacksonville florida. if you think your child might be depressed it's important to get help. for parents some of the emotional preparation for the teenage years can start early. any parent of a child with epilepsy should work hard to establish a \"climate of trust \" turk says. if you have an open and honest relationship with your child when she's young you may feel more comfortable with her independence as she grows older. on the other hand if you're always isolating your kids or imposing restrictions on them they may be more likely to rebel when they get older."

    "Question": "had sex with my fiance last night. after we finished i noticed he had a tick on his penis. my fiance and i went on a hike on a pennsylvania trail 2 days ago. we had sex last night. after we finished i noticed he had a tick on his penis. we removed it and went to sleep. this morning there seems to be a bump where the tick was. are we both at risk of getting lime disease?",
    "Answer": "the risk of lyme disease would depend on the type of tick (tiny deer ticks are the usual culprit not dog or wood ticks) and if you live in an area that has a lot of lyme cases. if you had saved the tick the local health department may be able to check it for you. since i suspect you did not i would suggest that you all your local health department (i don't know where you live) for some better local advice or have your fiance call his medical provider. you really do not enough information at this time to determine individual risk. i found a tick on my penis back in the summer. how it got there i have no clue. anyway i removed it and a small bump remained. i suspect it was the tick's head still imbedded in my skin and the bump was my body slowly absorbing it. yes it's disgusting and frightening to think of a parasite attaching itself to my genitals but ultimately the bump went away in about a week or so with no lasting effects. no lyme disease. you're probably ok but you could always go to the doctor for advice just so he or she can inform you about what symptoms of lyme disease to look for."

    "Question": "is it ok to fast while taking coumadin?",
    "Answer": "this is an excellent question and one you should ask your doctor. warfarin (brand name: coumadin) is a \"blood thinning\" medication that is used to slow down the time it takes your blood to clot. warfarin is used for certain medical issues including atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis (dvt). the effectiveness of warfarin is very much dependent on the foods you eat. some studies have shown that fasting can make warfarin less effective. this means if you fast while taking warfarin you could be at increased risk for developing a blood clot. some religions mandate periods of fasting and a person on warfarin does not need to choose between honoring his religious beliefs and maintaining the therapeutic benefits of warfarin. tell your doctor about periods of fasting you anticipate participating in and your physician may opt to monitor your blood work more closely and adjust your dose to keep you safe. if you are considering fasting for some other reason i would advise you talk to your doctor before you do so. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "can you take too much protein (as in protein shakes food vitamins etc? )",
    "Answer": "there is a pretty wide acceptable range of protein recommended by the institute of medicine from 10-35% of calories. for a 2000 calorie diet that would be 50g to 175g. for the average healthy person high levels of protein in the diet is usually not an issue although there is some evidence that protein intake 2-3 times the recommended amount contributes to urinary calcium loss and could predispose someone to bone loss. people with renal (kidney) problems and diabetics who are at increased risk for such issues should not consume excess protein. the bigger issue is that if protein is high fat and carbohydrate intake also change. a balance of all three macronutrients is important for good health including healthy carbs (45-65% such as fruits vegetables whole grains and bean/legumes and healthy fats (20-35%)such as vegetable oil avocados nuts and seeds. diets that exclude entire food groups are not recommended by health professionals. seeing a registered dietitian can help you get personalized counseling on the right amount of protein for you. for more on protein needs see this helpful webmd article <link>"

    "Question": "for a while know i have always had either constipation or diarrhea and in pain - i also suffer anxiety and panic attacks. can anyone help or tell me what i should do? <negative_smiley><negative_smiley>",
    "Answer": "it's difficult to say if these things are interrelated. you might have constipation/diarrhea even if you didn't have anxiety/panic attacks. let's take on the bowel problem first. whenever your bowels aren't behaving themselves you should start with the basics: make sure you eat plenty of foods rich in fiber. these can include fruits (including dried fruit) vegetables and whole grains. fiber helps move material through your intestines. if you don't get enough fiber you can become constipated. make sure you're drinking enough water. dehydration can lead to constipation. interestingly while too little fiber can cause constipation it also can lead to loose stools or diarrhea. if you have loose stools try increasing your fiber intake. but stay away from fruits temporarily because eating fruit in large quantities can give you very loose stools. make sure you're exercising. exercise (including walking) can literally help \"get things moving\" in your bowels if you're constipated. and exercise in general will help your body (including your bowels) function better. if eating plenty of fiber drinking plenty of water and getting exercise don't solve your bowel issues then you should consult a medical professional. it's possible you have irritable bowel syndrome or another condition that can (or needs to) be treated with medication. regarding the anxiety and panic attacks if you're not under the care of a psychologist for these conditions then i suggest you see someone. anxiety is very treatable today. and since panic attacks often arise from unchecked anxiety treating your anxiety may make the panic attacks go away. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "some clinicians are just more gentle than others. for women i would suggest a female provider (md pa or nurse practitioner). not that men cannot be gentle (i am a man) but a woman provider should be much more sympathetic to your concerns. make the appointment and then call them personally a day or so before your exam to discuss your concerns. knowing that you have had a bad experience in the past should make them more understanding take their time and make this important exam less-stressful for you. a small amount of bleeding can be expected with a pap sometimes but certainly the clinician can be a bit more gentle with the bimanual examination when feeling your uterus cervix and ovarian areas."

    "Answer": "yes as a matter of fact there are. the human lymphatic system is fascinating in that it runs from head to toe almost like a second circulatory system though it doesn't circulate whole blood. the lymph system contains lymphatic fluid excess blood plasma lymphocytes and other white blood cells and cellular waste and debris. the lymphatic system is a major component of the immune system. believe it or not the tonsils and spleen are actually part of the lymph system. a lymph \" node \" is a large ball of lymph tissue. it's not exactly a gland or an organ but it filters the material contained in the lymphatic fluid that flows in and out of the node. the body contains hundreds and hundreds of lymph node scattered along the byways of the lymphatic system. lymph nodes tend to be clustered in several areas and one of these is the clavicle (collarbone). lymph nodes can be found all along the collarbone extending from the sternum to the shoulder area. it is not uncommon for lymph nodes to become enlarged (or swell) when the body is fighting an infection or some other threat. sometimes a swollen lymph node can be an important signal to doctors that you have a serious medical issue. fortunately that's not usually the case. more often lymph nodes swell temporarily and then go back down. it's a usual part of life. it's always worthwhile to have an enlarged lymph node examined by a medical professional. both adults and children can get swollen lymph nodes and it's always a good reason to seek medical care. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "my grandkids have not had chickenpox or the vaccine i have just started to blister should i stay away from them? . i was just told this morning i have shingles",
    "Answer": "yes. the same virus the varicella zoster virus causes both chicken pox and shingles. so someone with shingles can give the virus to someone who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. with shingles the virus is transmitted by contact with the fluid from the blisters. shingles is not as contagious as chickenpox which can be spread through droplets in the air as well as by casual contact. the risk of spreading the virus when you have shingles is low if you keep all the blisters covered. once the blisters have all crusted over you will no longer be contagious. this usually happens within 7 to 10 days. here is what the cdc recommends to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus if you have shingles: • cover the rash • avoid touching or scratching the blisters • wash your hands frequently • avoid contact with pregnant women who have not had chicken pox or the vaccine premature babies and people with weakened immune systems to be on the safe side i would avoid contact with the grandkids until all the blisters are crusted over. you will be able to enjoy your grandchildren soon enough when you are feeling better."

    "Answer": "in general the answer is: yes. but let me clarify a couple of things. first are you positive you have a yeast infection? if the single-dose monistat hasn't improved your symptoms you may be dealing with something other than a yeast infection. you can probably try another over-the-counter product for yeast infection to see if that clears things up. but if it doesn't i'd advise a trip to the doctor for a good diagnosis. contrary to popular opinion eating yogurt with lactobacillus acidophilus cultures generally does not help a yeast infection. some women take lactobacillus acidophilus to help treat bacterial vaginosis but this is not useful. it's true acidophilus is the primary \"good\" bacteria of the vagina but research shows dairy-based versions of this bacteria generally don't have any effect on the flora of the vagina. also it's worth mentioning some women believe putting yogurt into the vagina will help cure a yeast infection. not true. don't do it. i've not heard of using garlic to treat a yeast infection. again i would not put it in the vagina. that could have serious negative consequences! hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. of course it's tough for your father too. unfortunately there's no good answer to your question. none of us knows when any individual will pass on whether they have cancer or not. some cancers are very aggressive and others move more slowly. also every individual's body is different in the way it fights off a disease like cancer. a person with a very robust immune system may live longer with the same type of cancer as another person whose immune system is weak. what i can tell you for certain is this: make the most of every remaining moment with your dad. that way whether he lives for three days or three years you won't let go with any regrets. sending you big hugs."

    "Question": "how are cortisone injections of soft tissues given?",
    "Answer": "the medical professional administering the injection draws up the corticosteroid into a syringe. a local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) may simultaneously be drawn into the syringe. next the area to be injected is selected. typically the skin over the area to be injected is sterilized with a liquid solution either alcohol or betadine. sometimes the area is topically anesthetized by rapid cooling using a spray such as ethyl chloride. the needle of the syringe then is inserted into the tissue to be injected and the solution is ejected from the syringe into the area of inflammation. the needle then is withdrawn and a sterile bandage is applied to the injection site."

    "Answer": "my friend i am sorry but there are no vegetables or over the counter medications that can slow down your heart rate. i would suggest telling your screening doctor that you are very anxious and that you suspect it is anxiety because lets be honest. its pretty intimidating. 85 as a resting heart rate is pretty fast but can be normal. for long term solutions i would try running or doing some sort of cardiovascular exercise. this can reduce anxiety and get your heart into shape which will lower your resting heart rate. for short term results. breathing exercises it is."

    "Answer": "i have to say that being overweight is definitely a factor but there are soooo many reasons for shortness of breath in children that it would be wrong to just attribute it to his weight. his doctor needs to do some pulmonary function tests or refer him to someone who can do this. shortness of breath due to exercise can be cardiac (heart) as well as an example. he may need more than just a rescue inhaler like albuterol to manage this problem but you would be wise to take his medical evaluation up a notch."

    "Question": "will clindamycin hcl treat a bladder infection?",
    "Answer": "if you're thinking about self-medicating don't do it. have you been diagnosed with a \"bladder infection \" or did you self-diagnose this? if a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection. as you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections. an antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected. when a person decides to self-diagnose and self-medicate they do themselves a grave disservice. in taking a \"leftover\" antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment. this can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications. if you believe you have a urinary tract infection (much more likely than a \"bladder\" infection) i suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center. they will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic. many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a uti or bladder infection. even if you'd had a uti before do not assume you \"know\" that's what's causing your symptoms. only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "condoms do prevent some but not all stds. herpes can be transmitted from skin to skin contact. anal sex can cause tiny tears in the lining of the rectum or anus and make you more prone to infection. i suspect you will be fine since the condom was intact and you appear to have been careful. having \"anonymous\" sex with anyone is risky however since you do not know if he is hiv positive or has an std."

    "Question": "can being a cf carrier cause copd symptoms to accelerated?",
    "Answer": "that's a good question. i can see why you might make that connection since both cystic fibrosis (cf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) involve the lungs. cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus throughout the body to become thick and sticky. this becomes very evident in the lungs where there's a lot of mucus. in order to get cf a child must inherit a gene defect from both parents. if only one parent passes along the gene mutation that causes cf the child is called a cf \"carrier\" because if he or she has a child with another person who is a cf carrier their child will have cystic fibrosis. if you are a cf carrier you do not have the disease and cannot get the disease. cf is not in any way related to copd which is usually caused by external factors such as smoking tobacco. copd is not an inherited disease and cannot be \"caught\" from another person. copd is not in any way related to -- or associated with -- carrying the cystic fibrosis gene mutation. if a cystic fibrosis carrier develops copd this is in no way related to the person's genetic status and the cf gene mutation in no way affects the individual's copd. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "couples who use the pull-out method for birth control often become parents. this is not an effective contraceptive technique since viable sperm leaks out in semen before full ejaculation occurs. you need to start using condoms 100% of the time or another form of birth control that is known to be more effective. with that said yes you do need to do a pregnancy test. if it is negative repeat it again in a week or so. tests taken too early in a pregnancy may be falsely negative. being late for four days is usually not a big deal but when you are not practicing an effective birth control method this could end up being a big deal."

    "Answer": "unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care."

    "Question": "why is sperm washed in infertility treatments and what are the downsides?",
    "Answer": "well when a couple is going in and it turns out that the numbers are pretty good but she’s still not getting pregnant but she’s ovulating ok one of the techniques is called intrauterine insemination. iui what we do is we take the sperm specimen from the man what we do is we wash away all the accessory fluids and just retain the sperm and that’s instilled up on the top of the woman’s uterus on the day she’s ovulating. that way the sperm are there much closer to the egg and it improves the chances of conception. the problem is the wash is very operator dependent. if you get a technician who doesn’t know what he or she is doing or doesn’t care or uses the wrong technique then you could start off with a great numbers and great quality highly motile happy sperm and end up with abysmal numbers which means chances for success are low. so the problem is the art of the wash really has fallen by the wayside with advances in more complicated and modern techniques of in-vitro fertilization. how could the technician not care? because that’s the problem is a lot of technicians aren’t trained. we had one lady once who brought us numbers before and after the wash and the numbers afterwards were abysmal. so we called the doctor’s office and asked who did the wash and what technique was used? so a nurse came on the line and she said yeah i rented a video from a medical source and i watched the video on how to do the wash it was her first and she watched it on a monday and then they did the specimen. so it’s really a very technical procedure and if you don’t know any better if you’ve not been trained to realize that there are different washes you can do and what an ideal number should be then you’re not going to know any better."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. the good news is it's probably not serious. if this were appendicitis the pain would be on the right side not the left and it would be pretty ouchy. it likely wouldn't be something described as \"mild pain. \" sometimes when a person becomes active as you have they get very in tune with their body -- and that can magnify their perception of even minor changes twinges in their state of being. it's not unusual for a person to experience minor aches and pains throughout any given day. it could be you simply never noticed these things before and now you do. another possibility is gas passing through the large intestine or even a piece of hard stool moving along. these situations can produce a mild pain in the left abdominal area. the fatigue and lightheadedness could be mild dehydration or (as you suspected) some sort of fluctuation in your blood sugar levels. if the pain persists or if you develop a fever then you should see a doctor. and by the way keep up the great work with healthy eating and exercising. it sounds like you've really been making an effort. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what could be causing breast soreness after my period if i know i'm not pregnant?",
    "Answer": "it is most probably due to hormones --- unless you have some other cause for breast tenderness such as starting to work out a severe respiratory infection (chest wall inflammation) etc. you mentioned that you did not have your usual breast soreness before this period. it arrived after the flow. my best guess is that your last \"period\" may not have been linked to an ovulation. classically periods caused by ovulations have the most prominent premenstrual symptoms (breast pain cramps etc). also if you missed an ovulation last month you have been exposed to continued levels of estrogen. estrogen has been a purported cause of breast tenderness and enlargement. hopefully this is just a temporary thing. if the bilateral breast pain persists or you develop other symptoms such as the pain and blistering of shingles on the chest you should see your gyn or clinic for a breast exam."

    "Question": "what are the causes of the flu?",
    "Answer": "the flu (influenza) viruses influenza viruses cause the flu and are divided into three types designated a b and c. influenza types a and b are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death. influenza type c differs from types a and b in some important ways. type c infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public-health impact of influenza types a and b. efforts to control the impact of influenza are aimed at types a and b and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. influenza viruses continually change over time usually by mutation (change in the viral rna). this constant changing often enables the virus to evade the immune system of the host (humans birds and other animals) so that the host is susceptible to changing influenza virus infections throughout life. this process works as follows: a host infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes the \"first\" antibody no longer recognizes the \"newer\" virus and infection can occur because the host does not recognize the new flu virus as a problem until the infection is well under way. the first antibody developed may in some instances provide partial protection against infection with a new influenza virus. in 2009 almost all individuals had no antibodies that could recognize the novel h1n1 virus immediately. type a viruses are divided into types based on differences in two viral surface proteins called the hemagglutinin (h) and the neuraminidase (n). there are at least 16 known h subtypes and nine known n subtypes. these surface proteins can occur in many combinations. when spread by droplets or direct contact the virus if not killed by the host's immune system replicates in the respiratory tract and damages host cells. in people who are immune compromised (for example pregnant individuals infants cancer patients asthma patients people with pulmonary disease and many others) the virus can cause viral pneumonia or stress the individual's system to make them more susceptible to bacterial infections especially bacterial pneumonia. both pneumonia types viral and bacterial can cause severe disease and sometimes death. antigenic shift and drift influenza type a viruses undergo two kinds of changes. one is a series of mutations that occurs over time and causes a gradual evolution of the virus. this is called antigenic \"drift. \" the other kind of change is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins. this is called antigenic \"shift. \" in this case a new subtype of the virus suddenly emerges. type a viruses undergo both kinds of changes; influenza type b viruses change only by the more gradual process of antigenic drift and therefore do not cause pandemics. a diagram that illustrates both antigenic shift and drift can be found at <link> and shows how both mechanisms can lead to antigenically diverse virus strains. the 2009 pandemic-causing h1n1 virus is a classic example of antigenic shift. the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has indicated that novel h1n1 swine flu has an rna genome that contains five rna strands derived from various swine flu strains two rna strands from bird flu strains and only one rna strand from human flu strains. they suggest mainly antigenic shifts over about 20 years have led to the development of novel h1n1 flu virus."

    "Answer": "cpk stands for creatine phosphokinase. it’s an enzyme found in high concentrations in muscles where it facilitates muscle contraction. cpk is also called creatine kinase or ck. doctors may check cpk when there’s concern for muscle damage or breakdown: in a rare condition called rhabdomyolysis extreme muscle breakdown floods the blood with cpk and other chemicals in muscle cells. some of these are toxic to the kidneys making the condition dangerous. doctors may repeatedly check cpk levels in people with suspected rhabdomyolysis to assess any potential risk to the kidneys. people taking cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins sometimes have increases in cpk levels as a side effect of the medication. the heart is made of muscle and during a heart attack cpk leaks out of the heart along with other enzymes. a doctor may check cpk repeatedly over time in someone she suspects may be having a heart attack. troponin another enzyme present in the heart is often relied on more for this purpose than is cpk. cpk may be slightly elevated in many people after exercise or due to unclear reasons."

    "Question": "how is income used to calculate subsidy eligibility in the health insurance exchanges?",
    "Answer": "the formula to find out if you qualify for a subsidy on the health insurance exchanges seems complicated but it is actually quite simple. let’s walk through it. the subsidy calculation is based on your income and the average cost of certain health plans on the exchange. subsidies are only available to those who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (fpl). in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. the amount of subsidy you receive depends upon where your income falls between the 100% and 400% fpl range. for example if your income is 100% fpl you are only responsible for the amount of monthly premiums that equals 2% of your income. anything above that dollar amount is considered your subsidy. below is the chart from 100-400% fpl of how much of your income you will have to pay towards your monthly premiums on the exchange. these percentages of income are not your subsidy; they are your contribution. the subsidy is calculated per individual or family based upon the dollar amount that goes over this contribution. income amount of income responsible for in premiums 100-133% fpl 2% of income 133-150% fpl 3 – 4% of income 150-200% fpl 4 – 6. 3% of income 200-250% fpl 6. 3 – 8. 05% of income 250-300% fpl 8. 05 – 9. 5% of income 300-400% fpl 9. 5% of income also beginning on january 1 2015 if your employer offers health insurance but your portion of the monthly premiums in your employer-based plan cost 9. 5% or more of your income you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange."

    "Answer": "that is the nasolacrimal duct that drains tears from your eyes into your nose. when you peel onions your eyes will water and your nose will run. when you cry your nose will run. this duct goes two ways so it is possible to have air come through when you blow your nose. this is innocent and there is really nothing you can do to correct this normal phenomena unless you want a surgeon to close this duct. then of course the tears will run down our cheek. not a good solution. though it's rare it is possible for air to come out through there. the reason why is because the tear ducts are actually connected to the top of your nasal cavity. normally when you cry some of your tears actually flow down into your nose - one of the reasons why our noses run sometimes when we cry. since it's all connected anyway you probably just have slightly larger passages between the two areas."

    "Question": "what happens to the body when a person gets tuberculosis?",
    "Answer": "when the inhaled tuberculosis bacteria enter the lungs they can multiply and cause a local lung infection (pneumonia). the local lymph nodes associated with the lungs may also become involved with the infection and usually become enlarged. the hilar lymph nodes (the lymph nodes adjacent to the heart in the central part of the chest) are often involved. in addition tb can spread to other parts of the body. the body's immune (defense) system however can fight off the infection and stop the bacteria from spreading. the immune system does so ultimately by forming scar tissue around the tb bacteria and isolating it from the rest of the body. tuberculosis that occurs after initial exposure to the bacteria is often referred to as primary tb. if the body is able to form scar tissue (fibrosis) around the tb bacteria then the infection is contained in an inactive state. such an individual typically has no symptoms and cannot spread tb to other people. the scar tissue and lymph nodes may eventually harden like stone due to the process of calcification of the scars (deposition of calcium from the bloodstream in the scar tissue). these scars often appear on x-rays and imaging studies like round marbles and are referred to as a granuloma. if these scars do not show any evidence of calcium on x-ray they can be difficult to distinguish from cancer. sometimes however the body's immune system becomes weakened and the tb bacteria break through the scar tissue and can cause active disease referred to as reactivation tuberculosis or secondary tb. for example the immune system can be weakened by old age the development of another infection or a cancer or certain medications such as cortisone anticancer drugs or medications used to treat arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. the breakthrough of bacteria can result in a recurrence of the pneumonia and a spread of tb to other locations in the body. the kidneys bone and lining of the brain and spinal cord (meninges) are the most common sites affected by the spread of tb beyond the lungs."

    "Question": "what are some alternative therapies used to treat hot flashes?",
    "Answer": "about 20% of menopausal women get no hot flashes; about 20% are totally wiped out by them-and the rest of us are in the middle. we have no idea why this happens – hormone levels are the same in the severe sufferers and the folks who get none. certain conditions make them worse. smokers go through menopause about 1-2 years earlier than non smokers and suffer worse hot flashes than non smokers when they do. obese women have more severe hot flashes than slender women. hot flashes for many women are worse in the perimenopausal years; and hot flashes do tend to get better over time. however even after 10 years since the last period about 15% of women still have significant hot flashes. what can we do on our own to make things better? a regular exercise regime avoiding known triggers including red wine hot coffee and spicy foods – these bother many women. sleeping in as cool a room as you can usually helps at night; and keep another nightgown next to the bed if you wake up soaking. layered dressing is good for the daytime. there is some data to suggest that soy foods tend to be helpful. there is some controversy about soy products in women with breast cancer; you may need to clear that with your oncologist. there is very little data on other food products being helpful. there is some data on the herbal supplement black cohosh. cohosh is not a plant estrogen (that is the concern about soy: soy is rich in isoflavones which many folks refer to as weak plant estrogens. ) there is very little data on other herbal products."

    "Answer": "i'm so sorry you're going through this. back pain isn't fun and it's nothing to fool around with. when a marine (or former marine) tell me he has barely controlled back pain this tells me he needs to see a doctor. many back conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing from a displaced disk to a cracked vertebra. the only way to find out for sure what's going on is to get a physical examination and some testing (like x-rays or mri) done. back problems rarely get better on their own so the sooner you get this treated the better. i wish you all the best with this!"

    "Answer": "no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it."

    "Question": "how is toxoplasmosis during pregnancy treated?",
    "Answer": "if you are not pregnant and have a healthy immune system you won't need treatment for toxoplasmosis. any symptoms that develop typically go away on their own. but if you become infected while pregnant you will need treatment to try to protect your growing baby ( fetus ). because the immune system of a fetus is not mature enough to fight off a toxoplasmosis infection antibiotics are needed to kill the parasite. infants who are treated before birth are more likely to be healthy after birth. newborns who are not diagnosed and treated until after birth have a higher risk of brain and eye damage before birth or during the first 2 years of life. if you are diagnosed with a new toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy you will be treated with an antibiotic that targets infection in the placenta. if further testing shows that your fetus is infected you will be given two antibiotics that are known to reduce the impact of toxoplasmosis on the fetus. 3 for more information see the medications section of this topic. sometimes fetal ultrasound testing early in a pregnancy shows severe or life-threatening fetal problems. in such cases parents may consider ending the pregnancy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "the birth control pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy so as long as you both do not ever (now or in the future) violate your monogamous agreement you can decide to give up condoms and withdrawal. if you both have had prior sexual partners and not had a prior std and are now testing negative you are probably good to go. remember that no birth control is 100% (unless it is abstinence and sterilization). the 98% or so effectiveness from birth control pills can be improved a bit by using condoms as well but that will be your mutual choice. condoms can leak so your still taking your chances. most contraceptive pills put a disclaimer on the package guaranteeing only 99% effectiveness. pulling out is not effective as a small amount of semen might still seep in even when you pull out. my opinion: your best bet is to have a vasectomy and/or a tubal ligation. when both persons' accepted the risk. if educated already on safe sex. it is a decision of the two to be one team & one family. as a like the three branches of government. that is an both consider path of the two co-founders of the relationship. since this is now equal society. maybe we can create a birth control pill for the male. the female has been elitely taken more risk. in the past present & futures. as friends & family. our health is an on going issue to happiness. subdue various cases of changes. in ones lives that effects another. it is the key to being one's self & growth through out life. non educated or being careless are the more targeted factors of the spread all that comes with territory of having sex. parenting & mentors that are response to lead are just by the handful. who can reach the understandings of this base. sensitive subject among all life itself."

    "Answer": "there are \"natural ways\" of contraception like the rhythm method or coitus interruptus (pulling out before ejaculation) but most people who practice these less-than-perfect methods end up being parents. non-vaginal sex like oral sex mutual masturbation etc. is effective but perhaps not enjoyable as good ol' fashioned intercourse. you can use a diaphragm or a cervical cap. basically you both need to see a good gynecologist or visit planned parenthood for a consultation. birth control pills when properly prescribed are safe. the do not have \"high risks of side effects\" like you believe. there are few natural ways of preventing pregnancy since getting pregnant is really the natural way. humans are designed to conceive; not to prevent pregnancy. hi try having a look on www. dodsonandross. com you may find some info on there or post6 to dr betty dodson she may have something up her sleeve to help you but without full vaginal intercourse its down to oral mutual masturbating or anal sex your find all the info you need for all 3 on dodson and ross site lots on info on the sex your find quite interesting lots to read. do hope this helps you and your man your find its a long and bumpy road marriage that is but getting sex right your there. good luck to you both. hi there! i'm using persona it is made by unilever and it's different from babycomp because it does not use temperatura (which may vary a lot during your cycle) but urine tests to check for your hormonal levels. it takes a bit for it to get to know you so it will ask you to restrain from sex (or use a barrier method) for more days during the first 1-3 months. then you will probably get \"red\" (no sex) days about 3-7 times a month."

    "Question": "should i see a doctor before starting antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea?",
    "Answer": "actually for self-treatment in the field we don't really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment. many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe -- there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations. so we urge people to get the medications they may need -- and some education on when and how to use them -- from their provider before traveling. then they can self-treat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers' diarrhea."

    "Answer": "masturbation is a choice. it is definitely not necessary. eating is necessary. drinking is necessary. paying taxes is necessary. masturbation is optional. masturbation is not a necessity and if a person does not want to engage in the practice there is no reason that he should; however if he opts not to masturbate and it is not due to reasons such as religious beliefs being too busy enjoys exerting willpower etc. he may want to consider consulting with a doctor in case he has a low libido and might want to take steps to address that issue. on a separate note all men should keep an eye on their penis health; using a top notch penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) can help. a good bet is a cream that includes l-arginine which can help with penis blood flow issues. hi o the joys of a j arthur one of the wrist spank the monkey bash the bishop yes these all mean to masturbate with the pleasure of ones own penis. its something we don't did to do but if your feeling horny and your wife g/f are not around then being men we just did it don't put it off don't try and hold back from it its not dirty and don't be ashamed but it will make you fell relaxed. its something you can do in the shower the bath in the car(but not why your driving or why taken a walk in the country. as men do we need it your read at some point that some men can go through there whole life and say never done that! but doing it is good for our prostate keeps our system ticking over till we do need it so yes in one way we do need to masturbate why our body's need it so for that just once or twice a week will not hurt you. but don't forget don't use a tight grip it needs to be feather light just like the feel of the vagina and use some oil just baby oil will do or some olive oil if your in the kitchen shower gel when in the shower gives that extra clean same in the bath or just a bar of soap it all helps. do hope this helps. good luck"

    "Question": "how many bathroom trips in a day are considered \"frequent urination\"? . 30 year old overweight woman concerned about diateties. no other noticeable symptoms",
    "Answer": "this is an excellent question and i'm glad you asked it. it's also kind of a hard question to answer. everyone's bathroom habits are different. usually when we talk about \"frequent urination \" we mean \"more frequently than is normal for you. \" but because type 2 diabetes specifically is a disease that can come on gradually you may not notice that your urinary frequency has increased. if you're urinating every hour that probably would generally be considered \"frequent. \" if your urine has a sort of sweet smell that's another telltale sign of potential diabetes. the only way to know for sure if you have type 2 diabetes is to get some lab work done. don't be afraid to know the truth. untreated diabetes can have long-term health consequences. it's better to find out early and seek early treatment than to go along in denial and damage your kidneys or lose your eyesight. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider. he or she can help you not only determine whether or not you have diabetes but also discuss ways you can take control of your overall health and well-being. wishing you all the best!"

    "Question": "can a doctor decide that if there is any blockage in blood vein by doing ecg? . one of my relative had a chest pain n hospitalized immediately. he has been monitored closely by a cardiac doctor and by doing an ecg the doctor concluded that he has a block in blood vein and need to be removed by doing angioplasty. but he never done angiogram!",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer the answer here isn't quite as straightforward as you might think so let me try to explain. it's true an ecg doesn't look inside the body the way an angiogram does. however an ecg does trace the heart's electrical conduction system. if an artery in the heart has become blocked and caused a portion of the heart muscle to die this can affect the electrical conduction system. and that damage in turn would be reflected on an ecg. that's probably why your relative's cardiologist is going directly to angioplasty. actually the physician likely will perform an angiogram first then do the angioplasty immediately afterwards. instead of having to undergo two procedures your relative will only go through one. that's healthier in many ways. it reduces infection risk and your relative will only have to recover one time instead of two. if your relative has any questions about why his or her cardiologist is choosing this particular treatment your relative should speak up. every patient has a right to know why a procedure is being performed what the expected outcome is and what the recovery will be like. communication is key in getting great medical treatment and sometimes that communication has to start with the patient. best wishes to you and your relative!"

    "Answer": "there is a difference between preventing weight gain and losing weight. research shows exercise of about an hour a day is protective for weight gain during midlife. also resistance training is key to help maintain muscle mass because gradual muscle loss is part of the reason women gain weight with age. i guess the question is is your weight in a healthy range now? if it is it might not be realistic to expect it to stay the same throughout this time or lose it to be at a weight you used to be. if your numbers are good (cholesterol etc. ) and your blood pressure is normal overly focusing on weight may not be helpful to your health or quality of life. but if you feel the extra weight isn't good for you or you have risk factors than i highly suggest you see a registered dietitian. you can find one in your area at eatright. org also see weight loss menopause and exercise tips"

    "Question": "my cancer is in remission. how do i deal with the fear of reoccurrence?",
    "Answer": "one of the most difficult challenges in coping with cancer is dealing with the fears of recurrence. in the jargon of cancer we talk of “remission ” which can be partial (cancer goes partly away) or complete (no evidence of cancer can be found). examples of partial remission include stage iv cancers (metastatic to different regions of the body) that reduce in size as detected by tests such as cat pet or bone scans; complete remission may be obtained at surgery (for early stages of breast colon prostate lung etc. ) which is often followed by some type of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy to prevent a cancer relapse or recurrence. so whether a person is living with an active cancer or has been told they are “cancer- free ” the possibility of the cancer returning or reactivating is very real. it takes work to deal with the fears of recurrence. the first step in doing so is to acknowledge the reality of the situation — not to bury it mentally and ignore it. but it is not helpful to focus on it again and again; it is important to “live for today ” as i have recently blogged about. there are many other helpful coping strategies and helpful individuals experienced in this field. finally i would encourage all cancer patients and their loved ones to attend a support group led by an experienced professional such as an oncology social worker or family therapist. rather than inciting more fear bonding with other survivors can be a great comfort. individual counseling should also be sought out especially for those who have private concerns that they would not like to share with others. most cancer centers have counselors available free of charge; there are also other organizations that have support groups and counseling such as cancercare or gilda’s club. i have had cancer twice in 5 years and i now in remission with my second cancer. how i deal with it is to take one day at a time and hope for the best. try to do exercising everyday and try to eat healthy and hopefully that will help. it's really hard. you will have your good days and bad days. try to keep busy. another thing is to look on the bright side such as your family friends. they're there for you and if that don't help try to seek some help through the cancercare. gov. they have been good for me. there is a lot of information etc that is very helpfull. you might even want to join a group session."

    "Answer": "hi! as a former plastic surgery nurse i feel uniquely qualified to answer your question. <positive_smiley> it's not uncommon for a woman (especially one like yourself who considers herself a \"natural\" type person) to feel uncomfortable physically and psychologically with her enhanced breasts in the time period immediately following the surgery. in my experience this discomfort goes away pretty quickly as you get used to the new breasts. when i was a plastic surgery nurse the surgeon i worked for always advised women to wait at least 3 months before making a decision about the size or removal of implants. at the three-month mark virtually all of the swelling has gone away and you've had time to adjust to your new look. i can tell you in my experience none of our clients who felt as you do opted to have their implants removed once they got used to them. i hope this helps ease your mind. you're still recovering so be kind to yourself and give both your body and your emotions time to cope with this surgery. best wishes to you! hi so without seeing them just try living with them for a while let your body readjust to them must seem odd having them back to wear they were before having children time my dear women time. good luck i am a breast specialist in nc and can totally understand how you are feeling. you should wait at least 3-4 months before you make any decisions. at this point your breasts will look and feel very unnatural and most patients don't like the early results. as your tissues accomodate the implant and the chest muscles relax they will start to look and feel much better. give it some time and discuss with your plastic surgeon. for more information see: <link>"

    "Answer": "hi this is the answer from plan b site that i think suits your situation. yes. emergency contraceptive pills (also called \"morning after pills\" or \"day after pills\") only protect against pregnancy when you take them after sex. that means you can still get pregnant if you take emergency contraception and then have sex again without using another kind of contraception or your birth control fails. if you still don’t want to get pregnant you will need to take emergency contraceptive pills again. (although emergency contraceptive pills would probably still protect you if you had sex immediately after taking them there is no research to show how long they would work. ) some women find they need emergency contraception more than once because they haven’t found a regular type of birth control that fits their health and lifestyle needs. to find out more about which contraceptives might work best for you click here. and be sure to talk to your health care provider if you are having any problems with your birth control. hope this helps. good luck"

    "Answer": "try a different brand of condom. some are thicker and less sensitive than others. have a condom on during foreplay and get used to it. if you are losing your erection just relax and allow your partner to help you out. it will most likely come back. they always do. as you may know there is nothing physically wrong with you or your condom use. this is just psychological. with a caring and understanding partner your sexual exploits can last longer and actually be more interesting by repeatedly getting and losing an erection. besides there are many more ways to please your partner than with your penis. don't stop using he condom (no matter what your confused brain is trying to tell you). safe sexual practices are absolutely essential. do not compromise."

    "Answer": "knee and hip replacements consisting of metal-on-metal may cause a condition called metallosis. this side effect happens when rubbing of the metal implanted surfaces results in chromium and cobalt particles accumulating in the blood stream to toxic levels (some cobalt & chromium is normally found in the blood stream to carry-out routine cellular actions). the recommended treatment for metallosis is a complete surgical revision (removing the implant and installing a new implant) of the knee or hip."

    "Answer": "you're smart to think about potential drug interactions. whenever you have questions about prescription medications you can check with a pharmacist. pharmacists represent a great resource for all types of drug-related questions including potential interactions. in fact it's a good idea to get all of your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. that way the pharmacist is more likely to catch potential drug interactions before you even receive the pills. i'm not a pharmacist myself but i don't believe there's any interaction between minocycline and terbinafine oral. one is an antibiotic and the other an antifungal. generally i believe these two drug classes \"play nice\" together. however you should ask your healthcare provider. if your provider knew you were taking minocycline he or she would not prescribe terbinafine unless it was safe to do so. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what are the best exercises for building and maintaining bone density?",
    "Answer": "according to the national osteoporosis foundation the best exercises for building and maintaining bone density are: weight-bearing exercise such as walking that makes you work against gravity while staying upright. muscle-strengthening exercise such as weight lifting that makes you work against gravity in a standing sitting or prone position. nonimpact activities such as balance functional and posture exercises also may benefit people with osteoporosis. although these exercises don't build or maintain bone density they may increase muscle strength and decrease the risk of falls and fractures."

    "Question": "how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.",
    "Answer": "hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically \"osteoarthritis\" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the \"wear and tear\" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define \"arthritis\" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed. i am type 2 diabetic so that could have something to do with it. get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life."

    "Question": "why is it necessary to hold the labia open for clean catch midstream collection?",
    "Answer": "the objective of a \" clean catch \" is for the urine not to pick up any bacteria from outside the body. when the urine passes from the body through the urethral meatus (the external opening to the urethra which is located just above the vagina) the stream could contact the labia and pick up bacteria from them. to perform a clean catch you separate the labia with your fingers then wipe down and away with the provided antimicrobial wipes to cleanse the area. usually you wipe more than once. this removes all external bacteria from the path of the urine. next you start the urine stream then move the cup into the stream for a clean catch. this way the urine washes away if you will any external bacteria from the urethral meatus. thus the urine specimen contains only cells and possible bacteria from within the bladder and urinary tract itself. this enables the health care provider to diagnose abnormal bacteria or a urinary tract infection (bladder infection). i hope that explains things for you!"

    "Question": "it is possible for a pinched nerve in the shoulder to have symptoms similar to a heart attack? . i went to the er with what i thought was a heart attack (chest pain and numbness in the left arm). after two days of tests i was told by a cardiologist and a neuologist that i had a pinched nerve in my neck. i cannot find any relationship for the two. is this diagnosis correct? i have since switched cardiologist. i go every six months for a check up and annually for a nuclear stress test. so far all is good.",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer i'm glad to hear all is good and i hope i can help set your mind at ease. a pinched nerve in the neck can send pain radiating down the shoulder and arm -- and even into the chest area which could indeed feel like the symptoms of a heart attack. presumably you received an x-ray or mri scan of your neck. this is usually how a pinched nerve in the neck is diagnosed. pinched nerves in the neck are often caused by compression of a disk in the spinal column of the neck. this compression puts pressure on the nerve which in turn causes the pain. you're right that there's no relationship between a pinched nerve in the neck and a heart problem. it's just that the pinched nerve caused you to have pain that was similar to what a person feels when they have a heart attack. hope this helps! i had a similar case but mine was from the t-11. the nerve bundle that comes from the t-11 wraps around the chest and will give pain signs of a heart attack. i had to gone to many dr's and finally a student sitting in (they had just done the study of the t-11 told the dr what he thought it was). i ended up having a bone spur after they cut it out i was fine. i would think this is where the problem was and not the neck. the t-11 is in the upper mid back just below the shoulder blades. on a side note they found an aortic aneurysm that needed to be fixed said i had about 2 years or less."

    "Question": "can you get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery?",
    "Answer": "assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery."

    "Answer": "the price of the sunglasses does not guarantee the amount of uv protection. more importantly if you are wearing sunglasses that are darkly tinted yet do not offer much uv protection the back of your eyes will be exposed to more uv light not less. this is because the tinted lenses will encourage your pupils to dilate (enlarge) which will then allow more uv light to reach the back of your eye. although this uv exposure may not take its toll immediately increased uv exposure has clearly been linked to many forms of eye disease that may not show up for decades. age-related macular degeneration and cataracts are just two forms of delayed eye disease that good (not necessarily expensive) eyeglasses can help prevent."

    "Answer": "generally speaking just looking at the overall amount of caffeine is the first place i tell people to go. you shouldn’t be ingesting more than about 250 milligrams of caffeine in any particular day according to the national sleep foundation. and i like to use that as kind of a guide. and so if you’re ingesting more than that i would say try to slow back and cut back to that amount and see if it helps your sleep. but a lot of time people tell me that they have racing thoughts. if they have caffeine induced insomnia people tell me that they have muscle tension and people tell me that they have sort of tingly jitters. 250 milligrams of caffeine is approximately what? well it depends. that could be almost a six pack of soda because soda doesn’t have as much caffeine as people think. it’s got somewhere between 40 and 60 milligrams of caffeine unless of course you’re talking about the high caffeinated sodas like the red bulls. wow so it’s not as easy as it looks. and then brewed coffee turns out to have more caffeine in it than cappuccino or lattes and things of that nature. so you can actually go and look and try to understand exactly how much caffeine is in each different substance."

    "Answer": "according to the manufacturer's information vaginal contraceptive film (vcf) is reputed to be 94% effective. this is comparable to the diaphragm's effectiveness with normal use (e. g. occasional errors). i have personally not used the vcf but i have heard that it does not drip like other spermicides. i have used both the diaphragm and the today sponge (90% effective according to its manufacturer). like other non-hormonal methods they rely on spermicide for effectiveness. the sponge has 1 gram of nonoxyol 9 (much more than the amount used in a diaphragm jelly spermicide). consequently the sponge can be used for more than one ejaculation (unlike a diaphragm where one is supposed to add more spermicide using a plunger like those designed for vaginal yeast cream). personal opinion? the sponge was easier than the diaphragm for camping and it absorbed all the ejaculate so no mess. sponge was more expensive. diaphragm required planning and even i occasionally did not follow instructions (e. g. did not use more spermicide). diaphragm can be drippy after removal. bottom line consider trying both the vcf and the sponge. see how they work for you. if you are accustomed to the effectiveness rate of hormonal forms of birth control you could consider using condoms as an additional protection. one other non-hormonal form which has the highest effectiveness rate is the copper t or paragard iud."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer janumet a medication used in type 2 diabetes causes weight loss. janumet is a combination medication of metformin and sitagliptin. metformin (glucophage) and sitagliptin (januvia) can each be used alone for the treatment of diabetes. janumet is indicated when diet and exercise fail to adequately control diabetes and both metformin and sitagliptin are appropriate. metformin definitely causes weight loss and sitagliptin usually results in weight loss or is weight neutral. a 24-week study that looked at weight loss with janumet found that the amount of weight lost was about the same for patients on metformin alone. during this 24-week study patients lost between 1. 3 to 2. 9 lbs. since weight loss is an important part of the treatment plan for most type 2 diabetics it is very helpful to use a medication that helps you go in the right direction. don’t forget that diet and exercise are still the key ingredients to weight loss. talk with your provider about how you can achieve your weight loss goals and if a medication like janumet is right for you."

    "Answer": "researchers have yet to pinpoint the exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) but brain abnormalities genetic (family) influences and environmental factors are being studied. brain scans of people with ocd have shown that they have different patterns of brain activity than people without ocd and that abnormal functioning of circuitry within a certain part of the brain (striatum) may cause the disorder. abnormalities in other parts of the brain and an imbalance of brain chemicals especially serotonin may also contribute to ocd. 1 some experts believe that a problem related to infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever can suddenly bring on the disorder or make its symptoms worse in some children. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "can you get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery?",
    "Answer": "assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery. yes i've done it"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information! if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that's probably accurate. a cyst is a pocket of tissue that's filled with some type of fluid. the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst. some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus. it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news. skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you've described. the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re-evaluate this. it's possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed. only your health care provider can say for sure. cysts are an annoyance but luckily they're not a serious disease. good luck to you as you cope with this!"

(see reference 3) have you had your testosterone levels checked? do you frequently drink wine or other alcohol? you seem very well educated about diet but many people forget that alcohol is a big contributer to belly fat. it is tougher to lose weight as you age but with the parameters you've described i think your lack of weight loss may be for one or more of these reasons. hope this helps janet reference1: <link> reference 2: <link> reference 3:<link> reference 4: /<link> exrx. net <link>"

    "Answer": "it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma -- a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic."

    "Answer": "yes you can get pregnant. that is why the implanon has an expiration date. the point where the hormone has depleted. this may be why your period is not normal. use a secondary form of birth control (like a condom) or you will be just taking chances."

    "Answer": "masturbation is not harmful and will not affect your ability to achieve or maintain an erection during sex. if you are having these issues associate with sexual activity -- your first sexual activity -- this could just be \"stage fright\" or performance anxiety. while there can be organic reason why a person could not achieve an erection the fact that you are not having a problem with masturbation proves that the blood supply to your penis is adequate the nerves are working and all systems are \"go\". if (and when) you find a caring partner try to relax and allow nature to take its course when it comes to sexual activity. if you are still having problems you may need to see a counselor to help you through this anxiety-provoking event. many fears run through a man's mind when first-having sex: will i be able to perform? will i please my partner? will something happen that will embarrass me? will i get an std? many things. let sex \"happen\". don't be anyone but yourself."

    "Answer": "as far as when the cancer is gone it may take 18-24 months for the radiation to clear the cancer from your prostate gland. the psa should go down to a very low number. the best results are when the psa goes to less than 0. 2ng/ml. certainly if the psa does not fall to below 0. 5ng/ml by 2 years this may mean the brachytherapy did not work completely. if your psa does not drop to these low levels you may need another prostate biopsy but this should not generally be done until after 18-24 months. there is also something called \"psa bounce\" where the psa can temporarily bump up after brachytherapy. this is important because if this happens in the first 2 years you should not worry about cancer returning right away and wait out the psa bounce and usually it falls back down. in general. brachytherapy is a good choice for men in their 70's. ."

    "Question": "could my previous method of birth control affect my fertility?",
    "Answer": "we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail; now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well. could there be long-term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving? let's review them briefly and put your mind at ease. 1. combined hormonal methods (e. g. birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring). these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility. we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle (whatever that means for you) within 3 months of stopping all of these methods. 2. progesterone only methods (the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant). we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months. the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due (since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot). again no long term impact on fertility 3. intrauterine device (iud). the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility (which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available). although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4. diaphragms condoms and spermicides. these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them. condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well. so where are the concerns regarding fertility? some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility. for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth. ."

    "Answer": "if you always experience a lack of periods (amenorrhea) when your weight drops below a certain point then that is a sign that your lower weight is not enough to sustain normal periods. while estrogen often decreases when body fat and weight dips too low that may not always be the case. the female body needs a certain percentage of body fat to allow the hormones to work properly. this mixed with strenuous exercise and perhaps a diet lacking in key nutrients and calories is enough to keep your body from having periods. my suggestion to you is to see a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition. they can look at your diet activity level and weight and provide recommendations to stay healthy which includes regular periods. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. good luck and take care of yourself!"

    "Answer": "any skin lesion in or near the genital area should be evaluated. a description alone does not rule out or accurately diagnose genital herpes but based on what you have posted it seems less likely. it may be folliculitis -- an infection of a hair follicle but without the ability to exam a patient this is only a guess. if you are concerned it is going to take an examination and perhaps a diagnostic test (like a culture) to provide you with the assurance that you deserve."

    "Answer": "you may notice some hair loss but most often only in the treated area. if you do have hair loss it will usually occur suddenly and come out in clumps. in most cases the hair will grow back after therapy stops but it may be thinner or have a different texture. one way to minimize hair loss is to cut your hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. if the hair loss occurs on top of your head be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. if you decide to purchase a wig ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense."

    "Answer": "teething is a process and getting that first tooth can take longer in some children. the lack of drooling is really not clinically significant but if he is having loose stools he could be a bit dehydrated. a dry mouth lack of tears and less wet diapers would indicate that he needs more fluids. if he does have a mild \"stomach bug\" it doesn't appear that it would be too bad since he is acting well. just treat any discomfort if you notice it and make sure the gets plenty of fluids. otherwise. i suspect he will be fine. you can check with the few symptoms listed below to know more about your baby's teething. drooling. irritability. a tooth visible below the gum. swollen bulging gums. trying to bite chew and suck on everything she can get her hands on. rubbing her face. difficulty sleeping. turning away food. if the problem continues then consult a good pediatric for you baby's oral health."

    "Answer": "baby : your baby is still very small only about 0. 014 inches to 0. 04 inches in length. the embryo probably in about its second week of development has multiplied to about 150 cells. your baby is being nourished by secretions from the uterine lining. layers of cells already are specialized according to functions. the outer layer will become the nervous system skin and hair; the inner layer will be the breathing and digestive organs; and the middle layer will become the skeleton bones cartilage muscles circulatory system kidneys and sex organs. mom-to-be : you're probably expecting your period this week and if it doesn't occur it might be one of the first signs that you're pregnant. you may also notice light spotting as the embryo implants itself in your uterus. you might not feel any different yet but the amniotic cavity which will be filled with fluid and the placenta which will bring oxygen and nutrients to nourish your baby are forming in your uterus. tip for the week : try to eat healthfully which means choosing a variety of foods from the recommended food groups and drinking at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. but you don't really need to \"eat for two. \" you need only an extra 300 calories per day during pregnancy. and don't worry if your food intake drops a little in the beginning because of morning sickness. if you've been eating right already your baby will get what it needs."

    "Answer": "well those lab results are a little high. keyword: little. they're not off the charts by any means. the normal reference range for bun (blood-urea-nitrogen) is 7-20 mg/dl and the range for serum (blood) creatinine for a male is 0. 7 - 1. 4 mg/dl. so you can see yours are higher than normal but only your health care provider can interpret these results relative to your medical history. that's the key point here. these results may be not good for one person but ok for another. keep in mind dehydration can cause bun to rise so it's possible that's the only thing that is going on here. both bun and creatinine measure kidney function by the way. your health care provider should have more information for you at your follow-up appointment. if your situation were dire your provider would have called you immediately with instructions on what to do. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "your question is an important one for women with epilepsy who wish to have a family. there is little scientific information on this subject and most of what we know if based on clinical experience of doctors taking care of women with epilepsy. the bottom line is that most physicians with expertise in managing epilepsy encourage their patients to breastfeed even if they are taking anti-seizure medicine. the baby has developed for nine months in the presence of the anti-seizure medicine and as such for the baby to continue to be exposed to it after delivery usually does not create problems. i am unaware of any descriptions of problems with breastfeeding while on trileptal (oxcarbazepine). if blood levels are done in mom and her baby while breastfeeding the baby's level will be around half of the mother's. so the baby is definitely getting some of the drug but it usually does not create problems as best we [can] tell. so if breastfeeding is important to you (as it is for most women) most experts in the field would encourage you to breastfeed."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal \"red blotch\". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated."

    "Answer": "sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas."

    "Answer": "i think this is a great question. one of the things we learned after hurricane katrina is that a lot of people didn't have emergency kits available at home. some things i would definitely recommend include a bottle of hydrogen peroxide; to help clean out any type of wounds. maybe a triple antibiotic ointment to apply on the wounds after you have actually treated it band aids gauze pads rolled gauze so you can keep the gauze pad in place a flashlight extra batteries a weather radio. some type of fever reducer like tylenol or acetaminophen. maybe a motrin type of product as well. some imodium or pepto-bismol is another item that you may want to include in there along with some plastic latex gloves just in case something happens and you need to protect yourself. those are some of the common items that are found in the emergency kits that are available on the stores today. i would definitely recommend checking the expiration dates. once a year you should always go through that emergency kit as well as your medicine cabinet and check the expiration dates; if anything has expired you want to make sure that you dispose of it properly. in this case we want to make sure that people use the correct method. you want to get a ziploc bag and you want to take the medications and put it into the ziploc bag. you want to take a little bit of water and you want to help it dissolve or you can crush it with like a pot or a hammer. then you want to take something that will make it not very appealing like kitty litter or coffee grinds. put that into the ziploc bag seal it up and put it in the trash. that's the best way. we don't want people to flush medications anymore this is the preferred way now to dispose of medications. but that's a good rule of thumb each year to do."

    "Answer": "it’s uncommon (though not unheard of) for shingles to affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva. it’s very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur. shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood. most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox. after we recover from chickenpox varicella doesn’t disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years. later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles. (varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from hsv-1 and hsv-2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals. ) varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina. ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to hsv-1 or hsv-2 (herpes infections). taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're having trouble with your liver but glad you're seeking a diagnosis. colonoscopy is not used to look at the liver. colonoscopy is a procedure in which a flexible camera is inserted into the rectum and moved upward through the colon (large intestine or bowel). this procedure allows the doctor to literally look at the lining of your large intestine and diagnose lesions polyps or tumors. for liver troubles doctors often perform a similar procedure called an endoscopy (or \"advanced endoscopy\"). this procedure involves putting you to sleep under anesthesia and then inserting a small camera into your esophagus. this scope can be maneuvered to the liver where the doctor again can visually detect lesions or other abnormalities. he or she even can perform small surgeries this way. i would suggest you talk to your doctor again about exactly why he or she has ordered a colonoscopy exam for you. perhaps the reason is unrelated to the liver trouble. regardless you deserve to understand precisely why you are being asked to undergo a minimally invasive procedure. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking. according to the experts it is never too late to start an exercise program. they have worked with people in nursing homes who were unable to walk and got them walking again! get cleared by your doctor first to make sure you do not have any underlying health problems. start gradually. just walking at first and then you can join a gym and work with a trainer for a while. you will be surprise with the results. it is never too late to start exercising. it is important that you get a professional trainer to guide you in exercising. you can start with something like yoga which will not be too stressful along with brisk walking. once your body adjusts to this routine you can hit the gym for light weights too."

    "Question": "i'm sure i have strep throat i'm allergic to penicillins and i think i'm getting better. do i really need meds? . on tuesday afternoon i had a tickle in my throat. w/in 3 hours i had a severe sore throat a fever no energy and swollen nodes the next day. i had white patches on my tonsils but today there is only 1 tiny one left. i haven't had a fever for a day and half i have more energy and feel a little better. do i really need antibiotics (i'm allergic to penicillin anyway) if it seems like i'm fighting it off? i know there can be complications but they're rare and i don't think i'm an \"at risk\" person.",
    "Answer": "waiting a few days makes sense. a few extra days of employing home remedies should not increase your chances of a complication occurring. i suggest drinking plenty of fluids frequent gargling use throat lozenges to soothe a sore throat sleep with a humidifier and take otc analgesics for discomfort. here are a few additional points: - eventually i recommend that you talk w/your physician about the allergy to penicillin. many folks mistakenly think that they are allergic to penicillin when in actually they were never allergic to this agent or the allergy has worn off. i remember reading that only 20% of individuals with a verified penicillin allergy continued to have a negative reaction after the passage of 10 years from the last dosage taken; - years ago doctors would culture the throat & would have to wait days for sensitivity results in determining if a patient had strep throat and the appropriate antibiotic that would be needed. today in the physician's office a patient can know the results through a swab of the throat and a 10 minute wait period. it may be a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor or medical clinic. that way your throat can be viewed by a medical professional a diagnostic determination probably made on the spot and you can discuss the possibly that you may not be allergic to penicillin. feel better soon."

    "Question": "what causes lupus systemic lupus erythematosus?",
    "Answer": "lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues as though they were foreign substances. lupus is not contagious. no one knows exactly what causes the body to attack its own tissues. a person may be born with a certain genetic makeup that affects how the immune system functions or makes him or her at risk for lupus. a combination of factors can trigger the autoimmune process some of which may affect one person but not another. 1 exposure to ultraviolet light usually from sunlight is known to trigger the disease process and symptom flares. hormonal factors are linked to autoimmune disease though the link is poorly understood. some research shows an increased risk of lupus with higher levels of estrogen. but a separate study did not find evidence that the hormones estrogen or prolactin taken for hormone replacement therapy or birth control or taken previously for fertility treatments increased the risk of lupus. 2 another study showed that women with stable lupus had no increased risk of symptom flares from taking birth control pills. 3 smoking may increase the risk of getting lupus and may make the disease more severe. some medications are suspected triggers of lupus and symptom flares. some infections are suspected triggers. some people who have cytomegalovirus (cmv) parvovirus (such as fifth disease ) and hepatitis c infections eventually develop lupus. the epstein-barr virus has been linked to lupus in children. chemical exposure has been known to trigger lupus. suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica dust. hair dyes and straighteners linked to lupus in the past are no longer considered to be lupus triggers. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what is the normal gallbladder ejection fraction range? . i have been told mine is low following a hida scan but i have no gallstones.",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer the normal gallbladder ejection fraction ranges from 35% to 75%. if you're having pain that suggests gallstones but no stones are present this is called acalculous biliary pain (abp). \"acalculous\" simply means \"no stones \" and \"biliary\" means related to bile bile ducts and systems. gallbladder ejection fraction testing is one measure used to diagnose abp. if you suffer from abp you have at least a couple of options. because biliary pain usually is intermittent and often seems to come on after eating fatty foods you can try avoiding fatty foods to see if this helps the pain go away. another option is removal of the gallbladder ( cholecystectomy ) but this is somewhat controversial. some tests show people with abp benefit from cholecystectomy but the trouble is there aren't really enough tests to reach a definitive conclusion about that. talk things over with your health care provider to see what he or she recommends and go from there. i hope you feel better!"

    "Question": "does gargling with vodka kill germs in your throat? . at the onset of a sore throat i've been gargling with warm salt water these past 30+ years. but i just heard from a few friends that they gargle with vodka and that vodka kills the infections.",
    "Answer": "in a laboratory petri dish i am sure that the alcohol in the vodka would kill some or all of the bacteria but the throat is not a petri dish. there are many parts of the throat that vodka would not even touch. these areas would rapidly re-contaminate the non-gargled areas so any partial benefit that you might achieve would be mitigated. most sore throats are viral infections that only last about a week. in adults most will improve on day three or four if you do nothing at all. i would much prefer that you gargle with saline (a weak salt water solution) than to take a chance at aspirating vodka into your lungs. this can happen and it would not be pleasant. when you take health advice from your friends it can either be good advice or bad. in this case the advise was not wise. i would not recommend that you gargle with vodka."

    "Answer": "the pain of biting himself is just an odd form of stimuli common when kids are under some personal stress. change his bedtime rituals to include more time reading to him telling bedtime stories talking about his day (things that may be troubling him) rubbing/scratching his back or hugging him. consider allowing him to listen to soft music or nature sounds so he can relax and have more pleasant monster-free dreams. that back scratch alone should feel much better than biting himself. he may fall asleep as you rub his back. feeling his stress melt away. help him tell his brain that biting his arm is not something he should be doing and appropriately reward him for the progress he will make in stopping this habit. make bedtime a special time. you may not have many more years to be able to do these bedtime rituals."

    "Answer": "you really should not have sex after pregnancy until your health care provider clears you to do so. there are a number of reasons why. first of all having sex within a few weeks of a vaginal delivery could cause you to get a vaginal infection. everything \"down there\" needs time to heal. this is especially true if you had an episiotomy or perineal tear. if you had a c-section your incision is still healing at 5 weeks. you need to let your body have time to heal and recover. second unless you want to get pregnant again right away you need to be on some form of birth control. contrary to popular belief breastfeeding does not protect you against getting pregnant. if you're breastfeeding you can't take estrogen-containing birth control pills so you'll want to discuss birth control options with your health care provider to find one that's right for you. my best suggestion is to talk to your provider at your next visit to find out if it's ok for you to have sex and what type of birth control (if desired) is best for you. wishing you all the best!"

    "Answer": "any medication including thyroid medications can cause an allergic reaction such as hives. the incidence of hives with thyroid medication though is very low. however there is a known association between hives and thyroid antibodies. about a quarter of patients with long term hives (chronic urticaria) have antibodies to thyroid tissue and many of these patients are found to have low thyroid levels. the patients who had the worst hives were also the ones more likely to have antibodies to thyroid tissue. hives patients can also have antibodies to other immune mediated diseases such as lupus. unfortunately treating the thyroid condition does not eliminate the hives."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer if a rash forms on your skin where you have been exposed to it you should see a doctor to have it checked out. the skin rash and itching that some people get from contact with poison ivy is an allergy. so yes if you get a poison ivy rash that means you are allergic to it. some people can come in contact with poison ivy and not get a rash. that's because they're not allergic to poison ivy. but remember as with any allergy you can become allergic at any time. just because you've never had poison ivy doesn't mean that you won't get the itchy rash that comes along with it next time you're exposed. so it's always best to avoid it whenever possible. i would not try rubbing kerosene on my skin knowing how flamable it can be. use white kerosene with a cloth 2-3 daily and stay away from open flames. used it in the 1970's and worked the best. unothadox but works."

    "Answer": "you've removed a lot of body weight. sometimes it's hard to understand when to stop. you could sit down with your medical team and nutritionist and come to an agreement based on your body composition. clearly with a bmi of 22 (and hopefully a body fat around 25% or less) you could sustain this success for the long term. if that's hard to accept then you need to step back and ask yourself \"what was i expecting from this weight reduction? \" so much of this is about expectations. did you expect relationships to improve a new job offer or life to become blissful somehow? what is your body image? how do you view your body? do you have a good sense of self worth and self esteem? are you hoping to feel better about yourself by continuing to drop weight? why hasn't 100 pounds been sufficient to achieve that goal? i would highly recommend that you sit down with a counselor/nutritionist who can help guide you as you think this through. some people get so tied up in the cool feelings you get when you see that scale change that when they finally arrive they miss that sense of accomplishment. it's time to closely examine these feelings"

    "Question": "what does celiac disease do to the small intestine?",
    "Answer": "the small intestine has an inner lining of cells that form finger-like projections called villi. the villi are important because they increase the number of cells and surface area available for the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. in celiac disease inflammation destroys the villi causing the inner lining of the small intestine to become flattened. this loss of villi reduces the cells and surface area available for absorption of nutrients. the impaired absorption of nutrients is referred to as malabsorption. the malabsorption of nutrients leads to nutrient deficiencies referred to as malnutrition. the length (amount) of the small intestine affected by the loss of villi varies from patient to patient and the length that is involved determines the severity of signs and symptoms. thus patients whose entire small intestine is affected by a loss of villi have more severe signs and symptoms of malabsorption than patients who have only part of the small intestine affected. when only part of the small intestine is affected it usually is the upper small intestine (the duodenum and jejunum) that is more affected than the lower small intestine (the ileum)."

    "Question": "lost 50lbs since 4/12 injured my back and had surgery in 9/12 and probably again in 12/12. how do i keep the weight off? . started nutrisystem 4/12. . had my gallbladder removed 6/12. . quit smoking on 7/12. . 9/12 i got a shooting pain down my legs and soon after went numb between my legs. i had emergency surgery and am still in a lot of pain. might need a spinal fusion but insurance is fighting it. . how can i continue to lose weight when i am unable to exercise. i tried to do all of the right things to get healthy and am having no luck. any suggestions? . thanks . carrie",
    "Answer": "first off congratulations on your weight loss! i think you have a couple of choices right now. you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery. in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity. it's best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program. i don't know how much weight you have to lose the calories you've been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration. i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism. you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do. i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight. you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success. and just because you are not losing weight now doesn't mean you won't be able to in the future. good luck! carrie i had spinal fusion surgery 1/2000 (l4 l5 s1). regrettably so. i just cringed when i read your post. i have been living in constant agony worse than prior to surgery. i have 6 screws and 2 rods. i was told last week that the hardware has weakened. so i continue the blocks which are painful especially when the medicine goes down the nerve of my leg. severe pain there too. if that fails i may have to do surgery again which i won't. weight gain up the ying yang and exercising is difficult. i wish you the very best if you had it done. if you haven't really think about it."

    "Answer": "it takes many years before children develop the fine motor coordination they need to do a good tooth brushing job. some dentists advise that parents brush their children's teeth until the child can neatly write his or her own name. other dentists suggest parents use their own judgment but to consider between ages 6 and 8 as the time for kids to take on the job of keeping their teeth clean and healthy. general rule: a smear or pea sized drop of fluoridated toothpaste can be used when the child can spit effectively."

    "Answer": "unfortunately you're among a group of people for whom the law may not be of much help. at the income level you mention you wouldn't be eligible for a subsidy. even if your income did qualify you the fact that your wife's employer offers you insurance -- even if you find it unaffordable -- means you wouldn't qualify due to a certain provision of the law. the one positive here is that because of the law you're guaranteed an insurance policy. i would suggest you work with an insurance agent who can help you find a health plan that may be affordable to you. you can search your options online at ehealthinsurance. com. you can also call the 800 number on the website to work with a licensed insurance agent. an agent in your area can also be found at the national association of health underwriters: nahu. org."

    "Question": "took a dose of 50mcg levothyroxine can this cause harm? . should i be concerned since it is a natural hormone produced? effects if any it may cause?",
    "Answer": "the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of \"natural supplement\" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single 50mcg dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information."

    "Question": "do people with diabetes have an increased chance of developing heart disease?",
    "Answer": "heart disease is common in people with diabetes. data from the national diabetes fact sheet show that in 2004 heart disease was noted on 68% of diabetes-related death certificates in people 65 and older. stroke was noted on 16% of the diabetes-related death certificates in people 65 and older. in general the risks of heart disease death and stroke is 2-4 times higher in people with diabetes. while all people with diabetes have an increased chance of developing heart disease the condition is more common in those with type 2 diabetes. the framingham study was one of the first pieces of evidence to show that people with diabetes are more vulnerable to heart disease than those people who did not have diabetes. the framingham study looked at generations of people including those with diabetes to try to determine the health risk factors for developing heart disease. it showed that multiple health factors -- including diabetes -- could increase the possibility of developing heart disease. aside from diabetes other health problems associated with heart disease include high blood pressure smoking high cholesterol levels and a family history of early heart disease. the more health risks factors a person has for heart disease the higher the chances that they will develop heart disease and even die from it. just like anyone else people with diabetes have an increased risk of dying from heart disease if they have more health risk factors. however the probability of dying from heart disease is dramatically higher in a person with diabetes. so while a person with one health risk factor such as high blood pressure may have a certain chance of dying from heart disease a person with diabetes has double or even quadruple the risk of dying. for example one medical study found that people with diabetes who had no other health risk factors for heart disease were 5 times more likely to die of heart disease than those without. another medical study showed that people with diabetes no matter the number of other heart disease risk factors were as likely to have a heart attack as someone without diabetes who has already had a heart attack. heart disease experts recommend that all people with diabetes have their heart disease risk factors treated as aggressively as people who have already had heart attacks."

    "Question": "i have been on ortho tri-cyclen lo for nearly a year. my period started a week early this month. what could this mean?",
    "Answer": "ortho tri-cyclen lo contains a low amount of estrogen. sometimes your own hormones can rule over the pill form that you are taking. other factors can also throw off your cycle like stress. sometimes women’s’ hormones can also \"talk\" to each other causing women in the same vicinity to become regulated to the same cycle. if you have just started a new job or school where you are hanging out with other women every day your cycles can become synced with theirs. before you start a new pill pack you may want to take an at-home pregnancy test. keep an eye on your cycles and if they are continually irregular you may need a different type of birth control."

    "Answer": "the chance of a pregnancy is not very high. this time but you are engaging in some very risky sexual behavior that could lead to a pregnancy situation in the future. i suspect this will not be the last time that you engage in these activities. clearly keeping a penis and sperm as far away from a vagina is the preferable. practice using condoms during your sex play; thus containing all of the semen or better yet have your partner get on an effective form of contraception. it is only a matter of time before your mutual passion and sexual excitation will lead to intercourse. then your chances are very good that an unintentional pregnancy will happen. you and your partner are engaging in risky sexual activities so act like a mature person. be proactive use more common sense. use birth control. and be very very careful."

    "Question": "what's the best kind of moisturizer to use with oily skin?",
    "Answer": "you should use moisturizers that are non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging). for individuals with oily skin the use of products that clog pores may lead to increased oil production. oily skin needs special cleansing with plenty of warm water and soap to prevent the pores from being clogged. avoid harsh products that strip your skin of oil and encourage flakiness. they can cause a reaction known as reactive seborrhea where the oil glands work overtime to compensate for the loss of natural oils. avoid skin-care products that leave your skin feeling taut and dehydrated. they cause the upper layers of the skin to shrink. this restricts oil flow through the pores leading to blockages and breakouts."

' this condition is not life threatening and often causes few symptoms. it can be treated pretty easily. i suggest you see a medical professional for further evaluation. wishing you well! as you have hurted your knee it may cause pain. pain due to trauma take time to heal. rest and proper exercise can reduce the pain and strain to the area affected."

    "Answer": "the conjunctiva the thin watery membrane that coasts the eye contains many small blood vessels. occasionally these blood vessels can burst and led to hemorrhage (bleeding) that appears as a red patch on the white of the eye. in the majority of cases this type of bleeding (called subconjunctival hemorrhage) occurs without a known cause. subconjunctival hemorrhage can also result from certain medical conditions including trauma high blood pressure eye infections and bleeding disorders. the straining associated with vomiting coughing or sneezing can also sometimes lead to subconjunctival hemorrhage. stress is not a recognized cause of subconjunctival hemorrhage. a conjunctival hemorrhage may be cosmetically annoying but they do not endanger the vision."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your baby is going through this. good for you for following the instructions to the letter in using the inhaler. it's very important to use all medications for infants exactly as prescribed. because your baby has developed new symptoms you should take her back to the pediatrician. although this may sound like the \"same\" cough as before her persistent coughing could be a sign of something else going on. your pediatrician will want to examine her and perhaps run additional tests to look for answers. meanwhile i would call the pediatrician's office to ask whether it is ok to continue using the inhaler. generally doctors like to see the patient when she is exhibiting symptoms. it may be uncomfortable for your baby to be coughing a lot but it also may be important for the doctor to see this during the examination. your pediatrician's office will guide you as to whether or not to treat the cough between now and your visit. wishing you well! really very sorry to hear what you and your child is going through at this age. i will say do follow what your doctor has said. for more information on many other inhalers you can visit pharmacysell."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer sorry to hear you went through that. it sounds awful! this definitely could have been a case of food poisoning. many packaged meats (including those from a deli) contain quite a few preservatives but the meat still could have gone bad after nine days. abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea chills fever headache and weakness all can be signs of food poisoning. the exact symptoms relate to the type of germ causing the food poisoning. also symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning usually start within 2 to 6 hours of consuming the contaminated food so your symtpoms match up with that timeframe. except for infants children the elderly pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems most people don't require treatment for food poisoning. it should go away on its own within a couple of days. the best thing to do is drink plenty of water and allow the diarrhea to flow. you want to let those bad germs get out of your body. if the diarrhea continues for more than three days it may be time to try an over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medication or consult a health care provider. i hope you're feeling better by now! you probably won't want any corned beef for awhile."

    "Question": "i am having right lower abdominal pain that increases with standing and taking deep breaths in. what might this be?",
    "Answer": "well it's hard to say. a number of conditions could be causing the pain you describe. unless you're running a fever you probably can safely take a \"watchful waiting\" approach to see if the situation improves. if you begin to run a fever you definitely should seek medical attention. lower-right quadrant pain frequently is associated with appendicitis. by the way appendicitis is considered a medical emergency so if you spike a fever and the pain gets worse you've won a ticket to the er. however many other non-emergency things could cause the pain you're describing. for example a piece of hard stool could be stuck in the intestine temporarily. this is a frequent cause of abdominal pain of all kinds. in this case the stool eventually moves on and the pain goes away. even a pocket of intestinal gas could cause the symptoms you describe. as always my usual advice in any medical situation is this: if things start moving toward \"worse\" instead of \"better \" see your health care provider. meanwhile get a thermometer (don't rely on whether or not you feel hot to the touch or anything of that sort) monitor your temperature (every four hours is fine) and just keep close tabs on the situation. chances are it will clear up on its own. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it?",
    "Answer": "shingles can occur in many areas of the body. if the outbreak is on his chest back abdomen etc. where it can be easily covered by clothing the risk of transfer will not be very high. if it is on his face then more caution against direct skin-to-skin contact should be exercised. assuming that he is currently under treatment usually with an oral anti-viral medication this will also reduce the chance of spreading it to others. your two year old is vulnerable assuming they had a varicella (chicken pox) vaccination at age one. if not exposure to shingles can actually give an unimmunized person chicken pox. for you assuming you had chicken pox as a child (or the vaccine) you are also vulnerable from direct skin-to-skin contact. do the best that you can without treating your husband like a leper. not everyone who is exposed will even get it but a few simple precautions like covering the area with clothing will help. my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus. if you expose him to it. he will only catch (chicken pox) which if you have it once you can never get it again"

    "Question": "have more than one symptom of preeclampsia doctor wont listen and run test what do i do? . im 28 wks pregnant and have been getting really dizzy and seeing white spots? i have told my doctor about it and she doesnt seemed concerned but i have also had spotting on and off and have these headaches i cant seem to get rid of. i get tired alot easier than normal and just dont feel right i have been getting nasueas recently and if i call my doctors office they say this is all normal and not to worry but im worried something is wrong and wondering should i get a second opinion?",
    "Answer": "i had preeclampsia with my son. all it took was a urine test for them to identify. you swell up all over too with it and my face was very swolen when they induced my labor. they check the amount of protein in your urine and if you have too much of it they run about two more urine tests where you pee in a bucket thing for 24 hours cause if it goes up so high you have to be induced for the danger it does you and the baby. mine wasn't allowing sky to gain weight and he was already practicing breathing for labor at 34 weeks. they induced me at 35 weeks and he was 4 lbs 2 oz when we left. when i had preeclampsia i felt hot all over and dizzy. especially when i showered or stood for very long. the point is though is that i was having the symptoms of preeclampsia for months before it came on full force symptoms like yours. the best thing that you can do is rest and rest a lot. stress brings it on that's how mine came on so you just need to not worry about it because they check your urine and every time you have an appointment that's one of the things they check for. as long as you don't have a high enough protein count in your urine you should be okay. when i had sky mine was so bad i couldn't see him until the next morning at i had him at 4:13 p. m. all you can do is take it easy. they'll let you know if you get into the danger zone that's one thing they check for every time you pee in the little cups they give you. i really hope this settles your fears. stress brings it on so try and relax for now."

    "Answer": "i can answer some of this. glucosamine has been known to help people (animals too) who have osteoarthritis it can sometimes help with pain and improve flexibility. it is more effective when combined with chondroitin. there are a lot of brands of joint supplement out there. generally avoid hard tablets and try to get gel caps. my spouse who has arthritis has had some help from the drink called joint juice - it seems to reduce some of the pain and inflammation and you can buy it at pharmacies. turmeric drunk as a tea or taken in capsules (you can make your own) or cooked into food helps inflammation naturally. sometimes spicy food can help too. gentle exercise like swimming and stretching can also help to some extent. certain forms of yoga tai chi and other low impact exercise might help. others might have information about your other questions but this is what i had for you so far."

    "Question": "is it normal to break out in a very itchy rash all over my arms legs and abdomen after i work out?",
    "Answer": "not that your experience is normal but it is more common than you think. the first thing to do is check any new clothing detergent or soap that you use. these products can cause allergic-type reactions in some people. if you rule out detergent soap or any other lotions then you should consider a possible allergic reaction during exercise due to the release of histamines. it's not that you are allergic to exercise but rather that you may be experiencing a biological response during or after you work out that mimics an allergic reaction. here's what could be happening and why. during exercise histamines are released. histamines are proteins involved in autoimmune responses like an allergic reaction to pollen or dust. people who are sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise just like you are describing. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but they can appear on the neck or arms too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (for example antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. the problem typically occurs more in cold weather than warm. if the problem bothers you so much that you can't stand it or it's not resolving on its own then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine like benadryl 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter antihistamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedating antihistamine. you should not take over-the-counter or prescription medications for this problem without speaking with your doctor."

    "Question": "why did i have an adverse reaction after taking gas x",
    "Answer": "it's possible to have an adverse reaction to any medication. many people think over-the-counter medications are somehow \"safer\" than prescription drugs. this is not the case. all drugs can (and do) cause adverse reactions in some people. among the many possibilities any given person could have an adverse reaction to: dyes in the product; inert ingredients in the product (such as fillers and binders); or the active ingredient itself. you don't say what symptoms you're interpreting as an \"adverse reaction \" but in general if you take any kind of medication (prescription or over-the-counter) and experience a rash swelling of the lips/tongue/face or difficulty breathing you should seek medical treatment. a rash alone does not necessarily warrant a trip to the emergency room but the other symptoms do. also in general once you have experienced an adverse reaction to a drug you should never take it again. if you have questions about any medications you take even over-the-counter ones you can always consult your health care provider or a pharmacist. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "how is osteoporosis diagnosed?",
    "Answer": "a routine x-ray can reveal osteoporosis of the bone because the bones appear much thinner and lighter than normal bones. unfortunately by the time x-rays can detect osteoporosis at least 30% of the bone has already been lost. in addition x-rays are not accurate indicators of bone density. thus the appearance of the bone on x-ray often is affected by variations in the degree of exposure of the x-ray film. the national osteoporosis foundation the american medical association and other major medical organizations recommend a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (dxa formerly known as dexa) for diagnosing osteoporosis. dxa measures bone density in the hip and the spine. the test takes only five to 15 minutes to perform exposes patients to very little radiation (less than one-tenth to one-hundredth of the amount used on a standard chest x-ray) and is quite precise. the bone density of the patient is compared to the average peak bone density of young adults of the same sex and race. this score is called the \"t score \" and it expresses the bone density in terms of the number of standard deviations (sd) below peak young adult bone mass. osteoporosis is defined as a bone density t score of -2. 5 or below. osteopenia (between normal and osteoporosis) is defined as bone density t score between -1 and -2. 5. it is important to note that while osteopenia is considered a lesser degree of bone loss than osteoporosis it nevertheless can be of concern when it is associated with other risk factors (such as smoking cortisone steroid usage rheumatoid arthritis family history of osteoporosis etc. ) that can increase the chances for developing vertebral hip and other fractures. in this setting osteopenia may require medication as part of the treatment program."

    "Answer": "i had the same problem severely a few years ago (almost every day to the point that i had to retire early). i improved quite a bit years ago with the help of a service dog who could sense when i was about to have an attack and alert me to take anti-anxiety medicine before the attack happened. however what really helped me at first was to take prophylactic medication until my generalized level of anxiety decreased. (i did relaxation desensitization therapy and other relaxation methods like yoga but it wasn't until the attacks reduced that any of it helped. ) in the meantime the best thing you can do for your friend is to help her with a solution for her real fear - vomiting in public. encourage her to carry a plastic zip-loc bag in her purse (so if she does get sick she won't make a mess that others will have to deal with) and tell her if she feels that she is going to be sick in public you will help her get to a private place to be sick if necessary. there is also an over-the-counter medication called emetrol that will calm the vomiting reflex and allow her to relax and calm down. i still have occasional serious nausea attacks but i always carry at least water and sometimes diet soda to calm my stomach. (for what it's worth i think my extreme anxiety on the subject was caused by a kindergarten classmate who vomited all over me during nap-time. ) the fear of vomiting in public is not typical but it can be very debilitating - and it is much more difficult to treat than a fear of heights or claustrophobia. it is virtually impossible to do progressive desensitization for vomiting - it's kind of difficult to \"partially\" vomit then relax!"

    "Answer": "a multivitamin with minerals is fine to take one that provides 100% daily value for most vitamins and minerals is recommended. multivitamins typically don't have the recommended amount for calcium so you want to check to see how much it contains and get the rest from diet. you both need 1000mg daily and most dairy products contain 300mg (1 cup milk/yogurt/1. 5 ounce cheese). also check the amount of vitamin d it contains as the recommended amount is 600iu and some supplements have less. that being said if you are low in vitamin d you will need to take more. i recommend you see your doctor for a physical and lab work and get your vitamin d levels checked. if you are low your doctor can make recommendations about how much to take. multivitamins also don't contain potassium -- an electrolyte people fall short on with low levels being associated with elevated blood pressure. potassium is found in fruits and vegetables so make sure you get plenty of produce. multivitamins also don't contain omega-3 fatty acids such as dha and epa found in fish. eating fish twice or week can help as can getting plant sources of omega 3 fatty acids found in flax walnuts and canola oil. sleep and eating patterns make a big difference for shift workers. the following article discusses tips on how to manage food and eating to help with getting adequate sleep. <link> good luck and stay healthy!"

    "Question": "is it okay to take lomotil lonox or imodium to relieve travelers' diarrhea?",
    "Answer": "when we look at anti-diarrheal agents the most important are those that stop symptoms immediately such as imodium and lomotil. we prefer imodium because it does not make you feel drugged and sleepy but does stop your symptoms. [note: imodium is one of several brand names for loperamide. lomotil and lonox are brand names for diphenoxylate combined with atropine]. remember that these agents do not cure the illness. they just stop you up and thus stop the cramping. these drugs are fine to take immediately right after you feel that urge and pass that first loose stool. it will make you feel better faster. some people think that it is not a good idea to take agents such as these with diarrhea because it's better to purge all the \"bad stuff\" that's in you. but a number of studies show taking something like imodium does not prolong illness. now people with high fever or bloody stools or terrible abdominal symptoms should not take these drugs. they should seek medical attention. for people with mild to moderate travelers' diarrhea there is nothing wrong with taking imodium and a dose of antibiotic at the same time. for mild diarrhea if you do not have an antibiotic or are just looking for temporary relief it is fine to take these drugs without an antibiotic. but if you're looking for a cure and want and need to move on with your travels in general it is good to take an antibiotic as well. one to three days of antibiotics will cure most cases of travelers' diarrhea."

    "Answer": "according to robert goldberg phd author of tabloid medicine: how the internet is being used to hijack medical science for fear and profit and co-founder of the center for medicine in the public interest \"the principle reason that people are charged is that hospitals want to avoid the appearance of wrong-doing and reduce the threat of having a law suit. if you don't charge for the mistake then you're admitting you made the mistake and the patient can go on to sue for damages. \" if you've suffered a medical error and were asked to pay for treatment that you didn't need take action: many patients although incensed pay charges without question. according to goldberg often times the simple act of speaking up is enough to get the hospital to drop the charges. \"in this particular case the first line of response is 'i'm not paying for it' \" goldberg says. contact your state's department of insurance to see if you live in a state that currently prohibits hospitals from charging patients for care to correct a medical error; a number of states currently do. you can also file a complaint with your state's department of health. if you're covered by medicare you can file a complaint by phone at 800-medicare. if you have insurance there's a good chance you'd look to receive coverage for any treatment you need. if your insurer hasn't already raised a red flag when the claim for the unnecessary care came through for payment contact the company and explain the situation. if all else fails contact an attorney to help you negotiate with the doctor or hospital. a resolution can likely be reached with discussions. if not you always have the option to sue."

    "Answer": "plyometrics is a very dangerous method of exercising. there are no exceptions and the damage is cumulative. plyometrics involve jumping and landing both involving high acceleration and impact forces. my premise is that all injuries (i. e. tissue damage) are caused by the application of forces that exceed the structural tolerances of the tissues injured. a bone fracture is an obvious example. simply put plyometrics exposes a trainee to injury level forces and this is unnecessary to gain the adaptive benefits of exercise. the problem is not just limited to the spectrum of acute athletic injuries. those high level forces that are not high enough to cause catastrophic tissue failure can still proceed to damage structures like articular cartilage and loosen joint systems (muscle insertions ligaments musculotendinous junctions) in a sub-clinical way. this risk is elevated because of the risk of slipping due to the nature of the exercise. these repeated impact forces contributes to chronic degenerative disease with osteoarthritis as the ultimate result. articular cartilage can be slowly and significantly damaged over time and this has now been shown on runners where sequential mris were done over about 4 years. many people do not know that this asymptomatic damage is irreversible and over time this cumulative damage becomes debilitating."

    "Question": "do antiviral agents protect people from the flu?",
    "Answer": "vaccination is the primary method for control of influenza; however antiviral agents have a role in the prevention and treatment of mainly influenza type a infection. regardless antiviral agents should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for vaccination. as of dec. 15 2010 the cdc published the following concerning antiviral medications: antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza. influenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to treat influenza or to prevent influenza. two fda-approved influenza antiviral medications are recommended for use in the united states during the 2010-2011 influenza season: oseltamivir (tamiflu) and zanamivir (relenza). oseltamivir and zanamivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza a and b viruses. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe complicated or progressive illness or who are hospitalized. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at higher risk for influenza complications based on their age and/or medical conditions; clinical judgment should be an important component of outpatient treatment decisions. antiviral medications currently recommended include oseltamivir and zanamivir based upon recent viral surveillance and resistance data indicating that >99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications. amantadine (symmetrel) and rimantadine (flumadine) should not be used because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza a viruses. oseltamivir should be used to provide treatment or chemoprophylaxis (prevention of the flu after exposure to the virus) for infants younger than 1 year of age when indicated. antiviral treatment can be considered for any previously healthy non-high-risk symptomatic outpatient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is not in the recommended groups based upon clinical judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. because antiviral resistance patterns may change over time clinicians should monitor local antiviral resistance surveillance data."

    "Question": "what are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis?",
    "Answer": "the symptoms of cystic fibrosis vary from person to person and over time. sometimes you will have few symptoms. other times your symptoms may become more severe. one of the first signs of cystic fibrosis (cf) that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis develop later. they are related to how cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory digestive or reproductive systems of the body. respiratory system signs and symptoms people who have cystic fibrosis have thick sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. this build-up of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. people who have cystic fibrosis tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. for example lung infections due to bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas are much more common in people who have cystic fibrosis. an infection caused by this bacteria may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. people who have cystic fibrosis have frequent bouts of sinusitis an infection of the air-filled spaces behind your eyes nose and forehead. frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-ki-tis) and pneumonia (nu-mo-ne-ah) also occur. these infections can cause long-term lung damage. as cystic fibrosis gets worse you may develop more serious complications such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-thor-aks) or collapsed lung; or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-ek-ta-sis). some people who have cystic fibrosis also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. digestive system signs and symptoms mucus that blocks tubes or ducts in your pancreas and prevents enzymes from reaching your intestines causes most digestive system signs and symptoms. without these enzymes your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky foul-smelling greasy stools. intestinal blockage also may occur especially in newborns. too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. a hallmark of cystic fibrosis in children is poor weight gain and growth. these children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food due to the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. as cystic fibrosis gets worse other complications may occur such as: pancreatitis (pan-kre-a-ti-tis). this is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed which causes pain. rectal prolapse. frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. diabetes. gallstones. reproductive system signs and symptoms men who have cystic fibrosis are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. this is the tube that delivers sperm from the testicle to the penis. a woman who has cystic fibrosis may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking her cervix or other cystic fibrosis complications. other signs symptoms and complications other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. cystic fibrosis causes your sweat to become very salty. as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. this can cause dehydration (a condition in which your body doesn't have enough fluids) increased heart rate tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death. cystic fibrosis also can cause clubbing and low bone density. clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. it develops late in cystic fibrosis because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. low bone density also tends to occur late in cystic fibrosis. it can lead to a bone-thinning disorder called osteoporosis."

    "Question": "compltd 2 wks of antibotics and medrol pack. still have sever pain in lung area plerasie. how long does plerasie last?",
    "Answer": "how long pleurisy lasts depends on the cause. pleurisy occurs when there is inflammation in the lining surrounding your lungs. the lining consists of two thin sheets (pleura). when something causes these sheets to become inflamed it can feel as though two pieces of sand paper are rubbing together and sharp pain occurs on both inhaling and exhaling. infections from a virus or bacterium including tuberculosis a blood clot (pulmonary embolism) trauma cancer collagen vascular diseases such as lupus or unknown (idiopathic) are common causes of pleurisy. since your doctor has prescribed antibiotics and steroids your diagnosis is probably an infection. once the infection has healed the pleurisy should improve. sometimes scar tissue develops in the pleura and chronic pain can result. talk to your doctor about your continued pain. if you have a cough or are a smoker this may be aggravating your problem. pain medications and cough suppressants may be helpful."

    "Answer": "many pediatricians still recommend waiting until your baby is a bit older -- 9 or 10 months -- before offering allergenic foods such as milk eggs peanuts tree nuts (such as walnuts or almonds) fish shellfish soy and wheat. even if there’s no added risk of causing an allergy they note that an allergic reaction may be easier to manage in an older baby. and some pediatricians concerned about the particular severity of allergic reactions to peanuts and shellfish still suggest staying away from them until your child is up to 3 years old. whole cow's milk should not be given to babies younger than 1 year old because the proteins in whole milk can irritate the stomach. yogurt and soft cheeses are fine however because the proteins in these dairy products are broken down and less likely to cause tummy trouble. you should also still wait until at least 1 – some experts say 2 -- to introduce honey which can cause a potentially serious disease called infant botulism."

    "Answer": "a dermatologist would be a good choice. their specialty is skin and many of them will do office procedures assuming this growth needs to be removed. many primary care providers will do this too but you will need to talk to your own to see if this is something he or she will see. this can be many things including a retained foreign body (like a splinter)."

    "Answer": "if you qualify for a tax credit you'll be able to take it right away in the form of lower monthly premiums. if you prefer you can also pay the full premium throughout the year and take the credit at tax time meaning the premiums are paid with after-tax dollars. generally you pay with after-tax dollars when you buy insurance on your own unlike employer sponsored plans which you do pay for with pre-tax dollars."

    "Answer": "i hate to break the news to you but vitamin b will not create \"extra energy\" in someone who is not vitamin b deficient (like pernicious anemia). the body stores very little nutrients from mulitple vitamins and will eliminate them if not needed. most vitamins and minerals are obtained from our diet. it is okay to take a multi-vitamin if your diet is not very good. any person who is \"weak\" or tired should be carefully examined by their medical provider to find out why. just taking vitamins may not solve this problem."

    "Question": "what is acne?",
    "Answer": "there's a reason it's called \"common acne\" -- nearly everyone suffers from outbreaks of pimples at some point in life. it starts when greasy secretions from the skin's sebaceous glands plug the tiny openings for hair follicles (plugged pores). if the openings are large the clogs take the form of blackheads: small flat spots with centers darkened by exposure to air. if the openings stay small the clogs take the form of whiteheads: small closed flesh-colored bumps. both types of plugged pores can develop into swollen tender inflammations or pimples or deeper lumps or nodules. cysts associated with severe cases of acne (cystic acne) are firm swellings below the skin's surface that become inflamed and sometimes infected. although acne remains largely a curse of adolescence about 20% of all cases occur in adults. acne commonly starts during puberty between the ages of 10 and 13 and tends to be worse in people with oily skin. teenage acne usually lasts for five to 10 years normally going away during the early 20s. it occurs in both sexes although teenage boys tend to have the most severe cases. women are more likely than men to have mild to moderate forms into their 30s and beyond. acne lesions are most common on the face but they can also occur on the neck chest back shoulders and upper arms. acne isn't caused by a harmful diet poor hygiene or an uncontrolled sex drive. the simple truth is that heredity and hormones are behind most forms of acne. swearing off chocolate or scrubbing your face 10 times a day won't change your predisposition to this unsightly sometimes painful and often embarrassing skin problem."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this and that the medications didn't give you any relief. when symtpoms persist after treatment it's always a good idea to return to the doctor to update him or her and get reevaluated. i'd suggest you do just that. tinea barbae is a type of folliculitis which is an inflammation of the hair follicle (the part of the hair that's embedded in your skin) caused by an infection. tinea barbae is caused by a fungus which is why your health care provider prescribed an anti-fungal cream (clotrimazole) to treat it. however since that didn't work it's time to get the rash re-checked. i'd suggest you also share with your doctor that over-the-counter lotions and creams made the rash worse. if possible tell him or her specifically which items you used. that may help get you a better diagnosis. good luck to you!"

    "Answer": "once you stretch or gauge your ears it will be permanent. it will not shrink back. you will either have to keep the stretched ear for life and hope that it will be fashionable when you are an adult or pay to have a plastic surgeon fix the deformity. i don't know if you are male or female but an 18 patient of mine who gauged his ears a few years ago decided to join the marines. the marines would not take him until he had his ears cosmetically repaired. he paid to have it done and now he serves our country. it is technically \"safe\" do this as long as you do not get an infection until it heals but something that looks cool when you are young doesn't look as cool when you are a working professional. rod is wrong. it is not always safe you have to wait at a minimum of two weeks before gauging up or you can blow out your ears (break the hole). he is also wrong about the fact that they will heal up depending on the size you have gauged to. a size 0 or bigger guarantees permanence smaller sizes do heal with time especially if you are young. also be sure to clean new products as sometimes you will bleed but if done right and slow you won't have that problem. i have 1/2 inch holes and many times i wear flower gauges that cover it and no one even notices. i think it's beautiful but to each his own."

    "Question": "does saliva kill sperm?",
    "Answer": "remember that sperm were designed to live in a moist warm environment with a certain ph. thus even though a bath tub/hot tub is a warm moist place water by itself (as opposed to a bath tub of normal saline) can hurt sperm by causing them to absorb unwanted water (osmotic shock). additionally hot tubs usually have chemicals which can change ph and add toxic to sperm chemicals. even the use of soap can strip sperm’s protective cell membranes off. sperm on hard surfaces remain mobile until they have dried out. the time for this to occur depends upon the environmental temperature and humidity. sperm are destined to swim in vaginal secretions and cervical mucus. a towel or men’s boxer shorts provide a barrier which is not occlusive as latex but it slows down sperm movement as some of them end up in the fabric where they dry out. laundry soap and hand washing will kill sperm on clothes and on fingers. sperm in the mouth have to contend with the enzymes in the saliva. suffice it to say that sperm outside the vagina or male reproductive organs will have a more difficult survival--at best 30 to 120 minutes under the most ideal conditions. that coupled with the need for an ovulating female makes pregnancy from this cause unlikely. hi this is not an answer but a queston i hope can be answered by a professional. i woke up and for some reason ejaculated in my sleep. i was with my girlfriend and she performed oral sex for a few min until i remembered what had happened. i went to the bathroom and used some soap and water quick to wash my penis and rinsed it after with a alittle water. then she performed oral sex briefly again and we had sex. is it a legitamite possiblilty that she could be pregnant? i did not come close to finishing we were intrrupted thanks"

    "Question": "tripped & fell. experienced excruciating knee pain when attempted to kneel 8 days later. xrays were normal. help!",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear about your fall. that's certainly never pleasant! it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical examination but i'm going to take a stab at this. i'm thinking you may have irritated or injured the patellar tendon where it attaches to the tibial tuberosity. let me explain that in laymen's terms. the patella of course is the kneecap. it is attached to the lower leg by a tendon. if you bend your knee and feel the very top of your shin bone you'll notice a bony bump. this is the tibial tuberosity (the 'tibia' being the medical term for your shin bone). the patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. if you fell onto that area of your knee you very likely may have injured the tendon. the bad news is this can take a long (long) time to heal. tendons have poor blood circulation which means the tissue doesn't get as much oxygen as say muscle tissue does. and since oxygen is crucial to tissue repair it takes tendons and ligaments much longer to heal than other body tissues. on the plus side it probably will heal eventually. assuming you did in fact injure the patellar tendon your best course of action is to avoid doing anything else to irritate it. that means no kneeling no activities that cause lots of bending (such as playing soccer) and things like that. rest will help your leg heal. if you're not allergic to them anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen can help the pain. if the pain persists you can always get re-checked to see if this is indeed a soft tissue injury. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article. i have a protein shake which relieves me of that felling of being hungry. protein! most protein shakes are specifically formulated for post workout fuel and also contain other useful ingredients for your muscles and recovery. if you want food cottage cheese tuna oatmeal peanut butter are good examples. you do need to eat before two hours. it is good unless it's liquid item then 1hr is sufficient. as for the hunger after exercising out you will always get hunger after even if you ate before. you burn a lot of calories when you workout and your body wants more. it's fine to eat after you workout. that's one of the few times that carbs are okay. after i workout i drink a carb drink that's 400 calories and 100 carbs. and then i drink my protein shake after that."

    "Answer": "the american academy of pediatrics recommends no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100% fruit juice for young children. at one year of age babies can switch from formula or breast milk to whole milk and it is recommended children get 2-3 cups but no more than 24 ounces. more than 24 ounces can increase the risk of iron deficiency since milk is poor source of iron and can fill up children's bellies. at 2 years 2 cups of milk is recommended but if a child doesn't drink milk he can get calcium from cheese and yogurt. children who don't drink milk will need a supplemental source of vitamin d. check with your pediatrician. as for total fluid requirements about 5 to 6 cups daily but don't push it. instead make water available between meals and milk and/or juice with meals."

    "Question": "what does it mean if i have blood in my semen?",
    "Answer": "blood in the semen is almost always nothing at all. it is a symptom of a small blood vessel probably breaking often during sex sometimes when men are bearing down with heavy lifting or straining sometimes with a difficult bowel movement if they’re constipated sometimes for no reason at all. so bright red blood in the semen speckled pink brown that happens. and unless it’s serious meaning it’s heavy and prolonged we just ignore it. it’s is not something to be worried about. it’s very scary. especially if you don’t know what to expect and suddenly you see blood in the semen then you panic. but it’s rarely a problem. now if you’re an older guy it could be a sign of prostate cancer or a kind of bladder cancer. but i’ve only seen that once in 20 years. it’s almost always nothing. in fact some of the major textbooks don’t even address the matter of seminal blood."

    "Answer": "this is very much a question for your medical team not for a forum like this one. no one here can possibly give an informed opinion because each case is different and the medical history of the individual is crucial in determining the best course of action. if you have questions about the risks and benefits of the suggested surgery have a long conversation with the surgeon and take plenty of notes. if possible have two or three people present for the meeting because the others will think of questions that might not even occur to you to ask. i wish you all the best!"

    "Answer": "infertility can be treated with medicine surgery artificial insemination or assisted reproductive technology. many times these treatments are combined. in most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery. doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on: test results how long the couple has been trying to get pregnant the age of both the man and woman the overall health of the partners preference of the partners doctors often treat infertility in men in the following ways: sexual problems: doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases. too few sperm: sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. in other cases doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count. sperm movement: sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. in some cases surgery can correct the problem. in women some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery. a number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. it is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. you should understand the possible dangers benefits and side effects."

    "Answer": "school children are incredibly good at passing a virus along. children naturally exhale more highly concentrated virus droplets than adults do. they also exhale them for longer periods of time. plus children are very active always in each other's faces. and there is a general lack of hygiene -- children don't wash their hands. they don't cover noses or mouths when they sneeze or cough. even more importantly they don't get very sick -- which means they continue to spread the virus while they are very contagious."

    "Question": "how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?",
    "Answer": "the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear."

    "Question": "under health-care reform when will there be fewer restrictions on mental-health sessions? . why is an insurance company allowed to limit how many therapy sessions a patient can have a year?",
    "Answer": "last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans — typically offered by employers — from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you haven’t been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a “pre-existing condition” – and insurers also won’t be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders."

    "Answer": "hi the ph of your vagina can easily be upset from having your period engaging in sex and experiencing hormonal fluctuations can all upset the ph balance of your vagina as can birth control pills exercise feminine deodorants tampons pregnancy stress and soap. if not dealt with quick it could encourage a yeast infection. a ph imbalance and related infections can happen to anyone. your best defence is to maintain a healthy vaginal ph. here are some ways to do that. this requires nothing more than a healthy lifestyle and basic principles of hygiene. keep the area clean and dry. a regular bathing schedule including cleaning of the area with plain water is enough. after bathing dab the area with a dry towel. douching is actually harmful. it washes away the beneficial bacteria that stay in the vaginal region. this disturbs the vaginal ph and the area becomes prone to dryness and infections. similarly avoid the use of harsh soaps on the area. wear loose cotton based undergarments most of the time particularly at night times. they allow the area to breathe while you sleep. better still sleep naked if you can. being shaved also prevents a place for fungus to hide. one should prevent moisture getting trapped in the vaginal area. moistness predisposes to fungal infections. avoid excess of tea coffee and other carbonated drinks that directly influence the vaginal ph. too much of junk food is bad. processed food contains lots of salts preservatives that affects the flora of the region and hence the health. eat healthy. actually it is our diet that is the key point to have a healthy body including a healthy vagina. consume plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. drink plenty of water. fresh fruit juices and yoghurt are the best to restore back the vaginal ph. maintain hygiene in the area. always wipe off from front to back never the other way. change your sanitary napkins frequently. practice safe sex always. change condoms when required. avoid taking hormonal pills. hope something here helps your problem. good luck"

    "Answer": "congratulations on your stoke recovery and smoking cessation. i smoked 2 1/2 packs of cigarettes per day and made a conscious decision to stop before overt signs of lung or heart disease surfaced. i read that a person who stops smoking at the age of 50 adds six years to their life expectancy. people who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50%. but with a history of smoking for 40 years lung and heart disease can still materialize even after years of abstinence. for example i stopped smoking almost 30 years ago and thought that i was out of woods only to have been recently diagnosed with c. o. p. d. (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and a right-sided heart block. the great news is that you will have decreased by 50% after 10 years of non-smoking your chances of succumbing to cancer of the mouth throat esophagus bladder cervix and pancreas. yes it is possible that you have emphysema. please make an appointment to be evaluated by your personal physician. chances are that he or she will request chest x-rays blood work an e. k. g. and other studies. they may also refer you to a cardiologist pulmonologist gastroenterologist and other medical specialist for consultation. you've come so far and deserve an opportunity to lead a productive life. after all you're only 50 years old and should have many good years in the future. please do not dismiss the shortness of breath and changes in the anatomical look of your stomach accompanied with distress. call your doctor without delay."

    "Answer": "you need to call your gynecologist as soon as possible to determine if you are in fact pregnant or if you're having trouble with your iud. an intrauterine device (iud) is considered an effective birth control method so you should not be able to get pregnant. however no form of birth control is 100% foolproof. if you are pregnant and have an iud it's important to get a diagnosis as soon as possible. you can't go through an entire pregnancy with an iud in place. it's also possible for an iud to become dislodged or penetrate the uterine wall. in short a number of scenarios could cause the symptoms you describe and you need to find out what's going on as soon as possible. best wishes to you!"

    "Answer": "i'm assuming the splotches go away eventually after your shower? if so it sounds like you're describing a normal situation. whenever a person takes a warm or hot shower the skin's blood vessels dilate from the heat. this causes two noticeable effects. first dilated vessels within the skin become much more visible. second when blood vessels dilate there's less pressure inside them. less pressure means it's harder for the heart to pump that blood all the way up from the feet to the chest. so when you see those blotchy patches on the lower extremities after a shower you're usually just seeing areas of dilated blood vessels. this is not a dangerous situation like a blood clot or anything. it's a normal phenomenon that occurs to a lot of people when they take a hot shower. it is especially noticeable in fair-skinned people because the blood vessels are much easier to see. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month. in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus. but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone \"stabilizes\" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding--this is likely what has happened to her. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. lastly less than 10% of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder. this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand's syndrome. given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md. a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about. this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces 2. i get mine every 14 das alsoand always have and i am 22. my mom had the same thing."

    "Answer": "hi this piece is from the dhs from the uk it may help you. good luck you can get chlamydia through: unprotected vaginal sex unprotected anal sex unprotected oral sex your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new condom between each person who uses them sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass chlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina anus or mouth. this means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the infection even if there is no penetration orgasm or ejaculation. it isn’t clear if chlamydia could be passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers. infected semen or vaginal fluid can cause conjunctivitis if it gets into someone’s eye."

    "Answer": "there's really not much point in washing your face before exercise. you need to cleanse your skin after exercising and sweating in order to make sure you don't develop blocked pores or possible fungal infections of the skin. interestingly it's equally important to thoroughly dry your skin after exercising. fungal infections such as \" jock itch \" can arise if the skin stays damp. so be sure to towel off thoroughly and perhaps apply powder if you can't get completely dry. ps: women can get \"jock itch \" too. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "menstrual cramps very common. there are few different ways that can be treated. the first way is actually through a heating pad or using something like thermacare makes a heat wrap that could be applied to the inside of the clothing and it'll provide heat. and heat has been found to be very beneficial in treating that. also where appropriate you could take things like ibuprofen or motrin advil or even aleve. we want to make sure that the patients understand they need to take this with food. on a full stomach because if you don't you might experience a little bit of an upset stomach or some stomach cramping. and also just try to get some rest and eat well. so many times females are running around they are trying to take care of our families and do a lot of different things. but we forget to take care of ourselves at the end of the day. so just making sure that you get a little extra sleep around this particular time of the month and also making sure that you are eating well that's very important as well."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer no problem. many times a diagnosis of \"measles\" at age three may have been incorrect. measles is relatively rare in the u. s. so unless you saw a definitive test that proved you had measles getting a vaccine would be appropriate. if you have immune antibodies the measles injection will not be harmful. if you didn't have antibodies against measles the vaccine will provide them for you now."

    "Question": "how do i appeal a denied health insurance claim?",
    "Answer": "internal review: your first step is to request an internal review of the decision you want overturned by your health plan. your insurer should send you instructions explaining how to do this and the deadlines you'll have to meet. it must also send you a notice once it has reached a final decision and include an explanation of the outcome. here are some documents you'll want to start collecting in order to initiate the appeal: your insurance plan or group number and/or social security number your doctor's name and the bill for the services in question description of the service you want covered and why explanation of benefits (eob) forms copy of the health plan booklet section that describes coverage related to treatment copies of the medical records that relate to the service or treatment in question external review: if you're not satisfied with your insurance company's ruling you have the right to an external review which is conducted by an independent third party (often your state insurance department). your health plan should include information about how to file an external appeal in the notice it sends you. if you haven't gotten the information and get your insurance at work talk with your human resources department to ask for help. you can also contact the u. s. department of labor's employee benefits advisors (866-444-3272). your state's insurance commissioner's office is a great place to go for help too; many are setting up consumer assistance programs that work with consumers on health insurance appeals. for more detailed information about appeals processes under the law see \" your right to appeal \" on the nonprofit families usa website."

    "Question": "does caffeine cause heart disease?",
    "Answer": "with the high prevalence of heart disease links between lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity are undergoing extensive research. the original research into caffeine's role in this epidemic resulted in conflicting answers. some evidence suggests an elevation in stress hormones from caffeine consumption that could pose a cardiovascular risk but recent research has shown no relationship between caffeine ingestion and heart disease. in fact studies have actually shown a protective effect against heart disease with habitual intake of caffeinated beverages in the elderly population. the reason for the discrepancy may be due to the kind of beverage being consumed. studies have shown that coffee and tea were not associated with increases in blood pressure or arrhythmias while soft drinks were. research also showed that decaffeinated coffee and tea did not provide the same benefits as the caffeinated versions. the well-respected framingham heart study examined all potential links between caffeine intake and cardiovascular disease and found no harmful effects from drinking coffee. there can however be exceptions to this. people react differently to caffeine and some may experience elevations in blood pressure or arrhythmias. the blood pressure elevations are said to be short lived lasting no more than several hours and are comparable to modest elevations experienced climbing a flight of stairs. it's always best to check with your physician if you are experiencing any side effects."

    "Answer": "hi and wow 21 years is this a record. but can see why women who have been on it between 5 to 10 years can take up to 2 years to get there periods back so you can see why he's bringing you off it. who knows you may have already gone through it. ok not knowing how these shots affect your hormones perhaps you should have a blood test done now and once every 3 months so your doctor can keep an eye on them its from your hormones that he can tell about the menopause. hope this helps. good luck"

    "Question": "what can people with bipolar disorder expect from treatment?",
    "Answer": "bipolar disorder has no cure but can be effectively treated over the long-term. it is best controlled when treatment is continuous rather than on and off. in the step-bd study a little more than half of the people treated for bipolar disorder recovered over one year's time. for this study recovery meant having two or fewer symptoms of the disorder for at least eight weeks. however even with proper treatment mood changes can occur. in the step-bd study almost half of those who recovered still had lingering symptoms. these people experienced a relapse or recurrence that was usually a return to a depressive state. if a person had a mental illness in addition to bipolar disorder he or she was more likely to experience a relapse. scientists are unsure however how these other illnesses or lingering symptoms increase the chance of relapse. for some people combining psychotherapy with medication may help to prevent or delay relapse. treatment may be more effective when people work closely with a doctor and talk openly about their concerns and choices. keeping track of mood changes and symptoms with a daily life chart can help a doctor assess a person's response to treatments. sometimes the doctor needs to change a treatment plan to make sure symptoms are controlled most effectively. a psychiatrist should guide any changes in type or dose of medication."

    "Answer": "hi if you read up about the side effects and bleeding what you read and what happening now should just be a side effect of the pill you took. if you miss your next period date its either because of the pill or you could be pregnant for the second one just get a test done if negative. then that would be the time that you should think of bc either the pill the implant the ring the cap or iud as protection against getting pregnant. just think safe sex any form of unprotected sex could end up with you being pregnant. good luck"

    "Answer": "hello first a disclaimer: i am not a professional anything. just a sociology degree and anemia most of my life. has your woman friend been tested to explain her anemia? i was literally anemic for almost 50 years and when no one could find the reason they just gave up but being anemic really affected me. i finally found a hematologist who did a test that measured how much epo (the drug that cyclists were using illegally) which i believe is a hormone my kidneys produced. this was an \"ah ha\" moment because epo is what 'tells' the cells in our bone marrow to produce red blood cells. it turns out that my kidneys don't produce enough (lazy things<positive_smiley>. i ended up receiving shots of epo weekly. it certainly made me feel better. if she can't walk (ms right? ) can a physical therapist(pt) come to your home and at least help her exercise her extremities? i know my wheelchair-bound neighbor has a pt come in a few times a week. speaking from experience it's so difficult to get someone to exercise. no type of encouragement seems to work. i imagine she isn't feeling very 'happy' to be blunt. i imagine you have already contacted the doc about her 'fade-outs' 'heart beat' etc. my heart beat used to get very very slow and my head would drop to the desk as if i had fainted. do you suppose there is a connection between her heart and her symptoms? good luck to you and your friend. lastly i so hope you have a doctor who cares. a really good doctor who displays their compassion and concern can make all the difference."

    "Answer": "bee-keeping hoods do not really touch the eyes and they appear to be well-ventilated so i would assume that it would not be very likely for the suit to be a major factor in transmitting microorganisms. most of the time an object of clothing may be blamed but in reality it was most likely unwashed contaminated hands that were the vector for pink eyes. you could try and disinfect the hoods between kids if that is possible or even logistically feasible."

    "Answer": "see your doctor for a referral to a cardiologist so that your heart and oxygen saturation can be carefully monitored while running on a treadmill. this is called a stress test. while it would not be unusual for someone's heart rate to go up this high it would be comforting to know that your heart is capable of handling the load. the fact that you have been active for 18 years is wonderful so i am sure you will pass with flying colors but when you are in your mid-60's it would be good to get the official \"okay\". i just turned 60 and am now 7 years post emergency bypass surgery. if you are perfectly comfortable playing squash with your heart rate that high not out of breath not breathing hard or panting no chest pain then you simply have fantastic fitness. its a whole body activity utilizing legs and tush as you move about the floor and back and ab muscles as you lean in all directions to move for the ball and start and stop. just be sure you eat a very healthy diet plenty of anti-oxidant rich foods every day and keep a lid on saturated fats in the diet. with a bad diet your heart can develop an alternative capillary network that feeds it as major arteries become blocked from bad diet with good exercise. this does not happen to every one but i have this and i know of a fellow about 60 miles away who does also. he also recently had bypass surgery."

    "Answer": "that will be up to his medical provider to decide. while there are blood tests (ebv panel and liver function tests) that can determine the current status of this pesky viral infection a hands-on examination may be necessary to know if he is now good-to-go. since some \"daily activities\" may include contact or collision sports (like football) it is best to get the patient-specific okay from his doctor or health care professional. the fact that he is feeling great is the best news of course so the mono may have completely resolved by this four week mark."

    "Answer": "rinsing the canned vegetables will lower a little salt but food cooked in salt are more likely to have salt in the foods that will not rinse out. just switch to frozen or fresh vegetables where you can control the salt better. they even taste better (once your body no longer graves the salty-tastes). salt is an acquired taste so it take time to unacquire it."

    "Answer": "your boyfriend may already have hpv so don't be afraid to tell him. honesty is the best and safest policy when involved in a sexual union. if he has had previous partners like you have he could have already been infected. if not from you from someone else. if you have hpv in your mouth or throat you could transmit it orally vaginally or even anally. it depends on where you have it. i know you have heard this before but the use of condoms will certainly limit the spread of hpv to your sexual partner. or any future partner."

    "Answer": "if your doctor was not able to find a reason for your ear pain and hearing changes then you need to see an ent specialist for a higher-level examination. tmj and bruxism (grinding the teeth) doesn't cause hearing loss but it can cause ear pain. many dentists now specialize in tmj disorders so finding one would be quite helpful in tracking down the reasons. ear pain can be caused by infection or referred pain from other head and neck areas like your throat lymph nodes salivary glands cervical spine tonsils (if you have them) sinuses and nerve disorders. just because one doctor could not find a cause does not mean a second medical provider like an ent will have the same conclusion."

    "Answer": "i have no way of determining how long your tinnitus (ringing) might last. acoustic damage to the ear from concerts can be severe but unfortunately i have no way of determining the decibel level you experienced or know if you permanently damaged your ears. my guess would be that you will be fine in a week or so like your doctor mentioned but again that is just a guess. you have learned a very valuable lesson about acoustic injury. we live in a world of protective devices. children wear helmets when they ride a bike. football players not only wear high-tech helmets but an array of modern day armor. people wear safety glasses to protect their eyes when woodworking or playing racket ball. who is protecting our ears and precious hearing? it has been estimated that more than 30 million americans are exposed to dangerous sound levels on a regular basis and an estimated 10 million already have hearing loss from the noise. (<link> how loud is loud? many experts feel that prolonged levels above 85db can cause permanent damage to hearing. knowing this why are movie theaters blasting our ears with levels that often reach 100db? concerts have levels that start at 100db and rise to levels above 130 db. even echoing sports arenas have 80-100db levels depending on the enthusiasm of the crowd. you do have to wait it out for now but if your ringing does not abate in a few weeks you will need to see an ear specialist."

    "Answer": "bad smells can definitely be a hygiene issue or caused by a variety of bacterial and fungal organisms (like yeast). yeast can be common in uncircumcised males and you must retract that foreskin and clean it with soap and water; rinse and repeat. you may want to try some anti-yeast medication like monistat cream to see if this solves the issue. if not you should see your medical provider for a proper exam. the fact that you contracted both gonorrhea and chlamydia tells me that your choice of partners may not be wise and that you are not using condoms. two behavioral suggestions that may help prevent future infections."

    "Answer": "to prevent high blood pressure first consider your diet. a healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing high blood pressure. trying following the dietary approaches to stop hypertension eating plan also known as the dash diet which emphasizes plenty of fruits and vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products. studies conducted by the national institutes of health have shown that the dash diet can dramatically lower blood pressure. and the results show up fast? often within two weeks. at the same time cut down on salt (sodium chloride) which can raise blood pressure. the national high blood pressure education program recommends no more than 2 300 milligrams of sodium a day. the ideal is even lower? only 1 500. for the average man who consumes about 4 200 milligrams a day that requires a big change. but studies show that the lower your salt intake the lower your blood pressure. along with a healthier diet it is smart to be as active as possible to prevent high blood pressure. in 2007 researchers at the university of minnesota published results from a study of almost 4 000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 who were followed over time. the more active they were the lower their risk of developing hypertension. a few other changes can also keep your blood pressure in check. both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can raise blood pressure. men who drink alcohol should stick to no more than two standard drinks a day. and if you smoke the advice is obvious: get serious about quitting."

    "Question": "can an asthma attack be triggered by traveling from high altitude to a low altitude destination? . my 6 year old son traveled with his father from colorado to north carolina for a vacation. he has a history of mild asthma with only one previous attack a year ago accompanied by a cold. he did not have any symptoms of a cold when he left and no trouble breathing. 45 minutes after arriving in north carolina he had a severe asthma attack and was treated by airport paramedics with two albuteral nebulizer treatments. could this be caused by going from one climate to another?",
    "Answer": "most definitely! i have worked in the field of respiratory therapy for 35 years. anyone who suffers from asthma must be very careful when traveling from lower altitudes to higher altitudes. the difference in temperatures alone can trigger an asthma attack not to mention the humidity. humidity in lower elevations is much thicker that in higher elevations. before traveling next time ask you doctor to give you a prescription for inhalers which consist of xopenex and atrovent. the xopenex is quick acting for acute attacks while the atrovent is a longer lasting maintanence medication which wards off attacks. you may also consider traveling with a nebulizer that can be used in a car (ac/dc/battery) or anywhere for that matter. also when exercising in higher elevations always remember to monitor you breathing. you may want to also invest in a small pulse oximeter which can be purchsed at pharmacies home care stores or the internet. hope this information helps you."

    "Question": "how long does it take to feel results of topiramate 25 to releive migraines? have taken for 3 days- no results. should i contact dr to increase dosage or does it take time to build up in my system?",
    "Answer": "this medication is not used to relieve a migraine per say. it is used to help prevent migraines and make it so that when u do get one its not as severe. this medication has to build up in your system. people usually start with 25mgs for a week then 50mgs for a week and so on till u usually reach 100mgs or what ever your your dr has perscribed. it does work very well. but i have to warn you the side effects can be bad for about the 1st month and then they will get better. my sister is also on it and she called it dopamax cause of how she felt at first. if u have a migraine u need to take some sort of abortive med like excridine migraine or imatrex or whatever your dr has told u to use. i hope this helps. topamax is a great medicine and should work very well just hang in there."

    "Question": "what are the advantages of strength training for weight loss?",
    "Answer": "strength training is another form of exercise that helps you burn calories to lose weight. strength training also has the added benefit of helping you preserve muscle as well. if you lose weight while only doing cardiovascular exercise some of the weight loss may come from muscle as well as body fat. we want to preserve that muscle because it can help to boost metabolism since muscle burns calories at a higher rate than fat. strength training can also help to promote a more “toned” appearance another added benefit for you. the surgeon general recommends that you strength train all major muscle groups two or more days per week."

    "Question": "healthy 40 year old male. platelet count 124. normal bp all other numbers are normal. anything to be worried about? . 6'1\" 190 lbs. . 132 cholesterol. . somewhat active. . take 2 aspirin twice a week and two days before my last test. . . .",
    "Answer": "platelets are the blood cells that stick together to form clots and thereby stop bleeding. just to clarify your number i'm assuming you mean your platelet count is 124 000 because platelets normally number in the hundreds of thousands. that is a bit on the low side for a male your age. you'd be well-advised to follow up with your health care provider to make sure this doesn't require any additional investigation. it probably isn't significant but because platelets stop bleeding you don't want to ignore a low platelet count. by the way taking aspirin doesn't reduce your platelet count. aspirin makes platelets less \"sticky \" so they don't clump together. it's unclear to me if you take aspirin as a sort of regimen (that is on a routine basis whether you need it or not) or if you normally take a few aspirin every week for headaches muscle aches or that sort of thing. if you're taking aspirin as a regimen i would advise you to stop doing so unless instructed by a doctor. many people have heard taking aspirin routinely can be good for the heart (and that's true) but this sort of aspirin regimen should only be done under the supervision of a health care professional. wishing you all the best!"

    "Answer": "some common drugs used to treat infertility in women include: clomiphene citrate (clomid): this drug causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. it is often used in women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) or other problems with ovulation. this medicine is taken by mouth. human menopausal gonadotropin or hmg (repronex pergonal): this medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. it is an injected medicine. follicle-stimulating hormone or fsh (gonal-f follistim): fsh causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. these drugs are usually injected. gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn-rh) analog: these drugs are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. these drugs are usually injected or given with a nasal spray. metformin (glucophage): doctors use this drug for women who have insulin resistance and/or pcos. this drug is usually taken by mouth. bromocriptine (parlodel): this drug is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production. many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins triplets or other multiples. women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems."

    "Answer": "what you are doing is not a baby dance but more of a baby lottery. while it may be considered safe to have sex without any form or contraception at the end of your menstrual cycle please keep in mind that sperm has this annoying habit of remaining viable for days in your genital tract. if you ovulate early you may have some rogue sperm hanging around and anxious to find an egg. if you do not want an unintentional pregnancy you will need to take viable steps to prevent it. not play the lottery. i have no idea if this act will result in a pregnancy so you will need to sweat it out and wait. do a pregnancy test if you are having any signs of pregnancy or miss your next period."

    "Question": "how is a hernia repaired?",
    "Answer": "a hernia repair requires surgery. there are several different procedures that can be used for fixing any specific type of hernia. in the open surgical approach following appropriate anesthesia and sterilization of the surgical site an incision is made over the area of the hernia and carried down carefully through the sequential tissue layers. the goal is to separate away all the normal tissue and define the margins of the hole or weakness. once this has been achieved the hole is then closed usually by some combination of suture and a plastic mesh. when a repair is done by suture alone the edges of the defect are pulled together much like sewing a hole together in a piece of cloth. one of the possible complications of this approach is that it can put excessive strain on the surrounding tissues through which the sutures are passed. over time with normal bodily exertion this strain can lead to the tearing of these stressed tissues and the formation of another hernia. the frequency of such recurrent hernias especially in the groin region has led to the development of many different methods of suturing the deep tissue layers in an attempt to provide better results. in order to provide a secure repair and avoid the stress on the adjacent tissue caused by pulling the hole closed an alternative technique was developed which bridges the hole or weakness with a piece of plastic-like mesh or screen material. the mesh is a permanent material and when sewn to the margins of the defect it allows the body's normal healing process to incorporate it into the local structures. hernia repair with mesh has proved to be a very effective means of repair. after the hernia repair is completed the overlying tissues and skin are surgically closed usually with absorbable sutures. more and more of hernia repairs are now being done using laparoscopic techniques (see below)."

    "Answer": "the symptoms of brain tumors depend on tumor size type and location. symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or damages a certain area of the brain. they also may be caused when the brain swells or fluid builds up within the skull. these are the most common symptoms of brain tumors: headaches (usually worse in the morning). nausea or vomiting. changes in speech vision or hearing. problems balancing or walking. changes in mood personality or ability to concentrate. problems with memory. muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions). numbness or tingling in the arms or legs. these symptoms are not sure signs of a brain tumor. other conditions also could cause these problems. anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. only a doctor can diagnose and treat the problem."

    "Question": "are folate and l-methylfolate (lmf) helpful for treating depression?",
    "Answer": "this is a vitamin-type product that seems to be turning the corner from a good idea to a reasonable almost proven treatment for depression. 1) folate is an essential nutrient in our diet. it can be found in spinach lentils liver asparagus beans and collard greens. some research studies have shown that folate tablets can help treat depression but these are small and poorly regulated studies. 2) your liver takes the folate you eat in your diet and converts it to a special form of brain folate called l-methylfolate (lmf). however your liver has the ability to only convert a little bit of regular folate into brain lmf at a time. therefore you can eat all the spinach in the world but still only get little bits of lmf into your brain at a time. 3) once in the brain lmf has the theoretical ability to provide nerves with the ability to make more neurotransmitters such as serotonin. this boost in serotonin allows antidepressants that work by manipulating serotonin to have a greater chance to work their antidepressant mechanisms. lmf tablets are available by prescription now as they are considered a medical food similar to prenatal vitamin classifications. 4) more stringent research studies that compare lmf to placebo sugar pills are being published and scrutinized and it appears that adding lmf products to antidepressants may improve depression symptoms. these studies are preliminary in nature but are clearly better regulated and supportive in that lmf may be safe and help in the treatment of depression. larger 400 patient studies are needed to prove definitive antidepressant effects but these current medium sized studies are promising."

    "Question": "can exercise help with a hiatal hernia and do alcohol or tobacco have any effect on (pantoprazole) protonix?",
    "Answer": "exercise has no effect on hiatal hernias. exercise however can increase acid reflux in people who are prone to acid reflux presumably those individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter muscles. exercise increases intra-abdominal pressure and can force stomach acid back into the esophagus through a weak lower esophageal sphincter. the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the effectiveness of protonix or related drugs (proton pump inhibitors or ppis) are minimal. however both alcohol and tobacco aggravate the underlying acid-related conditions for which protonix is used and they should be discouraged."

    "Answer": "based on a list of symptoms alone there is really no way to blindly determine over the internet if a person is pregnant or have \"something more serious\". you will need to have a hands-on examination with your primary care medical provider or your ob/gyn. you will most likely need some diagnostic blood tests or perhaps even an ultrasound."

    "Answer": "i highly doubt that you are pregnant. stress and worry can cause irregular periods. also pre-cum doesn't always carry sperm especially if you partner has urinated since he ejaculated last. you might have had implantation bleeding if you had been pregnant but you certainly wouldn't have had a second period. regarding the peeing four times frequent urination doesn't usually start until the fetus is quite large like the third trimester or so. nausea could come from feeling nervous or a garden variety cold or flu bug."

    "Answer": "the best birth control would be the one you (and your partner) will use consistently. yes depo provera and even birth control pills have side-effects. only condoms and abstinence are side-effect free. if you don't think you would be consistent with taking a pill you may not be a candidate for a diaphragm either which requires a vaginal insertion before sex. a nuvaring also requires vaginal insertion too but only once a month. you may want to investigate implanon / nexplanon; a progesterone-only implant that is good for three years. this too may have side effects so you will have to see what the best fit would be. i agree that an iud may not be a good choice for someone who has not ever been pregnant. a visit to your medical provider or planned parenthood would be wise to discuss these and other methods."

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of transient ischemic attack or tia?",
    "Answer": "the intensity and location of the blood limitation to the brain will determine what symptoms will be present as a result of a stroke or transient ischemic attack. many people present with confusion weakness and lethargy. if the loss of blood supply is in an area supplied by the carotid arteries a classic presentation may include weakness or paralysis and numbness of one side of the body. the whole side may be affected or just one limb. often there is a facial droop. if the stroke is on the left side of the body where the speech centers are located there may be difficulty understanding words or speaking. partial vision loss may also be part of the constellation of symptoms. strokes involving the vertebral arteries decrease blood supply to the base of the brain and may cause a drop attack (a sudden fall while walking or standing and then a quick recovery) an unexpected collapse incoordination or difficulty walking. the important distinction between stroke and tia is resolution of the symptoms. by definition the symptoms of a tia must completely resolve. and while this most often occurs within the first few minutes after symptom onset it may take up to 24 hours to have complete return to normal. a special type of tia is amaurosis fugax. transient blindness in one eye occurs because debris from a narrowed carotid artery clogs the artery (ophthalmic artery) that supplies blood to the back of the eye."

    "Question": "could i get genital herpes/hsv-2 by kissing someone who has it? or would i only get hsv-1 potentially that way? . i've read through a lot of data on herpes but am still confused about this. let's say that a woman has genital herpes. if i kiss her and end up contracting herpes from her will it be genital herpes/hsv-2 or would it be the more common hsv-1 herpes? . a shorter way of asking it is: can you only transmit hsv-1 through mouth-to-mouth contact?",
    "Answer": "you see? i answered your question so quickly i even confused myself. if you kiss someone with genital herpes (hsv-2) you cannot get herpes (oral or genital) from them. hsv-2 can only spread through direct contact. meaning you would need skin-to-skin contact with your infected friend's genital area to get herpes. and in that case the type of herpes you'd get would be hsv-2. hope that helps! to answer your question directly: if you kiss someone with active oral herpes you cannot get genital herpes from that contact. but that's not the end of the story. the old way of thinking was that herpes simplex 1 (oral herpes or cold sores) could not \"turn into\" herpes simplex 2 (genital herpes). however research has shown that's not exactly the case. however if you kiss someone with a cold sore then you can only get a cold sore (theoretically speaking). now if someone with a cold sore on her lip kisses your genitals then it's another story. in that scenario you could possibly wind up with genital herpes. i should mention too that the person you're kissing (or who's kissing you) doesn't have to have a visible active lesion to transmit the disease. in fact it's possible to be infected with hsv-1 and not even know it. and that's why it's all so confusing. wishing you well! hi i believe i have herpes. i had an outbreak (horrible) could not wear underwear and had to wear a dress just to walk. this is absolutely horrible and am surprised that no one has found a cure. why not? also i keep getting sores all over my abdomen (1 sore) and scarred my lips (swelled and another sore) could this be something else? i have never recovered from my first outbreak and am irritated all the time. i also have a dry rash on my back and front area that has not gone away. is all of this connected? please help. i have not dated and gained weight so no one would be attracted to me or want to ask me out. this is a very sad disease. please respond"

    "Answer": "i wish i could explain this but it's impossible to know what happened without knowing the specifics involved. percocet (generic name: oxycodone-apap) is an oral tablet taken by swallowing. usually post-surgical pain is treated with intravenous (iv) medication not pills. it's possible your post-surgical blood pressure issues had nothing to do with the percocet. normally low blood pressure in the recovery room is treated with iv fluids. i don't know what \"reversal drug\" you were given for the percocet. i'm going to assume you received naloxone (brand name: narcan). i don't know why this would cause you to feel as if you were having a heart attack. i could speculate but that would be of no use. if you are truly concerned about this i advise taking it up with the surgeon who performed your knee replacement surgery. he should have access to the anesthesia and nursing records that show exactly what medications you were given the times they were given and the dosages you received. perhaps your surgeon could shed some light on what happened. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "as a diabetic you are considered to be immunocompromised -- more prone to infections and more prone to infections becoming serious. pseumomonas is among the most common organisms that cause otitis externa so this is not uncommon. having painful \"cold sores\" (herpes) in the ear is more rare but does happen. think of it as having shingles in the ear. the disease is called ramsay-hunt syndrome assuming you were properly diagnosed. the treatment of a bacterial infection is with antibiotics but a viral infection like herpes requires antiviral medications. if you have not seen an ear specialist or dermatologist this may be something to consider since having a definitive diagnosis is essential if you are to be properly treated."

    "Answer": "there are very few scientifically tested methods of enlargement. yes there are surgical options but they are not all considered \"safe and effective\" and they carry risks including scar tissue formation which can result in erectile pain and even shortening of the erect penis. the andropenis device has some encouraging data that suggest it may be used for enlargement. however there are no (very) long term safety data on its use and it does require extensive use - worn daily under clothes for hours each day and for months in total to see any benefit at all. if you have an extremely small erect penis (say an inch or two) then some doctors may recommend surgery if it's important to you but most often doctors and therapists suggest becoming good at sex in other ways (e. g. oral sex finger stimulation being an emotionally exciting or available lover). some women prefer to be with a man who has an average size penis (5-6 inches) or smaller penis particularly if they experience genital pain or don't lubricate well or have a smaller than average vagina. bigger is definitely not always considered to be \"better. \" if you have questions about enlargement or penis size or health please check in with a urologist. yes fortunately after years of study it is medically proven that the penis grows after undergoing a treatment with a penis extender such as andropenis ( manufactured by andromedical) the treatment requites time and patience then after 6-8 months the patient can expect a growth up to 3-4 cm if used accordingly. andropenis by andromedical is approved by the european health authorities and it is manufactured according to the highest quality procedures. it is an simple treatment with excellent results. also andromedical offers a customer and patient support if necessary to help them with the treatment doubts. the product has a 60 day money back warranty in case the pàtient is not satisfied with it. sadly no. the only thing i have heard that kinda works is a penis pump. but these things are pretty rough on the skin down there so make sure you use a penis skin moisturizer/ protector like man1 man oil. trust me. you will be happy that you used it. skin irritation down there is painful embarrassing and inconvenient. hope this helps."

    "Answer": "don’t give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that you’re not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesn’t have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult i’d still encourage you to continue to do what you can but i’d suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until you’re at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan."

    "Answer": "many years ago i volunteered to perform sports physicals at four local middle schools. i spent a lot of time in that nurse’s office and apparently so did many of the students. all day long it was a dance of complaints. since the nurse’s professional hands are often tied when it comes to treatment the most common disposition for a sick child is a trip home. next to tummy aches headaches were at the top of the whine list. when i think back to my own middle school days there were plenty of things that can lead to headaches. just being at school all day is a headache to some kids. fortunately for all of us most headaches are not brain tumors or aneurysms. in healthy active kids the most common type of headache that is seen is the classic muscle-tension headache. the brain itself does not feel pain but all of the sensitive nerves muscles and blood vessels of our head can certainly generate a doozie of a headache. don’t get me wrong; headaches can be hallmarks of something more serious but most of the time a random self-limiting headache is just that… a headache. headaches are in the body of the beholder. a medical provider cannot see a headache which makes this an ideal get-out-of-school reason. teenagers tend to be great actors and are able to give a command performance at will. some performances are so good they end up in my office. by the time i see them parents are worried about brain tumors meningitis and all types of horrible diagnoses. “on a one to 10 scale with 10 being the worst headache what number do you give your headache? ” if a comfortable-looking person tells me “nine ” and their mannerism looks more like a one or two i am suspicious. i will then inquire as to the frequency of headaches their location on the head factors that may bring on the headache and things the person does to make the headache better. the number of missed days from school is another important bit of information. “i think it’s a migraine. ” most people don’t have a clue what “migraine” really means but will frequently self-diagnose. most feel that the word “migraine” just indicates a bad headache. when i explain to them that a migraine is a certain type of vascular (blood vessel) headache that usually occurs on just one side of the head usually severe accompanied by nausea/vomiting and proceeded by an “aura” (a feeling that a headache is imminent such as blurry/wavy vision) they will usually admit they do not have these things. migraines tend to run in families and in women may be cyclic related to menstruation. among many other triggers hormonal contraceptives can also trigger migraines in some people. younger children do a lot behavioral modeling. they see a parent constantly complaining of headaches and they may get one too. headaches located at the back of the neck or upper shoulders radiating to the scalp and feeling like your head is in a vise are usually muscle tension headaches. these can be due to sleeping on several thick pillows (flexing the neck) or sitting like a slug in those uncomfortable school desks. nervous tension like algebra tests or the day they need to run a mile in physical education all can create tension headaches. on examination i can usually find a very sore area (trigger point) around the nape of the neck and of course no clinical findings suggestive of brain tumors. parents are relieved; students not so much. sorting out real headaches from just headache complaints used to avoid something requires a lot of skill and experience. kids will get headaches when they are worried. tension at home like parents arguing or families going through a divorce will trigger headaches in kids. a physically or emotionally abusive parent will trigger headaches. bullying at school is another factor. when children are being teased or intimidated by other classmates they may use headaches as an excuse to go home. teachers can be bullies too. when i recall my elementary and middle school days there were some very unfriendly teachers in my life. teachers should always be respected but never feared. in dissecting factors that may be triggering a headache overly demanding (mean) teachers are often high on that list. rather than just prescribe tylenol or motrin it behooves the clinician and the parent to get more information. real headaches exist. serious headaches exist. even those pseudo-headaches deserve our utmost attention."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this and it's good of you to be concerned for the health and safety of others in your household. yes as you know handwashing is key to preventing the spread of gastroenteritis. equally important is knowing when to wash. always wash: after you've gone to the bathroom before you prepare any foods (even if it's only for your own consumption) use proper handwashing technique which consists of: start warm water running get your hands wet apply antibacterial soap work up a good lather all the way to your wrist rinse thoroughly (this is absolutely key ) dry thoroughly hold a towel or paper towel to turn off the water faucet also everyone in your household should be performing frequent handwashing not just you. other ways to help protect your family members: if possible don't prepare any food for the others in your household. don't share utensils (spoon fork) towels toothbrushes the tv remote control or anything you touch without disinfecting it first. keep food preparation areas as clean as possible. you can use disinfecting wipes from the store to keep surfaces germ-free. best of luck to you!"

    "Answer": "an ear infection will not cause your throat to be red but it can cause lymph nodes to swell. an irritated throat can cause lymph nodes to swell. the commonality of both ear pain and a red throat at the same time could be a virus or bacteria. since your doctor may not know this answer even after an exam many will just put you on an antibiotic. some will rely on the results of a strep screen to make that determination. your dizziness may be related to your ear pressure/infection."

    "Question": "what is hair loss?",
    "Answer": "there are many types of hair loss also called alopecia: gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. more and more hair follicles go into a telogen or resting phase and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. androgenic alopecia is another form of hair loss. it's a genetically predisposed condition that can affect both men and women. men with this condition can begin suffering hair loss as early as their teens or early 20s while most women don't experience noticeable thinning until their 40s or later. in men the condition is also called male pattern baldness. it's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown. in women androgenic alopecia is referred to as female pattern baldness. women with the condition experience a general thinning over the entire scalp with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. patchy hair loss in children and young adults often sudden in onset is known as alopecia areata. this condition may result in complete baldness but in about 90% of cases the hair returns usually within a few years. with alopecia universalis all body hair falls out. tearing out one's own hair a psychological disorder known as trichotillomania is seen most frequently in children. telogen effluvium is hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time causing shedding and subsequent thinning."

    "Question": "48 year old female walks outside everyday for 7 hours at my job. can't lose weight. what is a good diet plan?",
    "Answer": "everyone can lose weight it is just that you have mis-matched strategies. walking on the job is good but it is no substitute for calorie restrictions. the best diet is one that you will do -- a combination of balanced calorie restriction and even more exercise that just working. each pound of fat has 3 500 calories so if you will just reduce the amount you are eating by 500 calories a day. every day. and stick to it you will lose about a pound a week. that may sound slow but that is over 50 pounds a year. buy a good calorie book and add them up. weight loss comes down to simple math: if you take in less than your body needs to maintain or gain weight you will lose weight. perhaps not every day but at the end of a month you should be down four pounds and another four pounds down the next month. lose it slow learn new ways of eating give up the \"bad things\" (you know what they are) and set reasonable achievable weight loss goals. that's all you need to do."

    "Answer": "a medically induced coma is when a patient receives a controlled dose of an anesthetic typically propofol pentobarbital or thiopental to cause a temporary coma or a deep state of unconsciousness. this type of coma is used to protect the brain from swelling by reducing the metabolic rate of brain tissue as well as the cerebral blood flow. throughout a medically induced coma a patient’s critical life functions are constantly monitored by an anesthesiologist or other physician in a critical care setting only."

    "Question": "how are vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia treated?",
    "Answer": "for vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia the treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. if your body stores are depleted of vitamin b-12 your doctor will most likely prescribe vitamin b-12 injections and may also recommend high doses of b-12 supplements or a b-12 nasal spray. there is a good chance that many of the symptoms of deficiency will improve once the body is provided with the needed b-12. most people with vitamin b-12 deficiency have a permanent inability to absorb vitamin b-12 and will need injections every one to three months or pills daily for the rest of their lives. some forms of gastric bypass surgery are associated with deficiencies of iron vitamin b12 and other nutrients typically absorbed in the part of the stomach that is bypassed. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of vitamin b-12 in your diet. good dietary sources of vitamin b-12 are meat liver and kidney; fish oysters and clams; and milk cheese and eggs. if you have a folate deficiency your doctor will prescribe folate supplements and may recommend you increase the amount of folate in your diet. good dietary sources of folate include fresh fruits green leafy vegetables cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower broccoli and brussel sprouts) liver and kidney dairy products and whole grain cereals. vegetables should be eaten raw or lightly cooked."

    "Question": "how does crohn's disease affect the intestines?",
    "Answer": "in the early stages crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) on the inner surface of the bowel. these erosions are called aphthous ulcers. with time the erosions become deeper and larger ultimately becoming true ulcers (which are deeper than erosions) and causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel. as the disease progresses the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed and ultimately can become obstructed. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the wall of the bowel and bacteria from within the bowel can spread to infect adjacent organs and the surrounding abdominal cavity. when crohn's disease narrows the small intestine to the point of obstruction the flow of the contents through the intestine ceases. sometimes the obstruction can be caused suddenly by poorly digestible fruit or vegetables that plug the already narrowed segment of the intestine. when the intestine is obstructed digesting food fluid and gas from the stomach and the small intestine cannot pass into the colon. the symptoms of small intestinal obstruction then appear including severe abdominal cramps nausea vomiting and abdominal distention. obstruction of the small intestine is much more likely since the small intestine is much narrower than the colon to begin with. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the walls of the small intestine and the colon and create a tunnel between the intestine and adjacent organs. if the ulcer tunnel reaches an adjacent empty space inside the abdominal cavity a collection of infected pus (an abdominal abscess) is formed. patients with abdominal abscesses can develop tender abdominal masses high fevers and abdominal pain. when the ulcer tunnels into an adjacent organ a channel (fistula) is formed. the formation of a fistula between the intestine and the bladder (enteric-vesicular fistula) can cause frequent urinary tract infections and the passage of gas and feces during urination. when a fistula develops between the intestine and the skin (enteric-cutaneous fistula) pus and mucous emerge from a small painful opening on the skin of the abdomen. the development of a fistula between the colon and the vagina (colonic-vaginal fistula) causes gas and feces to emerge through the vagina. the presence of a fistula from the intestines to the anus (anal fistula) leads to a discharge of mucous and pus from the fistula's opening around the anus."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear your granddaughter's going through this especially at such a young age. i'm obviously not a doctor but the first thing that comes to my mind when you describe your granddaughter's symptoms is gastroparesis. in this condition a person's stomach does not empty as quickly as it's supposed to. even though gastroparesis is not common i've known several people with the condition. all of them said they experienced pain in the upper-right quadrant and all of them were frustrated that physicians told them pain is not a symptom of gastroparesis. in my opinion gastroparesis is not well-understood by most physicians. if your granddaughter ultimately is diagnosed with this condition i suggest you find a specialist to help her. she will need someone with deep knowledge of this unusual condition in order to help her learn how to meet her nutritional needs with a stomach that chronically malfunctions. note i'm not attempting to diagnose your granddaughter with gastroparesis. i'm only saying this is one possibility of what's going on based on the information you provided. it may be worth checking into this possibility more -- or at least getting it ruled out. wishing you (and your granddaughter) well! you might check for shingles. i know you are only 18 but i know several young people that have had it. in some cases you have the pain before you see any rash or blisters. i was one of those which made it hard to diagnose. others have the rash or blisters then the pain. it's something to check out. your pain is in the same area my was and it lasted for like a month."

    "Question": "what can i expect after heart surgery?",
    "Answer": "every time i do rounds in the cardiac surgery recovery unit i am amazed. room after room of people who just a few hours previously had their ribs split their heart exposed to the circulating air of the operating room and a human being’s hands replacing a heart valve or sewing healthy grafts on diseased coronary arteries. and there they lay with tubes drips and ventilators monitoring their every movement and supporting every breath. even the ones who are awake are groggy and it’s not surprising when they fall asleep while i’m talking or drift off in the middle of a sentence. this is heart surgery after all. it’s the medical equivalent of being hit by a truck. it’s a hard thing to grasp when you are signing a consent form but sometimes being hit by a truck is worth it. every day thousands of people’s hearts see more blood flow and oxygen from new blood vessels and valve replacement -- or repair -- fixes drafts and leaks and enables blood to travel where it needs to without being blocked by an obstruction. while we are able to do a lot of things these days without surgery the or still plays a very important role in extending life and improving its quality. one of the greatest concerns people have is post-operative recovery. while it is easier to quantify and estimate the risks related to surgery (or any invasive procedure for that matter) it’s the time afterward that can be more difficult to predict. for a day or two after surgery most people experience significant fatigue but typically this period is self-limited and once the body really starts to heal the progression is miraculous. patients stroll around the wards days after surgery with chest tubes catheters and invasive monitors just a memory from the intensive care unit. we typically discharge cardiac surgery patients on post-operative day five – it’s a testament to just how resilient the human body can be. but in all fairness the real recovery then begins at home. we recommend that patients try to walk for twenty or thirty minutes each day to help regain strength as well as improve lung function after surgery. it’s not uncommon for people to feel fatigue for several weeks or even a month or two after surgery. we arrange for a follow-up visit with our cardiologists as well as the heart surgeon to touch base a few weeks after surgery examine the incision site to make sure that everything is healing well and to adjust any medications if necessary. if you are going to have heart surgery you definitely have questions – here are a few to help frame the discussion with your surgeon and cardiologist: * how many of these types of procedures have you done? * how would you estimate my risk of a complication as compared to other patients? * what type of valve replacement or repair do you recommend and why? * where do you plan to obtain grafts (legs arms chest wall) for my bypass operation? * how soon can i travel after my surgery? * when do you anticipate that i can go back to work after surgery? * do you recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program or physical therapy to help speed up my recovery? it’s a long road and not without its frustrations and challenges along the way. but it takes people where they want to be – and where they need to be in many cases. the surgeon and cardiologist are only part of the process – in my opinion the majority of the healing lies within the patients themselves."

    "Answer": "in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsively/partake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it. but it is no excuse to lie/cheat/steal. there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc. call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure he/she would be a good help. bipolar disorder is about moods. lying cheating stealing is about their character. she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one."

    "Question": "i had a dtap in 2011 and i stepped on a nail today. do i need to get a tetanus shot? . im 16",
    "Answer": "the good news is: probably not. the dtap vaccine (which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis) is considered protective for 10 years. we recommend everyone get re-vaccinated with dtap every decade. that said the only way to tell for sure you're protected (because not all vaccines \"take\" the way they're supposed to) is to look at your blood antibodies. if your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then you're golden. bottom line: your best bet is to consult a health care provider. even if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems. better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "could the amoxicillin my nephew just finished taking cause a rash all over his body?",
    "Answer": "your nephew had a common reaction to amoxicillin. i see it a few times a month in my practice. this is not an allergic reaction but merely an innocent side effect that usually happens toward the end of the amoxicillin course. the rash will most likely fade in a few days. since he did have this reaction it would be best that he not take amoxcillin or similar penicillin drugs in the future."

    "Answer": "please do not ever try to induce labor on your own. this can be very dangerous for both the mother and the baby. if you are pregnant please seek medical attention immediately. every woman should receive medical care and guidance throughout her pregnancy in order to ensure the health and safety of her baby and herself. if you cannot afford care please call your local medicaid (in the u. s. ) office for assistance. i do not know if castor oil will induce labor or not. if you are in crisis over pregnancy please call a local crisis hotline women's resource center or your local hospital. they can direct you to resources to help you cope with whatever is going on. best wishes to you."

    "Question": "what type of seizure last for about 16 to 20 minutes?",
    "Answer": "well let me start by noting that not all body shaking is caused by a seizure. seizures are caused by abnormal brain signals while other types of involuntary body movement such as tremors may be hereditary and of unknown origin. there also are different types of seizures. some of them involve mild to severe convulsions but some of them merely cause a person to sort of stare off into space for awhile as if they can't hear you. seizures rarely (dare i say \"never\") last up to 20 minutes. most seizures last just a few minutes maybe 3 to 5 minutes or so before they end. if you believe you've had a seizure you should see a doctor for further examination and assessment. it's important to do this because a seizure can be a symptom of another underlying health problem such as in infection. i hope this helps! it is because i am a survivor of one. i have epilepsy from several head injuries and in 2012 minutes after surgery for a lumbar laminectomy i had a documented +30 minute seizure which ended with having a 4 day stay in icu along with scaring a surgeon and a anesthesiologist. even with all the precautions a 6 hour stay ended up with a 4 day camping trip at one of my least favorite places. luckily i don't remember anything except for the usual aura headaches and tiredness after each seizure. what saved my life was communication asking questions and family and doctor support. meds i take: keppra and depakote."

    "Question": "why are neighborhood medical spas “buyer beware”?",
    "Answer": "medical spas buyer beware because a medical spa implies that there’s some medical treatments. often there’s a staff physician or a nurse as opposed to just a traditional day spa. and so yes there are procedures that are offered. the question is whether that’s the best environment for that. why would it not be? well it depends on how much on site supervision there is by a physician and what is the physician’s specialty because by routine typically there is a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon available and sometimes on site but for some spas the so called medical director could be a pediatrician it could be a heart surgeon participating in a business enterprise. you just need to know that you have to have a license to be a medical director but the question is what specialty is that licensed doctor carry? how can a pediatrician or a heart surgeon actually do cosmetic procedures? that doesn’t even make sense well they are really not doing the procedures in some of the spas and i’m not saying that this is the rule but there are some that we know about. they don’t do them. they are really done by often very experienced and sophisticated nurse practitioners who specialize in that type of work. but there are some medical issues that can come up particularly suitability. should one have such and such a procedure? a given skin peel or the injections because not everyone is a candidate for these things. it’s not like shopping at a supermarket where you just take something off the shelf. there has to be some consideration for the right substance the right treatment and for the right skin and the right type of person in respect to their health. so that’s where the system breaks down if in fact the supervising doctor hasn’t been raised in the world of cosmetic surgery. and are most of them raised in the world of cosmetic surgery? dr. kotler: most most are raised in the cosmetic surgery world but not all and we do hear stories about physicians kind of migrating in to the medical spa because it’s uhm it’s a business it’s an investment opportunity or often the spa may be owned by business men and they’ve appointed dr. x to be the quote medical director. but it’s good to have a sense of who’s at the controls. who’s responsible and who will be there if there’s a problem. 15 all medical treatments have some potential for you know delayed healing some minor complications. who is going to be the backup? now let’s say that there are doctors on hand. are those necessarily well trained doctors? that can vary. typically you see in a spa the doctor wouldn’t be there all the time because he has to spend most of his time in the office or in the operating room. so again it depends but i think it’s a great question for someone considering a medical treatment and i’m not talking about a non medical treatment we’re not talking pedicures here but if someone’s considering having a botox injection or restylane or any type of skin peel any type of rejuvenative procedure done by a physician or a nurse you need to know what is that doctor’s background. is he or she really an expert or has the doctor kind of migrated into this field for whatever reason."

    "Answer": "in addition to what the other contributor said it's possible that you are pregnant and the hormone is not yet strong enough to show up on the test. i went through the same thing when i was pregnant with my second child. the hcg hormone wasn't strong enough to show up until i was already 4 or 5 weeks late. another thing to consider is is you have always been irregular then pcos is a possibility too. if i were you i'd consult with an ob/gyn soon. at least that way you can get some real answers and maybe some stress relief."

    "Answer": "i'm very sorry you're dealing with this especially at such a young age. unfortunately there's no good answer to your question. the course of multiple myeloma is different for every person. some people live many years with few symptoms. other people have rapidly progressive disease that takes their life fairly quickly. my concern for you is twofold. first why don't you want to treat this condition when you're just 25 years old? you have your whole life ahead of you. i could understand a 70-year-old declining treatment. but a young man? this puzzles me. second your doctor should be more responsive. he or she doesn't have the right to withhold information from you merely because you are choosing to decline treatment. i'd strongly suggest you get a second opinion or switch health care providers. you deserve a doctor who's willing to partner with you in terms of assessing the form and severity of your disease. please assemble a supportive team of family and friends to help you make decisions as you go forward. i'm not suggesting you're incapable of making your own decisions. it's just always good to have input from caring intelligent people who have your best interest at heart. i wish you all the best as you navigate the course of this disease. in 1967 nine months before multiple myeloma was \"active \" the doctor found the disease in my father's blood stream (work). he was 56 years old. 1 1/2 yr later he died. the cytoxin chemo was ineffective. the only successful relief occurred during radiation from which he suffered pneumonia. new drugs and especially stem cell theraphy were not yet discovered. my father suffered although silently. he lost bone off his spine as he became shorter. in the final hospitalization the family was told that although he was given blood transfusions the blood would clot and could not circulate and therefore he died. my father was a college professor who taught in an old navy duplex wooden lined. it was often sprayed for insects. twenty years later the multiple myeloma occurred. five years after this the professor who taught in the room across from my father died of multiple myeloma also."

    "Answer": "fsas are offered as an individual employee benefit so each member of a married couple can have his or her own fsa account assuming one is available to each separately at work. fsas allow employees to set aside salary tax-free to pay for health-care expenses not covered by insurance for themselves and their dependents. that includes deductibles co-pays and co-insurance for medical and dental care. fsa limits as of today there's no maximum contribution set for health fsas; it's left up to your employer to set one and many employers do establish a maximum says anne waidmann a director of human resource services for price waterhouse cooper. a $5 000 cap on contributions is most common. that means you and your spouse may currently be able to contribute $5 000 each for a total of $10 000. but health reform will usher in some changes for these tax-free accounts. starting in 2013 for example the maximum contribution an employee can make to an fsa will be $2 500. \"if an employee and spouse are both employed and earn more than $2 500 each they can each contribute that amount to their fsas for a total of $5 000 \" waidmann says. until that change takes effect however check with your employer to find out what the maximum contribution is for 2011 and 2012. . for a list of medical expenses covered by an fsa you can check the irs's website."

    "Answer": "zonisamide lyrica and celexa have a similar side effect of increased dizziness and drowsiness. combining all three of these medications can increase the intensity of their side effects. driving and doing activities that require cognitive function may be more difficult than usual. the side effects may subside with time. maxalt is a triptan medication for symptomatic relief of the migraine. celexa works on serotonin receptors just as maxalt can. the increased combination of both these products may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition. symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability altered consciousness confusion hallucinations and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia hyperthermia diaphoresis shivering blood pressure lability and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia myoclonus tremor rigidity and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping nausea vomiting and diarrhea. because of these side effects i would monitor how frequently the migraines occur and how often you are taking the maxalt. if you are taking the maxalt more than twice a week then you may need to start taking a preventative medication. monitor all your side effects if you have any and make sure to partner with your pharmacist or health care professional regarding any concerns or discomfort."

    "Answer": "normal 0 false false false en-ca x-none x-none microsoftinternetexplorer4 its from my understanding (and i am not a doctor or anything close) that there is a lot of bacteria in your mouth. some people due to cultural social or bacterial reasons will have different types of bacteria in their mouth as you ones that you've never encountered before. so when you kiss you probably french kiss and when you do you exchange those germs in turn effect your throat and give you a bacterial infection. cavities plaque on your teeth are all caused by bacteria eating and growing on the food particles left in your mouth after you eat. possible solution: you can try using mouthwash afterwards and try to kill the bacteria that enter your own mouth or if your close enough to your partner both use mouth wash before making out. if you live with them you can try to convince them the increase their oral hygiene. in theory you'll eventually build up an immunity to his standard regime of germs in his mouth. you're probably as sensitive as i am! (this used to happen to me all the time with a previous partner but since i've become older i don't have the problem. but my current partner is better at oral hygiene) also you can talk to your doctor about things that you can do to prevent this. obviously no longer kissing is going to be a solution but i doubt that will happen. if it becomes a serious issue and it doesnt go away within 3 days go to a doctor and tell them the possible origin! as some one else pointed out there are also sti's that can cause oral infections ones that are transferred from genitals to/from your mouth/throat. if you're getting seriously sick you need to consider that possibility that they need to be checked out. he may be a carrier or host. but that needs to be discussed with a doctor as well."

    "Answer": "kudos to you for recognizing it is not safe to take pravastatin (or any cholesterol-lowering medication) while pregnant! obviously you should discuss your pravastatin use and your desire to conceive with your health care provider. in general pravastatin has a short half-life of about two hours which means about two hours after you take it only half the dose is still circulating in your blood. if you completely discontinue pravastatin it will gradually leave your bloodstream altogether. there's no way to tell when the drug has completely left your system and every individual's body eliminates drugs at a different rate so your best bet is to have a discussion with your health care provider to see how long you should wait before trying to conceive. best wishes on this exciting time in your life!"

    "Answer": "as long as you are a non-smoker and in good health (not significantly hypertensive not a significant diabetic etc. ) you can take the pill. of course you want to be on a low-dose pill -- most women can do well with a pill that has 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or lower. so if your pill says that it has 50 micrograms of estrogen check with your health-care provider about switching to a lower dose if possible. remember women can get pregnant in their 40's -- i personally have delivered three women who were 47."

    "Answer": "you need to find out what this \"something\" really is so you need to see your medical provider or a proctologist for a proper examination. it could be an internal hemorrhoid but this would need to be confirmed. i could also be a rectal prolapse (part of your rectum coming out and going back in). incidentally hemorrhoid creams do not \"cure\" hemorrhoids they just reduce some inflammation. they are still there. you are having pain and you are getting worse according to your posting. at what point to you seek medical care? my advice would be for you to make an appointment."

    "Question": "is pubic hair removal dangerous or needed for hygiene? . some doctors claim this has lead to pubic lice becoming almost extinct without moist/warm habitat for lice and other infections which can be passed on as sti's so pubic hair removal is a benaficial thing. on the other hand doctors claim that when the hair is removed it leaves a 'microscopic open wound' which can also lead to infections and std's also skin irritations and can be equally dangerous. so which is true and is pubic hair removal a good or dangerous thing to do?",
    "Answer": "the removal of pubic hair is not medically-beneficial in any way nor does it protect you from pubic lice. the removal of pubic hair is only a cosmetic fad. i don't know about the lice or stds but i know i feel cleaner by shaving. i also used to get a fair amount of yeast infections when i was younger and didn't shave. and i'm happy to say that in the 30 yrs since i've been shaving i haven't had even one infection. that tells me i've removed the moist warm \"habitat\" for some infections. and my ob-gyn agrees with me on that. plus everything is better all the way around. hi the doc says its a fad some fad i personally have been shaved for way over 50 years my wife since we were married in 1970. i do love the feeling of being clean so dose my wife. doctors in the uk see lots of clean shaven women but there not sure if they do this when they come in to be seen or there like it all the time. but i think your find there is a whole lot of us who are true smoothies and love being that way its just so nice to be clean. you have to remember there are a lot of people who do love to be that extra bit clean and shaving dose that and really good when it comes to sex. smoothies unit. good luck"

    "Answer": "polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) is a very complicated disorder in that it can cause many different problems. one of the things that we worry about the most is insulin resistance (similar to diabetes) which needs to be treated. another is not having a regular menstrual cycle which can lead to abnormal cells developing inside the uterus. other problems include acne high cholesterol heavy hair growth in abnormal areas and infertility. sometimes pcos will resolve with time or with weight loss but for some it is lifelong. typically it is treated with oral contraceptives to regulate your hormones and periods and/or metformin to help with the insulin resistance. it is very important for you to follow-up with your gynecologist for treatment and monitoring."

    "Answer": "the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if you’re drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones -- the most common type -- eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones."

    "Answer": "visit your health care provider to get your numbers for the good cholesterol (hdl) and the bad (ldl). keeping track of these numbers is important for managing risk factors for heart disease. if your physician tells you that your ldl is too high there are several dietary changes you can make to lower that number. you may have heard that eating oatmeal is healthy for good cholesterol. this is because the soluble fiber found in oatmeal can grab onto dietary cholesterol in your body and remove it through waste elimination. other foods that contain soluble fibers include apples okra and just about all other fruits and vegetables. eating more fish can help too. the usda's myplate. gov dietary recommendations advise us all to eat at least two servings of fish per week. fatty fish such as salmon sardines and tuna are especially good sources of the fish oils that are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. and not only can they help lower ldl levels but they actually help increase hdl levels. lastly be sure to avoid foods that are high in saturated fats which can raise ldl levels. these include cream butter fatty meats and whole milk. fish and fiber"

    "Answer": "an upset stomach is one of the most common discomforts during pregnancy. nausea is a result of hormonal changes and most often occurs early in pregnancy until your body adjusts to the increased production of hormones. nausea can begin in early pregnancy but is usually gone by the fourth month. it can occur at any time of the day but may be worse in the morning when your stomach is empty (this is often called \"morning sickness\") or if you are not eating enough. recommendations: if nausea is a problem in the morning eat dry foods like cereal toast or crackers before getting out of bed. or try eating a high-protein snack such as lean meat or cheese before going to bed (protein takes longer to digest). eat small meals or snacks every two to three hours rather than three large meals. eat slowly and chew your food completely. sip on fluids throughout the day. avoid large amounts of fluids at one time. try cool clear fruit juices such as apple or grape juice. avoid spicy fried or greasy foods. if you are bothered by strong smells eat foods cold or at room temperature and avoid odors that bother you. talk to your doctor about taking vitamin b6 or other treatments. contact your health care provider if your vomiting is constant or so severe that you can't keep fluids or foods down. this can cause dehydration and should be treated right away."

    "Answer": "i am not sure what type of std you are referring to but you and your partner had previous partners then this is the source. not all people are totally honest about their past sexual experiences. how does the std get started if both partners have only been with each other and no one else? is it a virus that mutates into an std then infects a person?"

    "Question": "can varicose veins form a blood clot which can esentially cause a stroke? . i am a 52 year old female with varicose veins for approximately 20 years.",
    "Answer": "many people wonder if varicose veins can be a source of blood clots. the answer is \"not exactly. \" when people talk about \"blood clots \" they typically mean deep venous thromboses (dvt). these dangerous clots form in the deep tissue (typically of the calf muscle in the lower leg) and can break free and travel to the lungs causing a life-threatening pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). varicose veins generally aren't linked to dvts. why is this so? well it's because varicose veins generally form in the superficial tissue not the deep tissue. as you can see by looking at your own legs those gnarled varicose veins reside near the surface of the skin. by definition these are not \"deep\" veins. because varicose veins are flabby blood can indeed pool in them and probably clot up. however this becomes a problem of the local tissue. these clots generally don't travel anywhere else in the body. varicose veins usually are considered a cosmetic problem even though they can cause pain and feelings of heaviness in the legs. varicose veins can run in families. if your leg veins are bothering you consult a physician who specializes in treating this problem. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "is contact with a person with shingles harmful to pregnant women?",
    "Answer": "that would depend on the type of contact. shingles (herpes zoster) is a contagious virus by direct contact. many people with active shingles have them on the chest or trunk covered by clothing. in this situation a direct contact with the herpetic lesions would be unlikely. if the person with shingles had them on the face then a face to face contact can certainly spread the virus to any susceptible person pregnant or not. just being in the same room is fine because shingles is not transmitted through the air. herpes in pregnancy is dangerous and is something that must be avoided so it is always best to limit contact of any pregnant woman with any person with active shingles or other herpetic lesions."

    "Question": "why do teens need at least eight hours of sleep?",
    "Answer": "does your teen get fewer than eight hours? if so listen up: your teen is more at risk for obesity and all the health problems connected to that (high blood pressure heart disease stroke etc. ). the link between sleep deprivation and a higher risk for obesity and related cardiovascular problems may not seem obvious. but here’s the key: when you’re sleep deprived (and yes for the vast majority of teens fewer than eight hours on a regular basis qualifies as being sleep deprived) you’ll crave high carbohydrate foods — especially those that are loaded with fat salt and sugar. i know it’s not fair to crave junk food when we’re already lacking in the sleep department but you can blame our ancient dna on this fact. encoded in our genes are signals to eat like this when we’re tired. hormones that control our signals of hunger and conversely fullness get thrown out of whack when we are sleep deprived. in a new study published this month in the journal sleep researchers determined that teens can’t escape this hard-wired reality that adults are saddled with. though plenty of studies in recent years have implicated obesity with sleep deprivation in adults not many have been performed on younger generations to find similar associations. in this latest study researchers found sleep-deprived teens: * consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fat. * ate more snacks than those who slept eight hours or more a night. * ate more total calories. and you know what that spells: weight gain. when we think of adolescents losing out on sleep our minds quickly turn to potential accidents and an inability to concentrate or perform well in school. studies like this highlight the health consequences of sleep deprivation. the health repercussions of sleep deprivation at this “tender” age may actually be worse than those of an adult. for starters teens are establishing habits they will keep for a lifetime. a teen who gets used to eating poorly and packing on the pounds will likely grow into an overweight adult when it’ll be that much harder to change those habits and lose the excess weight. the more fatty foods you eat the more you crave them. secondly we’re only beginning to understand the biomechanics of a developing person’s metabolism. do teens who begin to have metabolic disturbances early in life suffer from a lifetime of irreversible higher health risks? it wouldn’t surprise me. and those higher risks may go far beyond just obesity and cardiovascular challenges. they may in fact go as far as upping the risk for cancer. so thirdly it’s a foregone conclusion: teens need their sleep as much as adults do."

    "Answer": "when you say can't keep food down i'm not sure if it is forceful vomiting or frequent spit up. gastro-esophageal reflux (ger when food comes back up is common in babies occurring in half of babies under 6 months old. some are referred to as \"happy spitters\" meaning they frequently regurgitate (2 or more times per day) but are growing and eating without other issues. but if it gets worse with time or is more projectile or is accompanied by other symptoms (wheezing gagging etc. ) and there is poor growth it's a problem. gastro-esophageal reflux disease (gerd) is ger coupled with problematic symptoms and needs a doctor's attention. if you suspect your child has gerd or some other problem see your doctor again. for more on gerd see this webmd article. you also might want to see a lactation consutant for tips on breastfeeding positions and feeding techniques (like pumping before feeds) to decrease spitting up after feeding. good luck!"

    "Answer": "establishing a good relationship with your doctor is perhaps one of the best things you can do for your health. it’s important to routinely visit a doctor because some diseases and conditions won’t present with outward warning signs or symptoms; so the only way to know your risk is to get checked out or tested. it’s essential that you find a doctor that you can trust and who embodies a similar philosophy regarding health as you. do proper research beforehand. ask friends or coworkers who they would recommend call your insurance company for their guidance or visit the webmd physician finder (found here: <link> ) that you can use to find doctors near you. the webmd site allow you to pull up a profile of each doctor where it displays information like their education and training to help you make a more informed decision. narrow your decision to a few potential candidates and then try doing internet searches for them to see if you can find reviews that people have written based on their experiences with that doctor. make sure they’re in your network if you have insurance as well. perhaps a good way to get over your distrust of doctors is to play a more active role in your health. ask questions so that you’re well informed of what your doctor is doing or why your doctor recommends something. remember it’s your health and you always have the right to refuse anything if you don’t feel comfortable or don’t fully understand the reasoning behind it. ask your doctor to allow you time to do more research before making any big decisions as well. don’t worry if you’re still not happy after visiting your doctor or your experience didn’t go well; you can always try to find another doctor that better meets your needs. i share y our concern! guidelines? try to find someone who will recommend one. older docs are best. pick a female next. doctors seem to be ignorant of the latest medical advances. when asked about a certain procedure that is less invasive they immediately want you to agree have the outdated procedure that they are familiar. they will not listen to your concerns. no answers to your question about the latest in office procedures that are equivalent. they have another patient waiting. one p. a twice suggested i medicate myself. re:-- a sore that would not heal. i used triple antibiotic with no results. he suggested that i should go home and try use bacitracin. . 3 days no improvement. finally i washed the area with dyna hex 4. sore healed and was gone in 2 days. at the followup i told him what i did to heal myself. his response was what ever works! another specialist wanted to remove my friends gall bladder even tho there were no stones seen only some shadows? gall bladder not needed. operation refused. do not expect much help at a walk in clinic. i went to one and waited 3 hours then i left an ent i went to for a sinus problem diagnosis sinus infection. after 3 days of dosing i had a reaction and went to the emergency room with chest pressure and low oxy levels. out in 2 days. medicare paid for everything! good luck p. s. even this site has no info on tmao testing or dmg use google them."

    "Question": "what are the risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "reasons that a pregnancy may be considered high risk include: maternal age. one of the most common risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy is the age of the mother-to-be. women who will be under 17 or over 35 when their baby is due are at greater risk of complications than those between their late teens and early 30s. the risk of miscarriage and genetic defects further increases after age 40. medical conditions that exist before pregnancy. conditions such as high blood pressure; breathing kidney or heart problems; diabetes; autoimmune disease; sexually transmitted diseases (stds); or chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can present risks for the mother and/or her unborn baby. a history of miscarriage problems with a previous pregnancy or pregnancies or a family history of genetic disorders are also risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy. if you have a medical condition it's important to consult your doctor before you decide to become pregnant. your doctor may run tests adjust medications or advise you of precautions you need to take to optimize the health of you and your baby. medical conditions that occur during pregnancy. even if you are healthy when you become pregnant it is possible to develop or be diagnosed with problems during pregnancy that can affect you and your baby. two of the more common pregnancy-related problems are: preeclampsia is a syndrome that includes high blood pressure urinary protein and swelling; it can be fatal for the mother and/or baby if not treated. with proper treatment however many women who develop preeclampsia have healthy babies. gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. women with gestational diabetes may have healthy pregnancies and babies if they follow the treatment plan from their health-care provider. usually the diabetes resolves after delivery. however women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. pregnancy-related issues. often a pregnancy is classified as high risk because of issues that arise from the pregnancy itself and that have little to do with the mother's health. these include: premature labor is labor that begins before the 37th week of pregnancy -- the point at which the baby is deemed full-term. although there is no way to know which women will experience preterm labor or birth there are factors that place women at higher risk such as certain infections a shortened cervix or previous preterm birth. multiple births means you are carrying more than one baby (twins triplets quadruplets etc. ). multiple pregnancies which are more common as women are using more infertility treatments increase the risk of premature labor gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix. the condition can cause bleeding especially if a woman has contractions. if the placenta still covers the cervix close to delivery the doctor may schedule a cesarean section to reduce bleeding risks to the mother and baby. fetal problems which can sometimes be seen on ultrasound. approximately 2% to 3% of all babies have a minor or major structural problem in development. sometimes there may be a family history of fetal problems but other times these problems are completely unexpected."

    "Question": "how is sepsis (blood poisoning) treated?",
    "Answer": "in almost every case of sepsis patients need to be hospitalized treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death. therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit of the hospital. appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time; most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many mrsa infections. however once the infecting organism is isolated labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient. in addition to antibiotics two other major therapeutic interventions organ-system support and surgery may be needed. first if an organ system needs support the intensive care unit can often provide it (for example intubation to support lung function or dialysis to support kidney function). secondly surgery may be needed to drain or remove the source of infection. amputation of extremities has been done to save some patients' lives."

    "Question": "can poison ivy rash return same place after 2 months? . rash returned same places on arms after 2 months since had first rash. . haven't been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy. any one ever hear of this happening?",
    "Answer": "poison ivy (or oak) is caused by exposure to the olioresin (oil) of the plant. it does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were re-exposed to the oil again. the oil can remain stable on an object for years so you don't have to come in contact with plant. just an object that still has the oil on it. please be sure you actually have poison ivy. many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place (like eczema shingles etc. ). so i see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can. and who is right? absolutely the people who say it can return are right. last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles. many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned. i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors. i was not working outdoors at all! moreover even now a year later though i don't have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return. currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck--unrelated to last year's episode. i have taken prednizone for a week (and never again will i take a stereoid! no wonder all those nfl players are killing people). i have washed all my clothes sheets etc. in hot water twice. the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back. but i have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks. the poison ivy--as someone else said--is surely in my system. i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant wouldn't look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so-called professionals. what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar. it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching. i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally. then i rub \"itch\" all over the now-dry area. there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs (hideous but effective) the scabs fall off fairly soon (so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall! ugh! gross! ). i've been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in--whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep. other \"treatments\"--vick's vapo-rub clorox (so good for your liver) cortizone creams and other over-the-counter meds have not done so well. haven't tried tobacco but i'm an x-smoker and if there's anything that makes me want to smoke it's lying awake all night scratching--so i had to forget that. a pox take the next creep who writes that \"the best treatment is avoidance. \" (i hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once. the plant is everywhere! ) i hope this helps some other poor sufferer! itchy-scratchy yes the rash can return to same area months later. once you have been exposed to this plant and even thought the rash itself may have long since healed or faded away the underlying skin proteins remain sensitized to urushiol for quite some time in some cases several years hence the slightest newest recent exposure to urushiol in certain individuals will cause you to experience for a second or third time a newer rash. breathing in the flower pollen also in certain individuals will cause them to develop a rash. exposure frequency and time interval duration between each successive pi exposure to a large extent will determine how severe your rash outbreak will not only be but how long it will last. \"it's in the blood\" is what i have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you. always thought that statement was crazy until 6 years ago i accidently got it on me. the rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when i have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly. tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible. usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out. the most horrid plant in the universe! i have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins. now over most of my body. after two 5 day treatments of 12 steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever (during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped). desperate now with itching awful looking skin. have left the gym (which had helped me lose 2 stone in 4 months). hate going as whether you are working out or swimming people quite naturally look at your skin. i am now to see a dermatologist on tuesday so can only hope something can be improved. best cooling lotions i have used for relief of itching have been aloe vera and (one i got in the us) called caladryl clear (topical analgesic skin protectant). coated in this after cold water or ice to skin seems to make me more comfortable. i got this in june and it is now nearly september. worst thing i have ever managed to get. deeply regret doing all that gardening now and still haven't found the pouson ivy."

    "Answer": "the prospect of bed rest may sound like a welcome reprieve from your busy life at first but if it lasts long you can feel isolated frustrated and bored. fortunately there are things you can do to make your days weeks or months of bed rest more pleasant and productive. stay on schedule. days and nights can easily run together if you spend both in bed. make it a point to maintain some type of schedule. get dressed in the morning. keep a to-do list and plan \"activities\" for the day such as calling a few friends scheduling a doctor's appointment or ordering baby items online. read up. catch up on reading -- something you won't likely have time for once the baby comes. good picks include parenting books magazines and web sites; baby name books; newspapers; magazines; novels; or even children's books that you may want to read to your little one later. catch some flicks. enjoy movies on tv online or from services that deliver dvds directly to your home. let people help. although you may find it difficult to ask for help you must. if a friend or family member asks how they may help offer specifics such as picking up items at the grocery store or taking your turn on the car pool until you're up and out again. keep a journal. keep a journal to vent (for your eyes only) or to document your pregnancy (possibly a gift to share with your child one day). better yet keep one of each type. catch up on correspondence. answer letters pay bills write thank-you notes for baby shower gifts or make a list of people (with names and email addresses) to contact when the baby is born. get online support. use the internet to find support from other mothers on bed rest. check out message boards and chat rooms for empathy and advice."

    "Question": "what are triggers for eczema and how can i treat itching and inflammation?",
    "Answer": "eczema is a catch-all term for inflamed itchy raw cracked and peeling skin. eczema is usually genetic – if one of your parents has it chances are you and your children will too. the list of triggers is very very long: -prolonged or hot baths since anything that dries the skin can set the inflammation process going. that includes hot tubs and saunas. -deodorant soaps perfumed soaps and body washes. - anything abrasive such as grainy body scrubs and even loofahs. - fragranced moisturizers or anything that contains lactic acid salicylic acid or glycolic acid. - wool clothes or elastics because the pressure point can start the itch/scratch cycle. - detergents and fabric softeners. - food allergies or sensitivities – the most common are eggs dairy corn grains yeast artificial sweeteners and soy. - airborne allergens such as dust and pollen - dry and heated environments. this is one reason why eczema is usually worse in winter. - cold windy weather. babies and children suffer the most from eczema and should be seen by a doctor promptly. for babies and small children the first step is washing with the mildest possible cleanser and making sure that baths are as quick as possible. then while the skin is still damp moisturize it with a heavy protective product. steroids are the very last resort for small children and i don’t like to use them at all in babies. some children are lucky enough to outgrow eczema usually by the age of five. others unfortunately will be lifelong sufferers. for adults antihistamines can help even the over-the-counter ones. topical steroids will calm the itch and reduce the inflammation but should be used with caution since prolonged use can thin the skin permanently. protopic and elidel are the big guns but not everybody tolerates them well and they have serious potential side effects. for people with eczema it is crucial to avoid triggers and otherwise take precautions every day. wear light comfortable clothing made from cotton silk or linen. bed linens should be 100% cotton or satin. when doing laundry use only hypoallergenic detergent put clothes through the rinse cycle twice to get rid of any trace of detergent and use tennis balls in the dryer instead of dryer sheets."

    "Question": "what does snoring have to do with metabolic syndrome?",
    "Answer": "metabolic syndrome is probably something you have seen or read about in the news lately. but you may not know exactly what it is or how to know if you have it. metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that has been linked to obesity and that can increase the risk for heart disease diabetes and stroke (it has also been labeled syndrome x and obesity syndrome). generally this situation does not have official symptoms however patients with metabolic syndrome may also have: * high blood sugar -- when diabetes is present: increased thirst increased urination. * high blood pressure. * fatigue. * blurred vision. * headache. so how would you know if you had metabolic syndrome? your doctor would take a clinical history and do some blood work. here is what they might find: 1. a large waistline (35+ inches for women; 40+ inches for men). 2. high triglycerides -- this is a type of fat found in the blood (150 mg/dl) or higher. 3. low hdl (less than 50 mg/dl for women and 40 mg/dl for men). 4. high blood pressure (anything above 135/85). 5. high fasting blood sugar (100+ mg/dl). about 85% of people with type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome. so what does metabolic syndrome have to do with sleep? in a study published in the december 1 2010 issue of the journal sleep researchers found that loud snoring and difficulty falling asleep and “un-refreshing” sleep may predict development of metabolic syndrome. this prospective study had 812 subjects who were free from metabolic syndrome or diabetes at baseline the beginning of the study and in just three years 14% of them had developed metabolic syndrome. two thirds of the study subjects were women and 36% were african american. while the statistics on predicting metabolic syndrome from the sleep characteristics in this study were low the study continues to remind us that every organ system and every disease state can be affected by lack of sleep. so if you snore loudly have difficulty falling asleep and wake up feeling “un-refreshed ” see your doctor."

    "Answer": "much like asthma causes inflammation in the lining of the airways sinusitis causes inflammation in the mucous membranes that line the sinuses. this inflammation causes the mucous membranes in the sinuses to secrete more mucus -- also similar to asthma. when the sinuses get inflamed the airways respond similarly in many people with asthma leading to sinusitis with asthma. prompt treatment of a sinus infection is often necessary to help relieve asthma symptoms."

    "Question": "what causes hives?",
    "Answer": "when an allergen invades or irritates your body it causes your body to unleash chemicals known as histamines. some people react to a high histamine level by developing the rash we call hives. common allergens that can provoke hives include certain milk products fish and nuts; drugs such as penicillin and aspirin; and various food additives emulsifiers flavorings and preservatives. extreme cold or heat stress and pressure on the skin may induce an attack of hives as can insect bites infections such as strep throat in children and hepatitis b in adults and -- in very rare cases -- blood transfusions."

    "Question": "what should my heart rate be during exercise?",
    "Answer": "calculate your target heart rate with a formula called the \"heart rate reserve\" method recommends richard weil med cde. use a watch with a second hand to keep track of how many times your heart beats per minute. you can feel your heartbeat at the underside of your wrist or along the side of your neck. here's how to use the formula: determine your maximum heart rate (mhr) by subtracting your age from 220. then subtract your resting heart rate (it's best to take this when you first wake up in the morning) from your maximum heart rate to find your heart rate reserve (hrr). multiply your hrr by the percentage of your mhr at which you wish to train (60% to 85% is the usual range for people looking to increase fitness and health). add your resting heart rate back to that result to get your target rate. so assuming an age of 27 a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute and a desired training range of 70% the calculation would look like this: 220 - 27 = 193 193 - 70 = 123 123 x. 70% = 86 86 + 70 = 156 remember this is an estimate not an absolute. also keep in mind that athletes may exceed the training zone and even the maximum heart rate during high-intensity training."

    "Question": "what can help anxiety caused by going to the gynecologist? . i have only been to the gynecologist once for examining purposes and it was very traumatic for me. i experienced a lot of pain during the exam to the point that the doctor had to stop. i felt very violated but i know i have to confront this fear and go back especially since i want to have children one day. how can this be dealt with? is this normal? i was thinking that maybe having my husband go with me next time would be helpful but i'm not sure.",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer having your husband or a trusted female friend would be great. talk to you women friends too. having someone with you will make you feel safer. t may not be the exam. but the examiner so consider getting a female nurse practitioner or pa or find a very kind and compassionate gynecologist. to many unfortunately this intimate exam is so routine. almost like a dentist looking in your mouth. that they may not take the time and care to do it gently. again ask your friends for a referral to someone they find to be helpful. your primary care medical provider can give you a short-acting anti-anxiety medication if you ask. something like xanax at a low-dose may be helpful. look deep inside yourself to see if there was a stressful event in the past that may be surfacing when you are having a gynecological exam. if so a counselor may be able to help you deal with this very specific anxiety."

    "Question": "how is paget's disease of the nipple treated?",
    "Answer": "surgery is the most common treatment for paget's disease of the nipple. the specific treatment often depends on the characteristics of the underlying breast cancer. a modified radical mastectomy may be recommended when invasive cancer or extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) has been diagnosed. in this operation the surgeon removes the breast the lining over the chest muscles and some of the lymph nodes under the arm. in cases where underlying breast cancer is not invasive the surgeon may perform a simple mastectomy to remove only the breast and the lining over the chest muscles. alternatively patients whose disease is confined to the nipple and the surrounding area may undergo breast-conserving surgery or lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy. during breast-conserving surgery the surgeon removes the nipple areola and the entire portion of the breast believed to contain the cancer. in most cases radiation therapy is also used to help prevent recurrence (return of the cancer). during surgery particularly modified radical mastectomy the doctor may perform an axillary node dissection to remove the lymph nodes under the arm. the lymph nodes are then examined to see if the cancer has spread to them. in some cases a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed to remove only one or a few lymph nodes. adjuvant treatment (treatment that is given in addition to surgery to prevent the cancer from coming back) may be part of the treatment plan depending on the type of cancer and whether cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes. radiation treatment is a common adjuvant therapy for paget's disease of the nipple following breast-conserving surgery. adjuvant treatment with anticancer drugs or hormone therapies may also be recommended depending on the extent of the disease and prognostic factors (estimated chance of recovery from the disease or chance that the disease will recur)."

    "Answer": "i would not agree that properly washed underwear would likely retain any fungus residuals. fungus can exist just about everywhere in the home - especially in warm dark or moist areas. finding the one source or sources may be difficult. have you seen a dermatologist? if not this would be recommended. have you tried using man1 man oil? it contains several antibacterial vitamins and nutrients that help with infection and other skin issues down there. simply rub it into your penis skin and let it do the work. it's all natural too so no side effects. you can get it online. hope this helps."

    "Question": "what does it mean when you exercise and sweat and then begin to itch?",
    "Answer": "this is quite common. it's most likely due to an allergic-like reaction during exercise. during exercise histamines are released and some people are sensitive to them. people sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but can be on the arms or neck too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (e. g. antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. if the problem is bothering you so much that you can't stand it and it doesn't go away during the exercise session (it may just pass if you continue) then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter anti-histamine (like benadryl) 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter anti-histamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedative anti-histamine. you should only take over-the-counter or prescription medication for this problem after speaking with your doctor."

    "Question": "which foods should i eat to prevent osteoporosis?",
    "Answer": "it's great that you are looking to do something about osteoporosis now. prevention is very important because even though there are many treatment options for those who have it there is no cure once you do. your diet plays a key role in this. the key areas to focus on are: calcium: this is a mineral that your body needs every day for many functions. calcium plays a role in maintaining the strength of your bones and teeth as well as the functioning of your heart nerves and blood clotting. unfortunately the majority of the population is not taking in the required daily amount of calcium. when this happens your body will use the supply that you have from your bones to support the other functions that it is needed for. for this reason it's imperative that you meet your daily requirements every day. dietary sources of calcium are: dairy products: milk yogurt cheese and calcium-fortified cottage cheese. green leafy vegetables: broccoli kale collard greens dried figs turnip greens and mustard greens. fish: canned salmon and sardines with the bones. nuts: almonds and brazil nuts. enriched foods: cereals orange juice beverages and breads that have calcium added to them. there are things in your diet that can interfere with how much calcium your body can absorb: phytic acid: this is found in unleavened bread raw beans seeds and grains. oxalic acid: this is found in spinach. the calcium that spinach contains will not be absorbed because of this substance. sodium: the higher your sodium intake the more calcium your body needs to meet its daily requirements so it's best to keep your sodium intake down. you can usually meet your needs by having a diet balanced with high-calcium foods. if you need to take a supplement to reach your requirements speak with your physician about the best one for you. your body does not absorb more than 500 mg of calcium at one time so do not try to get all of your calcium in at one meal. vitamin d: this is a fat-soluble vitamin that comes from food and from your body being exposed to the ultraviolet (uv) rays from the sun. the uv rays from the sun trigger the production of vitamin d in your skin. vitamin d is necessary for calcium absorption so it is as essential as calcium is. the sources of vitamin d are: uv rays from the sun: this is probably the most ideal source of vitamin d. an exposure of 10 to 15 minutes of sun to your hands face arms or back without sunscreen for at least two times per week is usually sufficient to provide adequate vitamin d synthesis. sunscreen skin color season geographic latitude time of day clouds and smog affect uv ray exposure and vitamin d synthesis. fortified milk. fish: salmon mackerel and tuna fish. egg yolk. protein: maintain a balance of high-protein foods in your diet. these foods include meat seafood poultry eggs cheese beans and dairy. . phosphorus: this supports building bone and other tissue during growth. there is a wide availability of this in foods so it is not difficult to get adequate amounts in. sources of phosphorus are: dairy foods: milk cheese and yogurt. meat. baked goods. cereal. eggs. nuts. fish. soda. there are numerous other vitamins and minerals that can play a role in preventing osteoporosis."

    "Answer": "citalopram is an antidepressant medication and the abrupt discontinuation of any antidepressant drug can cause severe side effects. please don't do it. i'm not sure if you believe the cramping in your toes and calves could be caused by your citalopram use or not but it's doubtful these things are related -- especially if you've been taking citalopram for awhile. also severe cramping in the toes and calves does not constitute myoclonus which is the uncontrollable jerking of muscles as in a seizure. if you feel you're having side effects from taking citalopram please talk to your health care provider about whether or not you need an antidepressant medication. if you do you certainly can switch to something different. however no one who needs medication for depression should go without it. untreated depression can lead to very poor quality of life. wishing you well! many individuals struggle with withdrawal symptoms when they quit taking many of the short-acting antidepressants. for this reason most doctors suggest that patients use a tapering off method for quitting. please do not quit suddenly or \"cold turkey. \" tapering means that the amount of the drug taken with each use is reduced overtime. most doctors suggest that it is not unreasonable for it to take several months of tapering for an individual to completely stop after many years of use. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Question": "why am i having stinky white thick vaginal discharge around the time of my period? without any burning or itching? . i am taking an oral contraceptive the generic form of seasonique. so i have a period every 3 months. after the first month when i would normally have my period i'm plagued with this horribly smelly thick white vaginal discharge without any burning or itching. i talked to my doctor and she said it was my birth control and i need to start taking something else. before i had this information i kept getting antiboitics and antifungals. should i keep taking them for my problem until i swap bc?",
    "Answer": "a thick white vaginal discharge without a smell is normal. hormonal levels affect the amount and color of your vaginal discharge. since birth control pills contain hormones it is natural that they will affect your vaginal discharge. some birth control pills contain higher levels of estrogen and some are progesterone only without estrogen. if the discharge is bothersome it may be advisable to change to a different type of birth control. the concern with your discharge is that it smells. this could be a sign of an infection. you should see your gynecologist about your discharge and discuss whether it is a sign of infection and whether another birth control pill would be better for you. the estrogen in birth control pills lowers the acidity of secretions in your vagina and increases your risk of yeast infections. a vaginal yeast infection usually causes a sore itchy vagina with a thick clumpy white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese. as long as a vaginal discharge is not associated with pain itching discoloration or a bad odor it can be a positive effect. a vaginal discharge helps lubricate the vagina for intercourse. in women who are not on birth control vaginal discharge can indicate whether or not ovulation is occurring. during ovulation women have an abundant clear wet and stretchy discharge. many women compare the discharge at ovulation to raw egg whites."

    "Question": "i have really bad swelling on my knee last two days been icing and putting it up is there anything else i should do?",
    "Answer": "sorry you're experiencing this. do you know what is causing the swelling? for instance did you injure your knee in some way? or did it suddenly just balloon up? do you have a prosthetic knee (knee replacement)? the reason i ask is because any of those things could cause swelling and the treatment might be different for each cause. you're doing the right thing by elevating your knee. the ice is probably ok if you think the swelling is due to an injury. otherwise the ice is probably useless. and at that ice generally is only indicated for a few days post-injury. if this is a chronic problem (you've had it happen before) or if it doesn't clear up within a few days or if the swelling is accompanied by redness and heat in the joint plus a fever then i'd suggest you seek medical attention. hope this helps and you feel better soon!"

    "Question": "what is lactose intolerance?",
    "Answer": "lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the lactose sugar in milk. milk containing the sugar lactose is a main source of nutrition for infants and young children. with normal lactose tolerance all of the lactose is digested (broken down into two smaller sugars) and absorbed in the small intestine so that none reaches the colon. on the other hand in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. the bacteria produce chemicals that cause diarrhea and also produce gas. some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic acid and other acids that turn the stool acidic. individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing diarrhea gas and often abdominal pain. they instead must drink substitutes like rice or soy milk or treat cow's milk with an enzyme that digests the lactose (lactaid) so that the smaller sugars can be absorbed in the small intestine."

    "Question": "are men and women equally at risk of getting and spreading hepatitis through sex?",
    "Answer": "the risk is determined by a person’s behavior not his/her gender. men who have sex with men are 10 to 15 times more likely than the general population to be infected with hepatitis b. viral hepatitis is also more common among people who come from parts of the world where the disease is endemic including asia sub-saharan africa eastern europe and the middle east. infection is also more common among current or former users of inhaled or injected drugs. people with tattoos or piercings are also more likely to be infected because the needles used to create these body decorations sometimes harbor the hepatitis virus. of course just because someone belongs to one of these risk groups doesn’t mean he or she is infected. and just because someone doesn’t belong to a risk group doesn’t mean he or she is free of infection."

    "Answer": "you are a parent. you don't need me to tell you to worry or not. worrying come naturally. her maternal immunity wore off about a month ago so she is now quite vulnerable to colds (viral infections). because she is so dang cute at this age many people are playing with her so exposure to germs are a sure thing. she will need to get several colds in order to jump-start her own immune systems so get used to them. this first winter can be the cold of the month club. if she is in day-care frequent colds will be a part of your life. coughing can also be triggered by saliva. i suspect she is teething. when he lies down the saliva or any post-nasal drainage has no where to go but down her throat. coughing clears her airways so in some respects it is a good thing. if she is showing signs of illness (fever rapid breathing wheezing failure to improve over time etc. ) she will need to be examined by her medical provider. there will be the sound of coughing in your christmas videso this year."

    "Answer": "home pregnancy tests are very accurate. if you're 2 weeks late and have had 2 negative tests it's unlikely that you're pregnant. many of the symptoms you mention would be quite unusual so early in pregnancy or are not typically associated with pregnancy at all so i would not assume that's what's going on. you should see your doctor to see what is going on as it doesn't sound like pregnancy is the most likely thing at this point."

    "Question": "does 2 or 2 1/2 glasses of wine a day caues high blood preasure?",
    "Answer": "although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. a moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men (under 65 years old) and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old. a serving is considered: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits so the answer to your question depends on if you’re male or female how old you are and whether you’re having an appropriate serving size. if you’re already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isn’t to suggest that you start drinking if you don’t already. the potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too. this would be an area to discuss further with your doctor. drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems. keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension. it’s typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you don’t already and it’s important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol. no yes yes if its a women."

    "Answer": "allergy symptoms such as a runny nose are best treated with an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine (chlor-trimeton). antihistamines are safe for people with diabetes to use. i would not recommend any products that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine such as sudafed or sudafed pe. these medications may increase blood pressure which can be a concern for someone with diabetes. using pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine for only a couple of days may not be a problem. but avoiding them all together is the safest route."

    "Answer": "for this one time only it shouldn't be a problem to take your birth control pills just five days early to be on a different schedule. many women are deciding to do \"three-month cycling\" - taking the birth control pills continuously for three months in a row; having a menstrual period once every three months. this appears to be safe for most women but always check with your medical provider first if you are planning on doing this."

    "Question": "for the past 6 mths my bp has been 90/58 86/64 and 80/58. i am worried. what can cause your bp to be so low?",
    "Answer": "i can understand your concerns. unfortunately you omitted crucial information that would help me evaluate the situation better. generally speaking we don't get too concerned about low blood pressure in people who have no symptoms. in other words if you're not fainting or experiencing an abnormal heart rhythm your low blood pressure may be nothing to be concerned about. of course if you're taking medication for high blood pressure and your pressures have dropped that low then you need to call your doctor right away. these readings could mean you need your medication dosage adjusted. but assuming you're not taking blood pressure medication you may have nothing to worry about regarding your pressure readings. very physically fit people naturally have a lower blood pressure than people who are sedentary and/or obese. are you very physically fit? if so that \"low\" blood pressure may be normal for you. dehydration can cause a person's blood pressure to drop a bit. are you drinking plenty of water throughout the day? by the way when are you taking your blood pressure readings? early-morning resting blood pressure can be quite low. your blood pressure generally comes up as you get active during the day. unless a doctor or healthcare provider told you to monitor your pressures on a regular basis you really don't need to. sometimes the information may be within normal limits yet appear alarming. if you are experiencing symptoms like fainting along with your low blood pressure then i recommend you consult a physician. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what are hormonal causes for heavy periods?",
    "Answer": "in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand. this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime (eshre 2007). even the use of most hormonal contraceptives (pill/patch/ring) will yield a monthly bleed. so it’s no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual. to address the most-pressing question “when should i be concerned? what is the medical definition of too much bleeding? ” there is a medical definition of “too-heavy periods. ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc (2. 7 ounces — about 1/3 of a cup) or more that is excessive bleeding. trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom! some general indications of excessive bleeding can include: * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60-90 minutes for several hours. * passage of large clots (quarter-sized or larger). * significant bleeding for more than seven days. probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities. so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations. hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation-associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don’t decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened. prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows. there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth (“adenoma”) or a problem with the hypothalamus. all of the stress-related causes of not ovulating (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc. ) can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus. increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time. there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed. so if you or someone you know have episodes of heavy blood loss rather than a normal period talk to your doctor because there are ways to stop going with the flow."

    "Question": "my son is 7 and has walking pneumonia. is some activity ok or should he just lay low? about how long?",
    "Answer": "once he starts feeling better breathing well and not coughing as much he can do most any activities. if he becomes too tired or overly stressed then back off a notch. perhaps i would have him hold off on sports participation like soccer until he has fully recovered but he can do most normal activities including going to school if his medical provider gives the \"okay\". there are varying degrees of pneumonia and some are quite mild. he does not have to remain in bed or in the house but remind him that rest is important to his recovery time. i agree with the previous answer. all types of pneumonia really suck out energy and once your son feels like he can start getting back to normal get to it. in my case i had stayed home for about a week and a half then gone to school and not done pe or dance for two weeks and then went back to normal. however i had a friend the same age who had much worse walking pneumonia and had to rest for longer. each case is unique so let him decide when he's ready. now mind you he can still do something. once i was diagnosed a 'short walk' meant a walk to the bathroom and back. when i walked out to the car i ended up taking a nap in it because i was so tired. however once he starts getting stronger taking walks to places like the park can help build him up to who he was before. while it will take a while for him to fully heal he can still do some things. just let him decide about how much energy he can muster. <positive_smiley> -mushyketchup"

    "Answer": "baby : your baby measures 5 to 5. 6 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 5. 25 ounces. the rapid growth spurt is tapering off but reflexes are kicking in. it can yawn stretch and make facial expressions even frown. taste buds are beginning to develop and can distinguish sweet from bitter tastes. the baby will suck if its lips are stroked and it can swallow and even get the hiccups. the retinas have become sensitive to light so if a bright light is shined on your abdomen baby will probably move to shield its eyes. mom-to-be : your uterus about the size of a cantaloupe can probably be felt just below your navel. you're most likely feeling the baby move by now. a mid-pregnancy ultrasound may be performed between now and 22 weeks to assess fetal growth and development and to verify the due date. if the baby is in the right position the ultrasound may even be able to determine whether it's a boy or a girl. your heart has to work 40 percent to 50 percent harder now to support your pregnancy. tip for the week : suggest that your partner go with you for the ultrasound. it's a chance to catch the first glimpse of your baby together as well as provide a snapshot to show friends and family later. sonograms still don't guarantee a healthy baby but they can provide reassurance and spot some problems."

    "Answer": "nothing has ever suggested that ultrasounds are harmful. they just use high frequency sound waves to create the image not radiation like an x-ray would. when you're about 18 weeks along the doctor will perform another ultra-sound because at that time the baby's major organs start to develop so go see that doctor. best wishes."

    "Question": "how can i avoid jet lag?",
    "Answer": "adjustment. that’s the key word when it comes to jet lag and for good reason. when your internal clock doesn’t match the external clock it can be -– and feel -— like world war iii in your body. the problems that arise with jet lag are a clear example of how external influences can disrupt our internal body clock. so what can you do to prevent the jet lag from making your trip a drag? how about setting your body clock to a new time zone before the journey? by using light therapy or an alarm clock that simulates dawn and dusk with techniques to induce sleep you can reset your circadian body clock before a journey thus preventing jet lag from the very start. if you are planning a trip across more than two time zones and want to get accustomed to your destination’s time zone quickly this might be an approach to take. let’s say you have an important business trip for which you have to fly east. before flying you’d go to bed and wake up earlier each day while using a light box in the morning and winding down earlier in the evening. if you’re traveling west you would expose yourself to bright light later in the day go to bed later and wake up a little later in the morning. if you don’t have the time or inclination to get a light box then consider direct sunlight as the next-best alternative. light boxes while producing artificial light that mimics the sun’s intensity don’t emit ultraviolet radiation. they are designed to produce those perfect wavelengths of light (peaking in the optimal “blue” wavelength range or 460 nanometers) and the light gets directed angularly at your eyes for the greatest effect. if you can shift your body clock naturally prior to departing this can be a particularly useful technique if your trip doesn’t allow for much time to adjust before kicking into high gear and demanding your top performance. try and switch over to your new time zone right away by going to bed and getting up at the same time you would normally but on this new time zone. so if you usually go to bed at 10 p. m. in l. a. do the same the first night you land in new york even though your body might think it’s only 7 p. m. then the next morning try and go for a walk outside exposing yourself to light and movement that can help re-set your internal clock. and take my traveler’s survivor kit with you: * ear plugs. * eye mask. * favorite soothing music and head phones or a device like an ipod. * c-shaped pillow that fits around your neck. these strategies can also be used for shift workers."

(adding extra pillows does not work. ) avoid or reduce pressure on your stomach. do not wear tight clothing around your middle. lose weight if you need to. losing just 5 to 10 pounds can help. gerd: controlling heartburn by changing your habits along with lifestyle changes nonprescription medicines may be needed to control occasional heartburn. medicines used for home treatment of gerd include antacids (for example tums) h2 blockers (for example pepcid) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). if you have been using nonprescription medicines to treat your symptoms for longer than 2 weeks talk to your doctor. if you have gerd the stomach acid could be causing damage to your esophagus. your doctor can help you find the right treatment. for more information about prescription forms of these drugs see the medications section of this topic. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "the official response is no you should not go. you will also note many different signs on rides that will say \"if you are pregnant you should not go on this ride\". the safest thing to do is not go on them. if however you are adventuresome then you may want to give it a try. i doubt you will be harmed this early in pregnancy. i think the real issue is how much do you want this pregnancy. if this is planned and a very desired pregnancy then don't do it. otherwise you need to figure it out. your doctor will tell you not to do it."

    "Answer": "safely managing your ear wax is very important when you use in-the-ear hearing aids. you only need to use debrox if your wax is hard or flakey. if your ear wax is soft all you need to do is periodically rinse out your ear canal with a gentle stream of warm water (shower or use an ear syringe). it would be nice if you have a partner and a good home otoscope (inexpensive) so someone can actually look inside your ear canal to see if you do indeed have a wax build-up."

    "Answer": "gallstones can cause pancreatitis and they usually require surgical removal. ultrasound or a ct scan can detect gallstones and can sometimes give an idea of the severity of the pancreatitis. when gallstone surgery can be scheduled depends on how severe the pancreatitis is. if the pancreatitis is mild gallstone surgery may proceed within about a week. more severe cases may mean gallstone surgery is delayed for a month or more. after the gallstones are removed and inflammation goes away the pancreas usually returns to normal."

    "Question": "how is a sinus infection treated?",
    "Answer": "for sinusitis caused by virus infection no antibiotic treatment is required. frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications (such as acetaminophen [tylenol]) decongestants and mucolytics. bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain nasal discharge resembling pus and symptoms persist for longer than a week and are not responding to otc nasal medications. acute sinus infection from bacteria is usually treated with antibiotic therapy aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection since it is unusual to be able to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses. the five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae moraxella catarrhalis staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the antibiotics that are effective treatment for sinus infection must be able to kill these bacterial types. although amoxicillin (amoxil) is an acceptable first antibiotic for an uncomplicated acute sinus infection many physicians choose amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin) as the first-line drug for treatment of a suspected bacterial sinus infection because it is usually effective against most of the species and strains of bacteria that cause the disease. in the penicillin allergic individual cefaclor (ceclor) loracarbef (lorabid) clarithromycin (biaxin) azithromycin (zithromax) sulfamethoxazole (gantanol) trimethoprim (bactrim septra) and other antibiotics may be used as first choices. if a patient is not improving after five days of treatment with amoxicillin the patient may be switched to one of the above drugs or amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin. generally an effective antibiotic needs to be continued for a minimum of 10-14 days. it is however not unusual to need to treat sinus infection for 14-21 days. taking decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and mucolytics (guaifenesin) orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection. the treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications such as augmentin and may require a sinus drainage procedure. this drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia. in general antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to allergy such as from pollens dander or other environmental causes. it is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used. in many people allergic sinusitis develops first and later bacterial infection occurs. for these individuals early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis."

    "Question": "does it take boiling water to extract antioxidants from green tea? do i need to worry about antioxidants?",
    "Answer": "there are countless components in tea that have helpful action in the body (including some acting as antioxidants). the water needs to be hot enough to leach the components from the tea leaves into the water. not necessarily boiling water is needed. something to keep in mind is that the phytochemicals in tea have a half-life of about 4 hours which means they start to break down substantially after that. so. it makes sense to drink some tea in the morning and some in the afternoon and evening to keep a wonderful level of antioxidant phytochemicals in your bloodstream throughout the day. i don't know what you mean about antioxidants in the diet being something to worry about. generally getting antioxidants from foods vs. supplements keep the amounts sensible and health-promoting and in a balance with other nutrients also found in those foods many of which have synergy together."

    "Question": "what is subclinical hypothyroidism?",
    "Answer": "subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a state in which patients do not exhibit the symptoms of hypothyroidism. these patients also have a normal amount of circulating thyroid hormone. the only abnormality is an increased tsh level on their blood work. this implies that the pituitary gland is working extra hard to maintain a normal circulating thyroid hormone level and that the thyroid gland requires extra stimulation by the pituitary to produce adequate hormones. the majority of these patients can be expected to progress to obvious hypothyroidism especially if the tsh is above a certain level. while there is some controversy many endocrinologists will treat such patients especially if they have a high cholesterol blood level. the abnormal cholesterol profile will likely show improvement with thyroid hormone replacement. if the cholesterol levels are normal and the patient feels well it is also reasonable to follow these patients without treatment and repeat the blood tsh and thyroid hormone levels in four to six months to see if more significant hypothyroidism is apparent. both of these approaches are reasonable and patients should be encouraged to speak with their physicians about specific concerns and preferences."

(a person having a seizure cannot swallow their tongue. ) once the seizure ends: roll the individual onto their side. attempt to clear airway of any saliva vomit or blood. if possible check vital signs. stay with patient until they demonstrate normal degree of alertness."

    "Answer": "i'm going to say that unless you're having trouble breathing you probably do not need to get an x-ray done. it's pretty hard to break a rib from an unintentional punch though of course anything's possible. even if the rib is cracked there's not much treatment for it except to bind it. you might try using a wide compression (ace) bandage to see if that helps the pain but don't wrap it excessively tight. gentle support is fine. another possibility is that you tore some cartilage between ribs. that can be very painful and more bad news can take a long time to heal. this could account for why you're still having pain. the only treatment for this type of injury is rest and time. if the pain gets worse over time instead of better; if you develop a fever chills or flu-like symptoms; or if you suddenly have trouble breathing then it's definitely time to get checked out by a doctor insurance or no insurance. otherwise i think you can take a wait-and-see approach to this. over-the-counter pain relievers used according to package directions might give you some relief too. i hope you feel better soon! what kind over the counter meds should i take what's the best so i don't waist money thank you ron"

    "Question": "what is the treatment for a large skin pinch blood blister?",
    "Answer": "a blood blister that results from a pinch is an accumulation of blood as a result of trauma to the skin. it is best not to pop a blood blister as this can lead to infection and possibly even delay the natural healing process of your body. covering the blood blister with a soft dressing to keep it protected can be helpful as it resolves on its own. if the person who has the blood blister has any underlying health conditions especially diabetes it would be appropriate to seek medical care. if the blood blister pops on its own do not peel off the remaining skin. rather leave it in place treat the area with an antiseptic ointment and cover with a clean dressing. allow it to heal in its own time. if the injury is very recent ice can help to reduce the pain that the trauma initially induced."

    "Answer": "cold medications are rarely used in this age group. infant colds are typically treated with saline nasal drops with mucous aspiration using a bulb syringe and a cool mist humidifier. if a one month old is having a fever seems to be worsening or \"can't breathe\" as you stated it would be wise to seek medical care. colds in a one month old with their immature immune systems can lead to more serious complications like pneumonia. in most cases however colds are simply annoying and self-limiting."

    "Answer": "a few ideas come to mind. anxiety? stage fright? low blood sugar? even if you've never experienced these before they can come on suddenly and without warning. did these symptoms occur when you were doing something in front of the class? if so my guess would be you experienced an episode of anxiety. if you weren't performing in front of the class then perhaps you had a bout of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). even though you say you ate breakfast the quality of the breakfast can influence your glucose levels. for example if you ate only pancakes and syrup you certainly could experience a dip in your sugars. if you ate some protein along with some whole grains then it would be less likely you experienced a dip in blood sugar. if you are otherwise healthy and this has never happened before there's probably no need to have it checked out. we all experience occasional bouts of panic or hypoglycemia. if it happens again or begins happening frequently then you should make an appointment to see a health care provider for an evaluation. good for you for maintaining your hydration. it's very important to overall good health!"

    "Answer": "unfortunately my answer is: many things could cause this. floaters in the eye aren't uncommon. these tiny flecks of tissue can well float through your vision from time to time. the condition is usually harmless but in some cases can point to more serious underlying eye problems. so if this visual disturbance is a new symptom you should visit an ophthalmologist soon to get it checked out. migraine headaches also can include a component of visual disturbance called an 'aura. ' if you're experiencing the visual distortion you describe with a headache you'd be well-advised to see a medical professional for treatment. occasionally the type of symptoms you're describing can be an indicator of something serious like retinal detachment. if the symptoms are severe or you notice them getting rapidly worse please go to an emergency room. these conditions need to be treated promptly. otherwise you might start with your primary care provider or an eye doctor to see if you can get to the bottom of what's going on. good luck!"

    "Answer": "a wart develops when a human papillomavirus infects the outermost layer of skin and causes the skin cells to grow rapidly. the virus can then spread from an existing wart to other areas of the body causing more warts. various types of this virus thrive in warm damp environments such as showers locker room floors and swimming pool areas. you are most likely to develop a wart where you have broken skin such as a cut hangnail closely bitten nail or scrape. plantar warts are common to swimmers whose feet are not only damp and softened but are also scratched and broken by rough pool surfaces. common warts are often seen among those who handle meat chicken and fish. how are warts spread? warts are easily spread by direct contact with a human papillomavirus. you can reinfect yourself by touching the wart and then another part of your body. you can infect others by sharing towels razors or other personal items. after exposure to a human papillomavirus it can take 2 to 9 months of slow growth beneath the skin before you notice a wart. 1 it is unlikely that you will develop a wart every time you are exposed to a human papillomavirus. some people are more likely to develop warts than others. genital warts are very contagious. for more information see the topic genital warts. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what are some common bottle-feeding problems and mistakes?",
    "Answer": "i think sometimes parents jump to the conclusion that a baby’s gas or fussiness is caused by their baby formula. instead it just may be that baby is at a stage when she’s colicky. so instead of changing baby’s formula all around you’d really do better to talk to your pediatrician. that’s because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic for which we have no known cause -- or cure. so instead of parents agonizing about the formula they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic which is usually at about three months. another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: some lie them completely flat which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. so be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. another common mistake is propping the bottle. don’t prop baby’s bottle; it can be a choking hazard. that is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding even when she’s old enough to hold her own bottle. . the main thing: do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. so don’t stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. actually the same goes for formula diapers and all baby things: [don’t stock up] unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand. also when you’re bottle feeding make sure milk is filling up the nipple of baby’s bottle. otherwise she could swallow a lot of air."

    "Answer": "oh dear. it's never good to put antibiotic drops in the wrong orifice. in general any time you accidentally get something in your eye -- whether it's prescription drops like ofloxacin or dust from the wind -- you should take a moment to rinse your eyes with water. if you have saline solution (such as wetting solution for contact lenses) then use this. but if not then tap water will have to do. to rinse your eyes bend over a sink and allow the water to flow across your eyeball and down the drain. keep this up for 3-5 minutes. the good news for you is that ofloxacin is an antibiotic drop that is often prescribed for infections of the eye. so if you got a drop or two in your eye it probably will not cause any damage. you should still rinse it out if possible just to be safe. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "although research suggests that people who stop exercising gain more weight over time than people who stay active everyone is different. exercise especially the type that strengthens the body helps build muscle which weighs more than fat. after exercise is stopped there is some lean tissue loss. people who stop exercising also tend to eat the same (or more) calories resulting in eventual weight gain. but you might be different and actually eat less which could be another reason you lose weight. i always recommend exercise for people who want to gain weight i n a healthy way. because exercise is healthy and keeps weight on you it makes sense to keep it up. best of health to you!"

    "Answer": "the sooner the better! at birth start cleaning your child’s gums with a soft infant toothbrush or a cloth and water. as soon as the teeth begin to appear start brushing twice daily using fluoridated toothpaste and a soft age-appropriate sized toothbrush. use only a small smear of toothpaste to brush the teeth of a child less than 2 years old. for the 2-5-year-olds dispense a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and perform or assist your child’s tooth brushing. remember that young children do not have the ability to brush their teeth effectively."

    "Answer": "the short answer is: no it's not safe. no one should adjust their doses of prescription drugs without consulting a doctor. in your case you're taking one anti-anxiety medication and one antidepressant. you should not adjust the dosage of either of these medications without checking with your doctor first. if you feel the prozac (fluoxetine) is not helping your depression i'd suggest you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. he or she may want to change your antidepressant medication to something else. there are plenty of antidepressants to choose from. i wish you all the best!"

    "Question": "can the appendix grow back? . i have had my appendix removed back in 1989. i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good. how can that be if it was removed? is it possible it has grown back?",
    "Answer": "well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps! i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an \"expert\" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail."

    "Answer": "it's difficult to give you a straight answer without a bit more background information. but let me at least explain a common misconception about thyroid lab tests and results so that you can talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns. usually thyroid function is measured using a blood test that looks at tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone). a high tsh number means a low level of circulating thyroid hormone in your blood. that seems backwards doesn't it? a low tsh number means you have a higher level of thyroid hormone in your blood. so if your tsh lab result was \"high \" you may still be hypothyroid. if your tsh lab result was \"low \" you may be considered in the normal range or in the hyperthyroid range. if in fact you have moved from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) your healthcare provider will discuss ways of treating this condition. in general thyroid disorders are highly treatable. you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your recent lab results and what they mean. that way you'll have peace of mind about what's really going on and what treatment options are available to you."

    "Question": "what are gallstones?",
    "Answer": "gallstones are stones that form in the gall (bile). bile is a watery liquid made by the cells of the liver that is important for digesting food in the intestine particularly fat. liver cells secrete the bile they make into small canals within the liver. the bile flows through the canals and into larger collecting ducts within the liver (the intrahepatic bile ducts). the bile then flows within the intrahepatic bile ducts out of the liver and into the extrahepatic bile ducts -- first into the hepatic bile ducts then into the common hepatic duct and finally into the common bile duct. from the common bile duct there are two different directions that bile can flow. the first direction is on down the common bile duct and into the intestine where the bile mixes with food and promotes digestion of food. the second direction is into the cystic duct and from there into the gallbladder (often misspelled as gall bladder). once in the gallbladder bile is concentrated by the removal (absorption) of water. during a meal the muscle that makes up the wall of the gallbladder contracts and squeezes the concentrated bile in the gallbladder back through the cystic duct into the common duct and then into the intestine. (concentrated bile is much more effective for digestion than the un-concentrated bile that goes from the liver straight into the intestine). the timing of gallbladder contraction -- during a meal -- allows the concentrated bile from the gallbladder to mix with food. gallstones usually form in the gallbladder; however they also may form anywhere there is bile; in the intrahepatic hepatic common bile and cystic ducts. gallstones also may move about within bile for example from the gallbladder into the cystic or common duct."

    "Answer": "psychological stress is known to affect many physiological processes including hormone levels and the function of the immune system both of which can play a role in fertility. while there is no proof that stress alone is a cause of infertility some studies have shown that stress can adversely affect outcome in people undergoing fertility treatments and may be an aggravating factor for infertility. however trying to conceive for 10 months without success is not yet considered indicative of a fertility problem. in the absence of known conditions that may affect the reproductive system infertility is defined as the absence of conception after a period of 1 year. many couples who eventually conceive without fertility treatment do so after waiting even longer than a year. since your girlfriend is already feeling stressed it would make sense to develop a stress management plan and to learn skills to help control her stress levels. exercise proper nutrition relaxation techniques a regular sleep cycle and psychological counseling if needed can all significantly reduce symptoms due to emotional stress and lead to improvements in physical and mental well-being. if your girlfriend is concerned that an emotional or physical problem may be interfering with your ability to conceive she should discuss this with her doctor who can help determine whether you have a fertility problem."

    "Answer": "the correct and less-vulgar term for the male genitalia is \"penis\" and the answer is a remote possibility of yes since there is viable sperm present in the tiny amount of semen that can leak during sexual excitation. if you were ovulating at the time there is a remote possibility of a pregnancy occurring. needless to say if you and this penis-owner do not plan on having a child at this time you will be wise to cautious with your sex-play."

    "Answer": "with the earnings you describe for a family of 6 your son and daughter-in-law and their children will no doubt qualify for medicaid which will provide them with insurance at no cost. however they'll need to see if their state is expanding its program. you can check healthcare. gov to find out more information or webmd's state pages. even if medicaid is not an option for the whole family because they live in a state that isn't expanding its program it's likely that the kids will still qualify. and without medicaid if the lowest cost health insurance plan amounts to more than 8% of their annual income they will not be required to buy insurance."

    "Question": "what is osteoarthritis?",
    "Answer": "osteoarthritis (ah-stee-oh-ar-threye-tis) is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people. sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis. osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage (kar-til-uj) the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. it also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. in osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also small deposits of bone – called osteophytes or bone spurs – may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. this causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and some movement limitations. unlike some other forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joint function and does not affect skin tissue the lungs the eyes or the blood vessels. in rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of arthritis the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints leading to pain inflammation and eventually joint damage and malformation. it typically begins at a younger age than osteoarthritis causes swelling and redness in joints and may make people feel sick tired and uncommonly feverish."

    "Question": "are there any exercises or stretches i can do to prevent shin splints?",
    "Answer": "shin splints is a condition where there is pain along the shinbone (tibia) resulting from too much stress on the tibia and the connective tissues particularly ligaments and tendons that attach the muscles in the lower leg to the bone. they can be caused by sudden increases in mileage walking or running uphill or downhill walking or running faster than normal jumping running stairs training for too long or too hard (overtraining syndrome) wearing poorly fitted or worn-out footwear or starting with too much exercise after a period of inactivity. they can occur on the medial (inside) of the shin or on the lateral (outside) of your shin. medial shin splints can be caused by excessive pronation or flat feet pounding from running or sports like tennis volleyball basketball and other weight-bearing activities particularly where you stop and start frequently. if you have medial shin splints and flat feet (excessive pronation) an orthotic device or over-the-counter arch support can sometimes be helpful for preventing shin splints. make sure it's a full-length insert. lateral shin splints (sometimes called anterior shin splints) are usually due to overuse and inflammation of the anterior tibialis muscle and the muscle compartment in the front of the leg along the outside front of your shin. the anterior tibialis muscle flexes your foot upward and individuals frequently get anterior shin splints from the repetition of flexing the muscle. for instance walking fast and/or uphill on a treadmill or increasing the speed or elevation substantially can overwork the anterior tibialis muscle and cause it to cramp. this can lead to shin splints or just a simple case of muscle cramping. it is difficult to stretch the anterior tibialis muscle to prevent shin splints. you can try to stretch the muscle by sitting and crossing your leg so your ankle is resting on the other knee and pulling on your foot (as if you are pointing your toe). this may or may not have an effect. massage of the anterior muscle while in this position may also be helpful. occasionally stretching the calves can help (the gastrocnemius muscle). to do that: (1) stand facing a wall (2) lean against the wall with both arms and elbows slightly bent (3) bring one leg forward with the knee bent (4) keep the other leg straight with the heel on the floor and (5) lean the hips toward the wall while keeping your back straight. another stretch that might be helpful is for the soleus muscle which is low in the calf. to do that: (1) do the standard calf stretch as described (2) while in the stretched position bend the back knee slightly and (3) you will feel this lower on the leg (just above your achilles tendon). hold all stretches until you feel looser. to strengthen the anterior tibialis: (1) sit on the floor (2) tie an elastic exercise band around the leg of a table or chair and then wrap it over your toes (3) pull on the band by flexing your foot and (4) repeat 10 times for three sets. to strengthen the calves do heel raises: (1) while standing rise up on your toes (2) slowly lower to the floor and (3) repeat 10 times for three sets. you can also do heel raises by standing on the edge of a step with your heels hanging off for greater range of motion (your heel drops lower than the step). stop these exercises if you have pain. the best prevention for shin splints is to find out what is causing it (for example overuse flat feet etc. ) and fix that problem. for example if you are overtraining then cut back; if you use the treadmill at the same speed and elevation all the time then vary it; if you have flat feet then an insert or prescription orthotic may be helpful; if you do impact sports then take a break and cross-train with lower-impact activities like biking; if your shoes fit poorly or are worn out then get new shoes. shin splints can be persistent and so if they continue you ought to see your doctor for a proper referral to either an orthopedist or podiatrist. your doctor will know what type of referral you need."

    "Answer": "many factors can change your body's need for iron. for example going through menopause puts women at lower risk for iron deficiency due to the loss of menses. many times someone starts to take iron supplements and also increases iron in their diet meaning they eventually get too much iron once their stores are repleted. here are some ways to decrease your iron intake: if you take a multivitamin take one without iron check the label and eliminate foods fortifed with iron (e. g. cereals energy bars waffles etc. ) lastly you can decrease the amount of meat products you eat. the iron in animal foods (heme) is better absorbed than plant foods (none-heme). this article outlines which foods are high in iron <link> make sure you continue to work with your healthcare provider and check your iron levels so the other problem doesn't come back. seeing a registered dietitian can also help. you can find one at eatright. org."

    "Question": "my friend says some of the antidepressant generics aren't as good as the brand versions like wellbutrin. is that true?",
    "Answer": "we are finding out that it all depends on the patient. in some cases generics for certain antidepressants have been around a long time for prozac and zoloft recently. there were some medications on the extended release family and like wellbutrin that patients are having some problems with. in that case it's putting these issues to your pharmacist your doctor or healthcare provider. patients that may complaint that they not be feeling as well. they may experience a little more side-effects and it's just the way the drug is released. so the patient may need to be switched back to the brand medication such as wellbutrin. lexapro there currently is no generic so lexapro will be at brands. but we are finding out so much more that how i take a pill and how you take a pill might be completely different. it may help you it may not help me necessarily. so antidepressant therapy is becoming a category that therapy needs to be individualized based on the patient. we ask patients to make sure that they keep a diary to see how they are feeling. this is also a case where you may start a medication. it's not going to work right away in the case of depression. usually you have to take it for a few weeks before you see any improvements. so you want to keep in touch with your physician or healthcare provider and let them know i am doing better or maybe not and they might switch you or increase the dose to see if that helps at all. talk to your pharmacist though if you have any problems or questions we are more than happy to help you. especially if you don't feel well with the generic we can switch you back to the brand. that's not a problem."

    "Question": "how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?",
    "Answer": "doctors make a diagnosis of oa based on a physical exam and history of symptoms. the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based on a combination of the following factors: * a description of symptoms. * the location and pattern of pain. * certain findings in a physical examination. x-rays may be used to confirm a diagnosis and to make sure that no other type of arthritis is present. most people over age 60 reflect the disease on x-ray; about a third of patients have actual symptoms. sometimes blood tests are administered. while blood tests cannot point to anything in particular that can help a doctor confirm the presence of oa the tests can help the doctor determine the presence of a different type of arthritis. if fluid has accumulated in the body's joints the doctor may remove some of the fluid with a process called joint aspiration and may examine the fluid under a microscope to rule out other diseases."

    "Answer": "i can certainly see your concern however since your pregnancy test was negative it is unlikely that you are pregnant. i would recommend that you see your doctor just to make sure since you are having symptoms of being pregnant. your doctor may also do some bloodwork including a thyroid test to see why you may be having the unusual menstrual cycles and the other symptoms which you are experiencing."

    "Question": "i bought listerine zero and it has no ada symbol. will it help my gums like normal listerine does?",
    "Answer": "who says that listerine is good for your gums? i personally never understood this fascination that people have with rinsing. the only thing that controls gingivitis prevents periodontitis and bad breath is the actual act of brushing and flossing one's teeth! everything else is just fluff. there are mouthwashes that can help control the deleterious bacteria in our mouth (mainly chlorhexidine-peridex) however they are \"by prescription\" and stain our teeth. they are used by many peridontists and other dentists to control bacteria after dental surgery but we recommend their use only for a limited time. in addition if you ask dental pathologists (the specialists in the diseases of the mouth) many will tell you that many mouthwashes are laden with alcohol which actually damages our gums. it is compounded by the fact that people rinse their mouth with an alcohol-based mouthwash and then go and smoke a cigarette. they kill that top protective layer of cells with the alcohol and introduce the carcinogens from the cigarettes right into the sub-layer of the gums causing more damage. review your brushing technique and timing. speak to your hygienist/dentist/periodontist about proper brushing technique and use the mouth rinse when you need fresh breath for a few minutes (this is how long the effects of mouthwash last). as to the ada approval. any reputable company can pay the fee required to get the ada seal. it is a great marketing device but the real agency of approval is the fda (food and drug administration). if a product is approved to be sold by a pharmacy it is likely to have fda approval. that should be ok. my recommendation: don't waste your hard-earned money on mouthwashes. spend your money on professional cleanings and go to a dentist/hygienist who cares enough to give you feedback on your home care and educate you in proper hygiene. you will get much more \"bang for your buck. \""

    "Answer": "i have the same symptoms. i feel its closer to the bronchitis side of things because of the clear mucus i cough when i am not riding. i am able to comfortably take my heart rate over 160 but i still have a cough which lasts for weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection (generally also involving the sinuses. i also get the odd drainage from my sinuses after/during a hot shower for example which seems to clear them. my explanation is as follows: when i am riding outdoors in the summer i breath a lot of pollens (i am not in the city) a little exhaust and this will tend to exacerbate an existing irritation. corticosteroids have limited effect to reduce the irritation but can reduce an acute irritation to the point where it is no longer chronic and my body's defenses can make a difference. thus its a combination of factors which typically plays out in the following order 1. bad cold/urt infection (5 days) 2. chronic cough (1 week to 8 weeks) but lungs good enough to exercise. 3. clear 2-8 months managing the level 2 is what this is all about. on occasions where i have been at the coast swimming in the sea often clears things up much faster.

    "Question": "why does caffeine make thirsty?",
    "Answer": "one of the reasons why caffeine may be making your thirsty is because caffeine is a diuretic meaning that it can make you urinate more frequently. as a result dehydration and increased thirst may occur if your body is getting rid of too much fluid. caffeine isn’t a strong diuretic so there is typically a net gain in water retention if you only consume a moderate amount of caffeine but large enough doses could dehydrate you though your individual response and caffeine-sensitivity may vary. diuretics can also be used as a medication for heart-related conditions like high blood pressure so your symptom of feeling thirsty may be worse if you’re on this medication or one with similar side effects. also depending on what you’re consuming say coffee or tea you could also be experiencing astringency from the naturally occurring bitter plant compound called tannin. astringency can be described as the dry puckering sensation in your mouth that you get by consuming tannin which might be making you feel thirsty. coffee is typically low in tannin content but tea especially black tea is high in tannins."

    "Answer": "cardiomegaly is an enlarged heart. in most cases enlargement of the heart occurs over an extended period of time (weeks or more often years) due to an injury to the heart. the heart responds to the injury by remodeling itself in a way that lets it continue to do its job of pumping blood. this sometimes results in a stretching of the heart muscle. the condition may also be called dilated cardiomyopathy. the most common causes of cardiomegaly are: high blood pressure that’s inadequately treated for a long time coronary artery disease or heart attacks alcohol abuse viral myocarditis (heart infection by a virus) postpartum cardiomyopathy (unexplained heart enlargement after delivering a baby) in many cases no cause can be identified which is called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. the heart may also only appear enlarged on a chest x-ray (the traditional way doctors have diagnosed cardiomegaly). an abnormal amount of fluid around a normal-sized heart (pericardial effusion) will deceptively enlarge the heart’s shadow on a chest x-ray film. an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) is usually recommended for people with an enlarged heart. an echocardiogram can tell the difference between a pericardial effusion and true cardiomegaly and can provide additional information about the heart’s shape and function."

    "Answer": "no these are all basically worthless \"quack\" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very unpleasant. a viral infection such as the common cold can last as long as 14 days though most people only experience symptoms for up to a week. so it's possible this is a virus. on the other hand it could be a sinus infection. i've heard patients describe a \"crushing\" sensation with sinus infections. no matter what's causing your symptoms i think after a week of suffering through them you deserve a diagnosis. i'd suggest visiting your primary care provider to see what's going on. if it's something that can be treated with antibiotics then you'll get a prescription and should feel better within days after starting on the meds. if you do receive a prescription for antibiotics be sure to take the entire course of pills. do not stop taking them just because you begin feeling better. this is very important. you've done the right thing by trying to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter products but obviously that hasn't helped. i hope you'll now seek medical attention. you've earned it. all the best to you!"

    "Question": "i have a really big stomach it's the biggest part of my body. i look like i am 20 months pregnant! . as a matter of fact people ask me if i am pregnant! i am kind of sick of it. if i go on a diet and try to lose it what happens to the leftover skin? will i lose that too? i am afraid to go on a diet because of it.",
    "Answer": "people who lose large amounts of weight may end up having excess skin. each person is different though and it's hard to predict who is more vulnerable. some people choose to have excess skin removed once they have maintained weight loss for a period of time. the key is to lose weight for your health and quality of life and then you can decide what you want to do if there is extra skin. for more on medical options for excess skin see this article. good luck!"

    "Answer": "it is not uncommon to take birth control to help regulate hormone cycles preventative medications to prevent the onset of a migraine (topamax inderal limbitrol) and symptomatic relief medications (imitrex) all together. hydrocodone basically covers up the pain. to take three preventative medications along with everything else you listed does seem like a bit much. i would look at lifestyle modifications that you could possibly make in order to aid in the decrease of migraine frequency. i would also seek another medical opinion from a migraine specialist or neurologist to see if all these medications are necessary. keep in mind that a few of these medications have side effects of headaches which could be a trigger to worsen or cause your migraines."

    "Answer": "thrush has a cottage cheese appearance in the mouth. usually creamy white spots dot your tongue or inner cheeks. most of the people i've worked with who have thrush say it's quite painful. thrush is basically a yeast infection of the mouth. it is caused by the candida fungus. it can be caused by uncontrolled diabetes hiv or even something as simple as taking antibiotics. you may be experiencing thrush or you may have something very common called fordyce spots. these usually occur along the lip line (vermilion border) or just inside the lips. this condition is benign (not life-threatening). if your tongue is numb or painful and covered with white spots you probably should get checked out by a doctor. if you're running a fever you definitely should get checked. you can't self-treat thrush so if you do have it you need to get a prescription mouth rinse. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "for effective elimination of head lice the infested individual family members that are also infested and the home must all be treated. treatment of the individual and the infected family members over-the-counter (otc) or prescription medications are used to treat the affected people and their families. follow these treatment steps: remove all clothing. apply lice medicine also called pediculicide according to the label instructions. if your child has extra long hair you may need to use a second bottle. warning: do not use a cream rinse or combination shampoo/conditioner before using lice medicine. do not re-wash hair for one to two days after treatment. have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. if some live lice are still found eight to 12 hours after treatment but are moving more slowly than before do not retreat. comb dead and remaining live lice out of the hair. the medicine sometimes takes longer to kill the lice. if eight to 12 hours after treatment no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before the medicine may not be working. see your health-care provider for a different medication and follow their treatment instructions. nit (head lice egg) combs often found in lice medicine packages should be used to remove nits and lice from the hair shaft. many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. after the initial treatment check comb and remove nits and lice from hair every two to three days. re-treat in seven to 10 days. check all treated people for two to three weeks until you are sure all lice and nits are gone. treating the house: treating the whole house is a laborious but important task. follow these steps: machine wash all washable clothing and bed linens that the infested person touched during the two days before treatment (to kill the lice and nits). use the hot water cycle (130 degrees f; 55 degrees c) to wash clothes. dry laundry using the hot cycle for at least 20 minutes. dry clean clothing that is not washable (coats hats scarves etc. ) or store all clothing stuffed animals comforters etc. that cannot be washed or dry cleaned into a plastic bag and seal it for two weeks. soak combs and brushes for one hour in rubbing alcohol lysol or wash with soap and hot (130 degrees f; 55 degrees c) water and then place in bag and leave in freezer for two days. vacuum the floor and furniture. do not use fumigant sprays.

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through that. leg pain can be so uncomfortable! it's hard to tell exactly what's going on without a physical examination but my best guess would be shin splints. this annoying condition can affect people who jog for exercise but they also can hit people who just once ran to catch a cab or something. if the problem is shin splints the best advice is not to perform the activity that causes the pain. so if this is occuring because you're walking fast for exercise try slowing down your pace. if it just occurred randomly from a single activity (like catching that cab) then probably just resting the leg will allow for healing. there are more tips at the link above. hope you feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer in this case there a few things i would suggest. you can call your insurer to complain that you're unable to find a provider who will see you and ask specifically for help in locating someone who can. don't be afraid to ask for a supervisor -- often the customer service folks answering the phones don't have the authority to do anything out of the ordinary. understand for yourself -- and communicate this fact when you call your insurer -- that medicaid managed care organizations are required by law to comply with standards for access to care. the standards are intended to ensure that each company maintains a network of providers that is sufficient to provide adequate access to medicaid services. you can check with your state's department of insurance to determine what those standards are where you live and whether your plan is violating them. if it is you should file an official complaint with your state's department of insurance. also contact your state's office of the health care advocate where you can get help dealing with your health plan as well as finding a provider and filing a complaint about your insurer's practices."

    "Answer": "hi what your about to read did you do this? the effectiveness of most birth control pills is strongly affected by how consistently they are taken. the effectiveness or side effects of birth control pills can be altered by taking them late or by not taking them at the same time each day. therefore to get the highest effectiveness from birth control pills take them at the same time every day. if you miss one of more pills refer to the manufacturer package insert that came with your pills. in general for most pills the following should be followed: if you have a 28-day pack and you missed any of the last 7 pills in the pack - don't worry about it (except mircette where the last 7 pills do matter). in a 28-day pack the last 7 pills are placebo or \"sugar\" pills. these have no active ingredients; the pills are just there to help you know when to start your new pack. but make sure you start your new pack on time. if you miss taking one or more pills (except the last 7 pills in the 28-day pack) you may not be protected from pregnancy. - see more at: <link>#sthash. ejo0b3gz. dpuf. yes as you can see it was a gathered piece of information i found this a piece of help. so at anytime did you miss a pill or two was your timing out are you now back taking your pills you missing your period could be from just the extra hormones in your body they can do things like missing a period but you should have just kept to the pattern of taken your bc pills. but as long as you used condoms for the first 7 days and with not getting your period in the placebo week you should have been using condoms with not having a period with luck you may not be pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck ps if like most of us and you have a mobile phone set the alarm on it for the time you want to take you bc pill its a winner."

    "Answer": "that is pretty odd to have occurred as many times in one year as it has. i had pink eye once in my life and never since. it might have to do with washing necessary materials where your eye comes close or in contact with when you have pinkeye. i know i caught strep throat at college 3 times in one semester because i forgot to change my toothbrush once and didn't wash my sheets the second time so maybe close approximation to objects has been keeping the bacteria in close proximity to certain living spaces you reside often. xbox controllers and so on should be wiped down with clorox antibacterial wipes to disinfect any bacteria. hope this helps"

    "Question": "accutane-still no effect? . hi im on my 8th day on accutane and i think that this medication have no effect on me i mean my skin is still oily as hell i have no dry lips and i finally want dry skin how long should i have to wait for it? and my skin even got worse i dont know why but i have more breakouts than usual and if you are wondering im on low dose isotretinoin-20 mg /day. should i wait for any effect or just stop it because i feel like this medication has no effect on me? thnx",
    "Answer": "be patient. accutane takes time to achieve its remarkable effects; often one or two months. certainly not eight days. as a matter of fact things could actually appear worse before they get better namely in the way of dry cracked lips. your expectations of an immediate cure of your acne are unrealistic but you have been placed on the most effective acne medicine on the market. it will work but you need to give time. good things will happen to those who wait."

    "Question": "are denture adhesives safe?",
    "Answer": "dental adhesives are safe as long as they are used as directed. if the denture is well-fitting and the adhesive is only used to give added stability there should be no ill effects. if adhesives are used excessively to fill voids for an ill-fitting denture they can be harmful to the underlying soft and hard tissues. occasionally in these cases inflammation of the soft tissues can result. in addition because of its movement on the soft tissue and underlying bone an ill-fitting denture can cause bone loss."

    "Question": "i have one bowel bigger than the other could it cause future problems",
    "Answer": "i'm not sure what you mean by this exactly. every person has a large intestine and a small intestine. these are sometimes called the \"large bowel\" and \"small bowel. \" they small bowel is literally smaller in diameter than the large bowel. this is normal. the small intestine is where most of the nutrients from food are absorbed. the large intestine serves mainly to extract water and consolidate fibrous waste products left over after food passes through the small intestine. these waste products then are passed out of the body as stool. so it is perfectly normal to have one bowel bigger than the other. it should not cause you any problems. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. a torn rotator cuff can be very painful to live with! i suggest you have a good long conversation with your surgeon about your concerns regarding rotator cuff surgery. it's not uncommon for a person to have second thoughts about undergoing surgery or to think of questions they wish they'd asked at the initial consultation. a good surgeon will want to make sure you're completely comfortable with your decision to have surgery -- or not. and remember it is your decision. i recommend you make the decision hand-in-hand with your doctor because he or she has the medical expertise to guide you in your decision-making process. you can always request to be re-assessed to see if surgery still makes sense in your situation. not all torn rotator cuffs are treated with surgery. that said if surgery is recommended your surgeon can explain how your sickle cell anemia may affect the healing process and what things he or she plans to do to reduce any chances of complications. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner? what are the risks if he is infected? . hello . i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear. however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms. i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him? i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about? . thank you",
    "Answer": "first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care! i recently went to my gynecologist and well i was told that i had abnormal cells on the cervix and that hpv caused it. my doctor said that everybody has hpv if you had sex at least once. that is why you need to have that pap-smear done every year to detect cancer cells which are caused by this hpv virus (in between other things). so needless to say that you cannot avoid transmitting it to him since he already has it unless he has never had sex. don't quote me. i read about it and it enforces what my doctor said according to the info i got however educated and uneducated people will have different discussions about this. the best thing is to go see your own personal doctor and ask them these questions. good luck <positive_smiley>"
