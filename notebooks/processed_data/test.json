    "Question": "how can exercise help my sleep?",
    "Answer": "so exercise and sleep there’s significant amount of data to show that a regular amount of exercise will help with sleep specifically increasing deep sleep. so one of the questions when we talk about working with the boomers and people who are in that age range is that if they can get daily exercise it will actually help increase their overall sleep. do you want to exercise right before bed? well that’s a great question and the data is very mixed on this. i have some patients who are what i call type-a personalities and pretty anxious folks. i actually have them exercising before bed which isn’t something that is usually recommended because for them exercise causes a relaxation response. so for them it’s perfect to exercise before bed. i have other patients people who are a little bit more melancholy and blue where exercise actually gives them energy so these people i have them exercising in the morning. so it really depends upon your overall personality type to know and understand when you should exercise. but overall i definitely recommend exercise for sleep."

    "Answer": "unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs like florida are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. but you may be misinformed about what you are and are not eligible for. your roommate's income for example doesn't count toward your household income simply because you share a home. you would need to file taxes together in order for your incomes to impact one another for health insurance subsidies. open enrollment is now closed for the year but if you recently lost your job and health insurance you may qualify for a special enrollment period. if you do you might be eligible for private insurance at highly subsidized rates. i suggest you go to healthcare. gov and perhaps pick up the phone to speak with someone to make sure you've explored all of your options."

    "Question": "can chickenpox be prevented with a vaccine?",
    "Answer": "most people develop lifetime immunity to chickenpox after the first occurrence and never experience it again. but the virus can sometimes resurface later in life as shingles (zoster). the current aim in the u. s. and many other countries is to achieve universal (or nearly universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine. the vaccination requires only two shots. the first vaccination is given at about 1 year of age and the second (booster) is given at 4 years of age. if an older person has not had chickenpox the shot may be given at any time. there have been few significant adverse reactions to the chickenpox vaccine. all children except those with a compromised immune system should have the vaccination. vaccination has been associated with a 90% decrease in the incidence of chickenpox and significantly lower complication rates in those who do develop the symptoms."

    "Answer": "is it behaving like a normal period or just spotting? how long is it lasting for? i'm not sure why your back would hurt and am not trying to get your hopes up here but spotting happens around implantation too. your body can also do strange things around ovulation. if it turns out to actually be your period notice what you've been eating. significant changes in diet or weight can impact it. also significant increases in stress or change in exercise habits. if it lasts longer than your normal period or other strange symptoms arise i'd at least call the nurse practitioner at your gyno's office and ask. and in another 6 days take a pregnancy test just to know."

    "Answer": "why [not] flumist? it is an equally effective (some studies say \"more effective\") flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose. no needles. when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things: 1. i give them choices. they can have one shot (assuming they only need one) or two! 2. i can give them a \"booster\" instead of a shot. (it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful! ) 3. they can get it in their arm or leg where it doesn't hurt very much or their eye! (of course we don't do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice. 4. i tell them this: \"i am not supposed to do this but if you don't tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle. the one we use for infants instead of the big-person needle. how about that? \" 5. and finally. \"if this little \"booster\" hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately! \" (of course she is going to do that anyway. ) the games we play. \"convince\" a reluctant \"child\" to get a flu shot? who is the adult and who is the child. there's no convincing a child. i've seen bribery done. if it was my situation the child would have learned right from the beginning that sometimes we must do things that aren't the most pleasant but will be over soon. never lie to a child and say it won't hurt. there was one thing i taught and allowed my children to do for a shot: either alone or accompanied by me to sing as loud as possible happy birthday. it always worked and they always wanted me to sing along loud. of course the dr. was warned first."

    "Answer": "i think you mean micrograms (mcg) instead of milligrams (mg). if you really are taking 105mg that would equal 105 000mcg. the recommended amount of vitamin b12 for adults is 2. 4mcg. but there is no upper limit set by the institute of medicine because no adverse effects have been found with taking excess vitamin b12. because it is a water soluble vitamin it's potential for toxicity is low. most people get enough from diet unless they are vegetarians older or have a health condition that decreases the absorption of vitamin b12. for more on proper dosing and side effects see this webmd page."

    "Answer": "pregnancy is really about numbers: one of your wife's eggs available for fertilization (at the time of ovulation) and a few hundred million of your sperm waiting around for that egg to emerge. the odd are really in favor of fertilization in most cases. having sex everyday is just fine. you don't really have to wait and store up a volume of semen (the bulk of an ejaculation is not sperm but semen from the prostate gland). the more sperm that is ready and waiting the better. the color or consistency is not something you should worry about. the semen really needs to be where you can't see it if you know what i mean. assuming everything is in order the frequency that you have sex the volume of your semen will not be a major factor in achieving a successful pregnancy but you do have to have sex so get off of the computer and go for it."

    "Answer": "your period really has no way of directly affecting the behavior of others but your own behavior may be very effected. in other words you may have less tolerance to behaviors that you would otherwise ignore. hormonal fluctuations can definitely affect you and your ability to cope. i know this seems like an odd coincidence but i suspect that your five year old has the same behavior whether you are on your period or not. is is possible that you give her less personal attention during these times? five years olds are intuitive and may detect changes in your behavior and react accordingly."

    "Question": "when am i no longer contagious? i caught a cold then three days later developed bronchitis. i understand the cold has a three-day contagiousness window--one day before you know you are ill and two days following. but what happens when the cold develops into bronchitis? am i contagious again when the bronchitis symptoms appear? bottom line: when am i clear to return to work so i do not infect others?",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer bronchitis is just a complication of the cold. bronchitis itself is not contagious but you still should exercise caution when you cough use tissues etc. and wash your hands. you can return to work when you feel better and are fever-free since the cough can last a while. bronchitis caused by viruses are usually contagious. therefore you should be careful during acute episodes and even a few days after the symptoms subside. general measures of hygiene must be followed to prevent spread of contagious infections."

    "Question": "for the past few days i have been experiencing dizziness and slight pressure in my head is it anxiety related? . i was taking birth control but was having side effects so i stopped a few days ago. my symptoms tend to come and go a lot of the times i notice them when i am at work. when i am home relaxing the symptoms seem to go away. i do worry a lot and wonder if this could be anxiety related (i have been having tests done for possibly a risk of cervical cancer) or possibly still having side effects to my birth control.",
    "Answer": "this could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people. since your symptoms seem to improve when you're not at work and you've only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests i would suspect that anxiety could be the cause. it could also ironically be a side-effect from stopping (or starting) the birth control which can have physical side effects. you can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but i don't think you have too much to worry about."

    "Question": "i am 45 had tubal ligation 15 years ago and am 2 months late could i be pregnant? . my mother did not go in to menopause until her 60s. i have been under a lot of stress for the past two years. stopped taking all medication about 6 months ago (hbp antidepressant antipsychotic and one for headaches). my periods are irregular only in that they are heavy and painful and a few days off. (not weeks or months). i am scheduled for novasure procedure next week. if i am pregnant it would most likely be ectopic right?",
    "Answer": "tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure that renders you unable to get pregnant. in tubal ligation the fallopian tubes are cut or blocked which makes it impossible for a sperm to reach an egg or for an egg to reach the uterus. since you had a tubal ligation procedure it's not likely you're pregnant. that said you should call your health care provider's office before the novasure procedure to let them know your period is late. they will be able to advise you regarding what steps to take (such as whether or not they want you to take a pregnancy test). on a broader note i wanted to say i hope you did not discontinue your medications without the supervision of a health care provider. conditions like high blood pressure often don't clear up on their own. if you still have blood pressure or depression issues you would be well-advised to obtain medical treatment to ensure your health and well-being. best of luck to you! i had my tubal ligation almost 16 years ago. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant. believe me i was stunned! but the doctors said that it can happen and i am evidence of that. our daughter destiny grace will be joining us around august 27th and although there are some health concerns considering that i'm a 3 time cancer survivor and about to turn 40 we are expecting a healthy baby girl. it was not an tubal pregnancy she made it directly into the womb and has been there from the start! i have a friend and she had her tube tied for 17yrs. she got pregnant and couldn't belive it. neither could i her tube came untied. so yes you could be pregnant. you could be going through mood swing and hot flases and still be pregnant. no one do not know your body who are they to judge only god and mother nature know best. good luck! it is possible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation. especially if you had the tl during a c-section. the fail rate for a tubal ligation is around 1 percent but goes up after ten years or if you had the tl during a c-section. sometimes the tubes reattach themselves or a fistula forms. although tubal pregnancy rates are higher if you had a tl than if you didn't have the ligation it is not \"more likely\" that you will have a tubal pregnancy than a successful one. if you are pregnant it would not \"most likely be ectopic. \" it's simply more likely than if you had not had a tubal ligation but the odds are still in your favor. i believe the chances of a woman without a tubal ligation has a 1 in 400 chance of an ectopic pregnancy but now you might have a 1 in 100 chance. so the odds are still quite in your favor but technically you're \"4 times more likely than you were before\" the tubal ligation. make sense? if you had clips put on your fallopian tubes they can fall off. and ties can break. but it's rare. my guess is you are either entering menopause which is not a linear process for most of us. we stop our periods they come again and get off and on until finally they don't return. or your body is reacting to the medication changes. our bodies are more sensitive than we realize. when we moved and i was about 40 my body stopped having periods for nearly 7 months. then they suddenly resumed and never missed one since. now i'm 52 and i'm still having my periods regularly. if i were you i'd let myself wonder about pregnancy. but i'd think it's probably the third most likely possibility. (and an ectopic pregnancy will be looked at quickly. ) still missing that many months of your period if you are not having mood swings or hot flashes would get me to call my doctor just to check things out. good luck!"

    "Question": "what is lupus?",
    "Answer": "lupus is an autoimmune disease which means that the immune system mistakes the body's own tissues as foreign invaders and attacks them. some people with lupus suffer only minor inconvenience. others suffer significant lifelong disability. lupus affects people of african asian or native american descent three times as often as it affects whites. nine out of 10 people with lupus are women. the disease usually strikes between age 15 and 45 although it can occur in older individuals. there are two kinds of lupus: discoid lupus erythematosus (dle). systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). dle mainly affects skin that is exposed to sunlight and doesn’t typically affect vital internal organs. discoid (circular) skin lesions often leave scars after healing of the lesions. sle is more serious: it affects the skin and other vital organs and can cause a raised scaly butterfly-shaped rash across the bridge of the nose and cheeks that can leave scars if untreated. sle can also affect other parts of the skin elsewhere on the body. aside from the visible effects of systemic lupus the disease may also inflame and/or damage the connective tissue in the joints muscles and skin along with the membranes surrounding or within the lungs heart kidneys and brain. sle can also cause kidney disease. brain involvement is rare but for some lupus can cause confusion depression seizures and strokes. blood vessels may come under attack with systemic lupus. this can cause sores to develop on the skin especially the fingers. some lupus patients get raynaud's syndrome which makes the small blood vessels in the skin contract preventing blood from getting to the hands and feet -- especially in response to cold. most attacks last only a few minutes can be painful and often turn the hands and feet white or a bluish color. lupus patients with raynaud’s syndrome should keep their hands warm with gloves during cold weather."

    "Question": "removed mirena started birth control pills same day. had unprotected sex 3 days later. at risk for pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "yes you are at risk for pregnancy. changing contraceptives is a change of hormones (and all birth-control works differently) so while mirena may have worked by physically blocking sperm and thickening cervical mucous and hindering reproduction that way this new birth control may need time for the hormones to get into your blood stream. test for pregnancy when you get the chance and proceed from there."

    "Answer": "a new study links sleep disorders and sexual impotency. specifically the study examined the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and erectile dysfunction. osa afflicts more than 12 million americans and is characterized by repeated stops and starts of breathing during sleep when throat muscles relax and block the airway. left untreated those with sleep apnea suffer from poor quality sleep and chronic sleep deprivation leading to health issues that can be life-threatening: weight gain diabetes and cardiovascular problems. the study found that: men with erectile dysfunction were more than twice as likely to have osa than those without erectile dysfunction. the more severe the erectile dysfunction the greater the likelihood of having osa men with erectile dysfunction should probably be screened for osa yes"

    "Question": "how can i treat adult acne?",
    "Answer": "acne is not caused by dirty skin or by eating sweet or fried foods. acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. the worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly. one would think that as you age you would no longer have issues with acne. however women are especially prone to adult hormonal acne because your androgen levels fluctuate with your monthly cycle. other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. the women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. this form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. this becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin. keeping your face clean is a good beginning and you may want to turn to some of the many acne medications on the market but be aware that these are formulated for severe teen acne and will be very strong. if you wish to try these formulations try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. watch what you put on your face. steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate lanolin lauryl alcohol oleic acid vegetable butters oils and waxes. if over-the-counter acne solutions don't work for you you should make an appointment with your dermatologist. there are prescription medications that can be very helpful to you."

    "Answer": "a couple of years have gone by since the center for science in the public interest first filed a complaint against the parent company (coca-cola) that manufactures glaceau vitamin water. and now the washington-based national consumers league has joined in by filing a formal complaint with the federal trade commission calling advertising and labeling claims on vitamin water products “dangerously misleading. ” as if the “names” of the various vitamin water flavors like “revive ” “focus ” or “defense” weren’t misleading enough health claims made in advertising have ranged from “supporting optimal immune function” to “reducing the risk of age-related eye disease. ” hopefully we all know that fortifying sugar water with various vitamins and minerals isn’t really going to keep us from getting sick or reduce the risk of disease. the best thing we can do for most of these health concerns is to eat a healthful diet rich in whole foods and plant foods get plenty of rest and wash our hands frequently. for example vitamin water’s focus drink features “vitamin a and lutein ” according to the label on the bottle. if you want some lutein one of the antioxidant-acting carotenoid phytochemicals that has been mentioned in research lately just eat some dark green leafy veggies green peppers corn avocados oranges tomatoes or parsley! and instead of drinking their defense drink with vitamin c and zinc just eat an orange broccoli (and other dark leafy green veggies) brussels sprouts berries kiwi cantaloupe papaya or mango for the vitamin c and some lean meats crab nuts and whole grains for zinc. here’s what we do know about glaceau vitamin water: each 20-ounce bottle is labeled as containing 2. 5 servings crystalline fructose is the true main ingredient accounting for about 33 grams of sugar if you drink the whole bottle. each 20-ounce bottle totals 125 calories. the bottom line: keep your eyes open when it comes to manufactured products making health claims especially those fortified with nutrients. remember that the best water to drink is still good old h20 — not water pumped with 50 calories worth of sugar per eight-ounce serving."

    "Answer": "ivf is the most common type of art and there are other variations on the basic procedure some of which remain controversial. people should learn about both the benefits and risks of any medical procedure. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi): a single sperm is injected into an egg. if the egg is fertilized and develops normally it is then transferred to the uterus. this has been a significant advance in treating men with low sperm count or disorders related to sperm movement. couples who undergo the procedure should be aware that if their infertility is caused by a genetic defect that defect could be passed to the child. pre-implantation genetic diagnosis: an individual cell from a growing embryo is removed and used for genetic screening during ivf. blastocystculture: a blastocyst a developed embryo is cultured and transferred to the uterus after five or six days compared with the three days for typical in vitro fertilization. cryopreservation: human eggs and embryos are frozen so that they can be kept viable. they are stored in liquid nitrogen at 320 degrees below zero. assisted hatching: an opening is created in the egg shell surrounding the embryo to help it implant in the uterus. this procedure has not been shown to be beneficial for everyone undergoing art. those who may benefit from assisted hatching include couples who have preserved embryos their own or donated by cryopreservation couples in which the mother is of an advanced age or couples with a history of multiple failed ivf attempts. the fda does not regulate individual art procedures but the agency has cleared devices for use in art procedures. examples are biopsy devices dissection needles sperm and embryo delivery catheters and solutions used to process and maintain sperm eggs and embryos."

    "Question": "can fibromyalgia cause muscles to tear more easily?",
    "Answer": "based on my experience over the years i think fm makes our muscles more susceptible to strains or tears/injuries within the muscles. also we seem to be more susceptible to getting tendinitis and bursitis. some of this may be due to certain deficiencies that we with fibro develop like low intracellular magnesium levels low muscle energy (atp) and low growth hormone levels that interfere with the protection flexibility and recovery of the muscles and soft tissues. our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative \"wear and tear\" changes we all get with aging and overuse. also our muscles act more \"deconditioned\" when we have fm which increases our chance of an injury. fm doesn't cause/aggravate disc disease or arthritis changes but the reverse situation is true. that is disc and arthritic disease can aggravate fm symptoms. i don't believe in automatically attributing any soft tissue problem to fm. in fact most of the times something else like a trauma or a degenerative problem is \"clearly\" identified as the direct cause of the tear or bursitis/tendinitis. but we can surmise that the fm probably played a secondary role in a lot of these situations. no i dont believe so"

    "Answer": "hi put any sperm anywhere near a vagina and yes you could get pregnant. ok so you b/f ejectulated on your leg yes and then had some on his fingers and he then fingered you yes then you could get pregnant. ok as you have not said when this happened if it was within the last 24 hours then if you go out and by yourself a plan b you have a 72 hour window in which to take it from the time it happened. so drag you b/f down to your local drug store and get him to get his money out and pay for it tell him its a lot cheaper than paying for the baby. do hop[e this helps you and your b/f. good luck"

    "Answer": "millions of people have latent antibodies that show they have had some form of herpes in the past. on the lips (cold sores fever blisters) in the genital areas chicken pox (also a herpes virus) or shingles (herpes zoster). while you may be able to be dna lab tested to see if you have these specific antibodies it would not necessarily show the type of herpes you had when you may have contracted it or if you are now are considered a person with a dormant form of herpes. basically once you have the herpes virus. you will always have it. since her post herpes infection was \"self-diagnosed\" you may have been wrong."

    "Question": "do i burn calories while i’m sleeping?",
    "Answer": "sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed. and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep. during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage. in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake. this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose – the basic building block of most foods. in order to sleep better and lose weight: lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed. use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep. don’t use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep! take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day. drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol 3 hours before your bed time alarm goes off. alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed. work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed. have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re-set your internal biological clock. sleep loss affects weight loss — from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make. start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer so sorry you're going through this. it sounds scary. even if your blood sugar levels tested normal during a routine lab test that doesn't mean you're not having episodes of hypoglycemia. when you say \"my sugar levels are normal when checked \" i'm assuming you're talking about a lab test. have you ever used a hand-held glucometer to have someone check your sugar level when you experience one of these shaking/sweating/passing out episodes? the reason your doctor specifically said to eat something sugary when this happens is to rapidly raise your low blood sugar levels. it's not enough to eat just anything when these episodes occur. carry a candy bar or something very sugary with you to eat when you start to feel these symptoms coming on. passing out for over an hour can indicate dangerously low blood sugar levels. you should not allow that to continue. if you experience an episode like this again and your friends cannot rouse you (wake you up) they need to call 911 immediately. i would strongly recommend going back to the doctor to have your symptoms reevaluated if eating sugar isn't helping when you have one of these episodes. by the way your blood pressure and pulse numbers look very good which is why your doctor wasn't concerned. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "is there any cure for premature ejaculation? i am 28 male and ejaculate within 2 mins. i am not at all satisfied.",
    "Answer": "early ejaculation is probably one of the most common sexual problems in men. depending on how you define this condition some studies have found that up to 30% of men suffer from premature ejaculation at some point in their lives. the exact cause of premature ejaculation is not known and treatments focus on the behavioral psychological and medical aspects. here's a lineup of some of the treatments that are available: antidepressants- some can cause a delay in ejaculation. these medications include paxil or zoloft lidocaine creams and other desensitizing creams prolong the time to ejaculation. desensitizing lubricants are available over the counter. the squeeze method developed by masters and johnsons or the stop and start technique are also employed to help with premature ejaculation and help prolong sexual activity. if premature ejaculation causes you anxiety its important to meet with a mental health counselor. seek medical help for early ejaculation since these treatments may help you but part of the treatment plan should be to have a sustained and satisfying sex life. what is ejaculation? ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis following sexual climax. when a man is sexually stimulated the brain sends signals to the genital area through nerves in the spinal cord to contract the pelvic muscles. at the start of this process waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm with a small amount of fluid from the testes through to the vas deferens. the seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. this mixture of fluid and sperm travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is released (ejaculated) at the time of sexual climax (orgasm). doctormens. com you need to put your focus into your woman instead of constantly thinking and worrying about your penis. muscle programs are often activated by our thoughts so if you worry and imagine yourself ejaculating you will lose control and ejaculate. keep in mind that your conscious mind can only focus on one subject at a time. hi! i am 33 years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy 3 bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after 6 weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link> hi! i am 31 years old. premature ejaculation is more common than you think. up to 40% of all males experience this in their life-time. i personally overcame my issues with premature ejaculation by following these very helpful tips. if interested please click here: <link> i hope it helps you as well as it did for me."

(gastroesophageal reflux disease). symptoms of heart disease can also feel like heartburn. make an appointment with your doctor. he or she can find out what is causing your symptoms and help you get relief. for more information check out the webmd heartburn/gerd health center"

    "Answer": "your body prob got use to the workout. that happened to me and i workout with my dad for a while. i noticed i wasn't pushing myself and doing certain things right. maybe find a trainer and ask them to show you some pointers. that helped me a lot. i wouldn't suggest diet pills. i don't know why i am against those but i haven't found any that doesn't have a lot of caffeine in it. i've read some labels say not to consume any other caffeine from coffee or tea. i'm a huge coffee drinker. maybe you need to cut more things out of your diet. maybe you didn't take enough things out. for instance i was a fast food junky b/c i'm always busy and i had to stop eating out and that helped me lose more. hopefully that helped. i'm not a professional. just speaking based off my personal experience."

    "Question": "i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure. is this linked to menopause?",
    "Answer": "there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging."

    "Question": "my dad has chronic hiccups for the last 2 months every 5 seconds. nothing has worked from his doctor. specialist? . a couple years ago he had prostate surgery. they caught the cancer early and were able to remove it. he's changed his diet to bring down his cholesterol and blood pressure. he's 5'6\" 150 pounds. his doctors has prescribed him medication liquids but nothing has worked and it's even worse today. i don't know if there's a specialist that handles this type of thing. there isn't much information online about it. what should be the next step here? where do we start?",
    "Answer": "start with a gastroenterologist. in many cases this can be \"fixed\" with a combination of medications and even surgery. i have had bouts with chronic hiccups my entire life until i found a permanent over-the-counter medicine that cured them for me and keep me from ever getting them anymore (and i am in my mid-40's). i would get the hiccups for 1 to 4 days which would lead to other problems with the spasms flaring up my ulcer. i am not a doctor but i know it works for me and improved my quality of life 100%. the named-brand medicine is not labeled for a hiccup cure and the only main ingredient is what does the job for me. every day i take just one time-released tablet of just plain mucinex (blue and white box) made by reckitt benckiser. although it is designed to work as an expectorant to relieve chest congestion and it thins and loosens mucus it does a whole lot more for me. the main ingredient guaifenesin (600 mg) is what stopped my hiccups when i last had them mid-2012 and i have been taking one or two 12-hour tablets daily ever since. if you get another brand it will probably not be time released so be careful as it may work for 4 hours at the most. i hope this helps and please let me know if it does because it sure changed my life. my dad is having the same problem. did your dad's condition improved? if so can you please share what he did?"

    "Question": "how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy."

    "Question": "why can’t i drink before bed if it makes me fall asleep faster?",
    "Answer": "well alcohol does a bunch of different things to you while you’re sleeping. so while it may help you fall asleep it will keep you in the lighter stages of sleep and remember that’s not the best sleep for you. it will also wake you up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. it will also dehydrate you which can affect your sleep. so when you ingest alcohol before you go to bed and it makes you stay in the light stages one and two sleep again you’re not getting that three and four sleep which is where we see the increase in growth hormone where we see the cell repair where we see the overall damage from the day repair. nor do you wake up and feel refreshed. so when you deprive somebody of stages three and four sleep and you wake them up what they tell you is they feel like they’ve never slept. and that’s that really fatigued horrible feeling that people would feel in the morning. so alcohol can cause that. half the reason that people have a hangover is from the sleep deprivation. the other half of the reason is from dehydration. now i don’t have a problem with having a glass or two or wine with dinner. but what i do have a problem with is people having 4 or 5 glasses of wine with dinner and then having sleep problems. so if you’re regularly taking alcohol to help you sleep that’s not a particularly effective methodology for helping you fall asleep nor is it particularly good for you."

    "Answer": "attempting to lose a large amount of weight quickly is potentially dangerous and will set you up for a disappointing failure. my plan would be for you to lose 3 pounds per week by following these steps: lose the pounds talk with your family doctor before stating any weight reduction/exercise program; your daily caloric intake goal should be 1 727 consisting of 55% carbs 15% protein and 30% fats; find a 1 700 calorie diet on the web that appeals to your taste preferences (you’ll be more likely to follow-through if you feel satisfied); the diet should consist of varied main course meals and snacks; drink water before eating your meal and use a smaller size dinner plate; eat with others and ask for your family’s support. perhaps someone else will diet with you; join a dieting support group; do not skip meals; exercise moderately; patiently work your plan; find a follow-up diet that will keep the weight off after reaching your goal. stretch mark removal some stretch marks will be reduced just by losing the excess weight. next exfoliate the scarred areas in a rapid fashion with your hands to reduce out-of-control scar tissue growth by using mechanical massage equipment and your hands. follow the exfoliation treatment with nutritional therapy by applying conditioners to restore normal tissue regrowth. stay hydrated and apply protective sun screen on a regular basis. by setting up a plan for success and remaining laser focused with a positive attitude you’ll lose the excess weight and eliminate the scars within 5-6 months. the time will go fast and the rewards are worth the wait. it is better to do your transformation slowly and to be successful the first time than to take short cuts resulting in multiple failures. best wishes for your success."

    "Question": "what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?",
    "Answer": "one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin."

    "Answer": "since you are checking your own blood sugar i am assuming that you are either a diabetic or have a glucose monitor in order to determine if you are. a blood sugar of 600 is very very high so you will need to consult your medical provider immediately for treatment. treatment may include insulin oral diabetic medications and of course dietary management. if you have never had a blood sugar this high before you need to seek medical care so this can be rectified. an er or urgent care facility can help."

    "Answer": "i just turned 60 and am now 7 years post emergency bypass surgery. if you are perfectly comfortable playing squash with your heart rate that high not out of breath not breathing hard or panting no chest pain then you simply have fantastic fitness. its a whole body activity utilizing legs and tush as you move about the floor and back and ab muscles as you lean in all directions to move for the ball and start and stop. just be sure you eat a very healthy diet plenty of anti-oxidant rich foods every day and keep a lid on saturated fats in the diet. with a bad diet your heart can develop an alternative capillary network that feeds it as major arteries become blocked from bad diet with good exercise. this does not happen to every one but i have this and i know of a fellow about 60 miles away who does also. he also recently had bypass surgery."

    "Question": "what are platelets?",
    "Answer": "platelets are cell fragments derived from bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes. platelets circulate in blood but are much smaller than red or white blood cells. platelets are coated with substances that normally glide smoothly along the surface of blood vessels and other blood cells. however when platelets encounter a damaged blood vessel they collect together in a plug to stop the bleeding. a blood clot then forms sealing the platelet plug. aspirin and other medicines like clopidogrel (plavix) interfere with platelets’ ability to clump together. this helps protect against the sudden formation of blood clots inside blood vessels (the cause of heart attacks and strokes). antiplatelet drugs also increase the likelihood of abnormal or excessive bleeding."

    "Question": "how can stevia help with diabetes?",
    "Answer": "stevia is a natural sugar substitute that belongs in your “diabetes reversal” bag of tricks. [many] medical problems [are] fueled by excess sugar including obesity type 2 diabetes heart disease metabolic syndrome and many other weight-related medical problems. i believe stevia can be a significant part of the solution for many individuals. the key advantage of stevia (over artificial sweeteners) is that it is all natural – it comes from the “sweetleaf” plant that grows primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of western north america to south america. the leaves contain the sweet glycosides stevioside and rebaudioside (discovered in 1931 by french chemists) which are 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). the leaves themselves taste sweet and can be used whole or in ground form in food and beverages. more typically the sweet glycosides are extracted from the plant material and sold as a processed powder. some companies sell stevia liquid resulting from dissolving the powder into a liquid which might also contain additional flavor enhancements. stevia’s taste is on par with other sugar substitutes – sweetness with a mild after-taste. the key to leveraging stevia’s sweetening power is by masking the after-taste which is easy to do. stevia shines when used to enhance the sweetness of foods or beverages that already have some flavor as well as another source of mild sweetness. its use in the popular beverages vitamin water zero and sobe life water demonstrate that it is gaining traction in the united states. it is usually available as powder packets or concentrated liquid in supermarkets natural foods markets vitamin shops and health food stores. its availability and popularity vary from country to country. it is especially popular in japan where it has been in commercial use for nearly 40 years. it is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of asia and in australia and i believe it will become increasingly popular in the united states and europe as well. i use it instead of honey sugar date or splenda in fruit smoothies. without the stevia it tastes bland and cries out for some sweetness. it tastes great with the stevia and there is no after-taste since the fruit masks it. here are two favorite recipes: banana strawberry smoothies 1/2 banana (frozen) 4 strawberries (frozen) 1 cup water 5 drops liquid stevia chocolate peanut butter banana shake 1 banana (frozen chunks) 2 teaspoons natural peanut butter 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 12 ounces water 10 drops stevia my kids and i love these! there is nothing in there i’d hesitate to call healthy. another example: my 4-year old is much happier to drink milk when it has 3 drops of stevia added. if you have kids that will only drink milk if it is sweetened (eg. with chocolate syrup) but you don’t want them consuming so much sugar then stevia drops are your answer. . a 2-ounce bottle of liquid stevia. provides about 250 servings (equivalent to about 500 teaspoons of sugar or over 50 twelve-ounce cans of soda). this saves over 8000 calories with no effect on blood sugar!"

    "Answer": "most helpful answer well there is pretty much zero statistical probability that an abdominal x-ray could miss an 8-month fetus. could an abdominal x-ray miss an 8-week embryo? it's possible if the radiologist or other health care provider wasn't looking specifically for an embryo or fetus. but even at that any abnormality on an x-ray probably would be picked up. abdominal x-ray is not how pregnancies are confirmed. the \"gold standard\" for confirming a pregnancy is the pelvic ultrasound. as to what's going on well it's difficult to say. you may be experiencing a false pregnancy. but that's just a wild guess since i don't know anything about your health history. i'd suggest you sit down with your ob-gyn and ask for a detailed explanation of the results of your abdominal exam and x-ray. wishing you all the best!"

    "Question": "is oatmeal good for diabetes?",
    "Answer": "i personally have never liked the taste or texture of oatmeal. this is unexpected because i like the taste of almost all foods i have ever tried. oatmeal tastes ok to me only if it is loaded with brown sugar and cinnamon etc. i love the taste of cold cereal and i would eat if every day for breakfast if i could justify it. but i can't because of the carbohydrate load. the very high-fiber cereals seem more reasonable to me but i'd rather eat other things personally. professionally i generally try to steer my patients away from oatmeal and high-fiber cereals during the period of time that they are trying to lose weight and reduce their a1c. i do steer them toward other breakfast options such as low-fat cottage cheese fruit greek yogurt light yogurt lean breakfast meats (canadian bacon turkey ham etc. ) soy sausages eggs (especially egg whites) and homemade protein shakes (100 calories of protein powder plus 100 calories from milk almond milk or fruit). we bring back the oatmeal and high-fiber cereals once they are in maintenance mode. i believe i am in the minority when it comes to my views on oatmeal and high-fiber cereal however my concern is the high carbohydrate load. i am suspicious of whole grains and believe they interfere with weight loss and a1c reduction unless the dietary fat intake is very low in which case i encourge eating these foods. the instant oatmeal is pretty highly processed in order to get it to cook so quickly. i believe the research supporting oatmeal consumption is suspect. there are clearly much worse foods one could eat but there are better ones too. i am a type 2 diabetic myself and love oats. however the doctor is right about highly processed cereals. their are far better grains to eat. if you like oatmeal try cooking steel cut oats. they are almost totally unprocessed and the gi is lower another thing you do not have to load your oatmeal with sugars or sweeteners to enhance the taste! simply add stevia and if you like brown sugar add 1/2 tsp unsulphered molasses with the stevia. the most important thing to keep oats from spiking your blood sugars is to eat a good fat or protein with it such as almond butter or even whey powder. this stops the spike cold. also do not eat a fruit at the same time as the startchy carbs. this accelorates the spike. instead eat a fruit as soon as you get up and the carbs (oats) at least 1/2 to1 hr later. if you don't have this time skip the fruit till snack time between breakfast and lunch! this works for me very well. eating this way raises my blood sugar around 20_35 points total on my post meal check! without the protein or fat and fruit at the same time the sugars would be 75_150 higher! i enjoy otameal periodically but because of the carb content it's not an everyday thing. i use 1/3 cup of oatmeal with 2/3 cup of skim milk or plain soy milk depending on what's available and my mood. avoid sweetened versions of soy milk at all cost. they're all loaded with sugar which defeats the whole purpose. i've learned that i can sweeten it with a couple packets of splenda in lieu of brown sugar add some pieces of pecans and a small amount of margarine (i personally like \" i can't believe it's not butter\" ) for taste. although oatmeal has some carbs it also is high in fiber which helps manage carbohydrate and cholesterol issues and it makes a nice breakfast while providing a little variety in the diet. i do not know it raised my blood glucose after consumption yes"

    "Answer": "cervical cancer may have an underlying cause such as hpv (human papilloma virus) but i would have no idea if this man also has hpv. herpes is an entirely different type of infection that does not cause cervical cancer but can be transmitted to you during sex. a condom would offer a reasonable (but not 100%) protection against herpes. there are different strains of hpv. some of them cause cervical cancer and some of them cause genital warts. if his wife's cervical cancer was caused by hpv (most cases are) then he most certainly had or has a serious form of hpv. the herpes diagnosis is a completely separate issue. please keep in mind that hpv (and maybe herpes but i don't know about that) can be spread by contact with areas that are not covered by a condom. it can also be spread by oral or anal sex."

    "Answer": "conversations between dr and patient are confidential and protected. telling your doctor that you may have a substance abuse problem and asking for help will most likely result in the suggestion and encouragement to enter rehab; however your doctor cannot force you to go. although in most cases cocaine abuse does not require detox most individuals who use cocaine also have other substance abuse including alcohol prescription painkillers and illicit drugs. in this case medical detox treatment can help them remove all the toxic chemicals related to their substance abuse from their body. after substance abuse detox treatment most people benefit from going through a rehab program or participating in behavioral therapy. substance abuse is more than a surface activity and usually stems from some deeper issue. a rehab program or counseling service will be able to help the individual get to the bottom of their cocaine use and help them resolve the issues. groups such as 12- step groups and other non-traditional non-12 step programs offer support within the community. these programs offer suggestions and explanations on how to avoid relapse. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Question": "how can you remove a condom that could possibly be stuck inside your buttocks? . i am not 100% sure if it is still inside me as i had gone to the bathroom and was not able to see if it came out. please help. would i still feel it? what would it feel like? will it come out by itself? how long would that take? im scared.",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer having a retained object in the rectum is no laughing matter. i understand why you'd feel scared. women face similar feelings about retaining tampons so you definitely are not alone. if you're very concerned that the condom is still inside you your best bet is to seek medical attention. let me assure you any health care professional worth their salt will treat your problem with dignity and concern. you need not feel embarrassed about this. if an otherwise healthy person were constipated and retaining stool in the rectum the obvious answer would be to use a liquid-based laxative such as magnesium citrate or polyethylene glycol (brand name miralax). however anyone with any medical condition compromised immune system or dehydration should not use these preparations without medical supervision. if you experience any abdominal bloating vomiting or fever please seek medical attention immediately. good luck to you! your best bet is to bend over and have a friend or loved one use a vacuum tool to remove the item within the anus. goodluck! hey i am experiencing the same thing at the moment. e and my ex partner had intercourse and he got the condom stuck up me and i had my fingers up me trying to pull it out and i could feel that it was there but feel as if i did not remove it at the time it happened and now that i look in this time its not there when i am thinking to myself and am pretty sure i didn't remove it at the time it happened and now i don't know how to remove it because it was in the time it happened. um if i think of anything i will let you know."

    "Answer": "it is time to see a sub-specialist (a otoneurologist -- an ent that specializes in inner ear disorders) and have a new work-up. there are numerous types of vertigo so it would be good to have a new evaluation. things may have changed since you were ten. unfortunately there are not very many things that can be done but there are more treatments and medications out there depending the type of vertigo that you have. i have seen an ent many times. never find anything. i've found the epley maneuver to be helpful. there are several youtube videos that show how to do the maneuver (you need another person to help you) but i found this one by peter johns <link> to be very helpful. it may not work the first time but it should eventually work unless you have something major causing your vertigo. if it's been a long time since you've had an mri you may want to have another one done just to be sure there's nothing ominous causing your dizziness. i know it's frustrating; i've had to leave work early and have missed days of work because of vertigo. i'm a high school teacher and am always busy busy busy but taking care of ourselves is important. i find that when i'm extremely tired and stressed that's when it tends to hit. good luck!"

    "Answer": "just get him to drink more. not just milk (which can be constipating in some children). the lack of bowel movement is not concerning as long as he is acting fine. when you are not drinking sufficient fluids the body actually pulls water from the colon to use (not the bladder). there may not be any \"extra\" fluid for him to urinate so this is why you need to really encourage good hydration today. signs of dehydration in children would include dry eyes (no tears) and a dry mouth (no saliva). if he has wet eyes and mouth you can just hang in there a bit longer and see if increased fluids today will help. popsicles commercially-available electrolyte solutions jello ice chips etc. all can entice a toddler to hydrate."

    "Answer": "obviously teenagers with epilepsy date just like anyone else. but often they worry about telling dates that they have epilepsy. your daughter may not want to tell her boyfriend. your son may not want girls to know. in the end the decision is up to each teen but you should encourage your child to be honest and open. when your child enters a serious relationship it's important for the other person to know about epilepsy. otherwise your child's boyfriend or girlfriend could be upset and frightened during a seizure. one potentially awkward issue that you may want to bring up with your daughter is pregnancy. you may think it's too early to have this talk but it's probably not. teenagers with epilepsy may begin to wonder whether they'll be able to have a normal family and whether their condition may cause problems with pregnancy. the facts are reassuring: most women with epilepsy have healthy children. however epilepsy does increase some of the risks. also some epilepsy drugs may cause birth defects and others decrease the effectiveness of birth control. so it's particularly important that women with epilepsy plan for pregnancy."

    "Question": "while taking amoxicillin trihydrate can i drink?",
    "Answer": "the appropriate answer for me to give is this: you shouldn't drink while taking a prescription medication including antibiotics. some medical professionals feel any drinking at all is unhealthy though i am not in that camp. while i certainly would never encourage someone to drink while taking an antibiotic the truth is studies show alcohol consumption does not reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics. however combining alcohol with antibiotics like penicillin can increase the severity of side effects such as drowsiness dizziness and nausea. a few antibiotics must never be taken with alcohol. these are: metronidazole (flagyl) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (bactrim) and tinidazole (tindamax). combining these antibiotics with alcohol can cause serious severe side effects including tachycardia (racing heart). by the way when it comes to drinking and antibiotics alcohol is alcohol. in other words it doesn't matter if you're drinking a beer or a shot of tequila. to the body all alcohol is created equal. your best bet is to lay off the booze until the antibiotics are finished. and don't forget to take all of the penicillin you were prescribed. don't quit taking it if you start to feel better before finishing the course. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "we know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time. but often patients don’t know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere. so we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if you’re taking any of these please stop or let’s talk about. and we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and non-prescription medications. we are trying to make sure the patient doesn’t forget or doesn’t disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia. there are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didn’t know the patient were taking. but it’s not just supplements and prescriptions. what about foods? well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it. we tell people those things that would get them into trouble. by the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising. when you see a bruise it’s because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them. so you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us. but we need to know. this is the most important thing. and this is why it’s so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks. we don’t want anything slipping through the cracks. an anesthesiologist’s worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didn’t know about and that drug was in the patient’s system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic."

    "Answer": "first great job on taking steps to help control your diabetes through diet. it's not easy and you should be congratulated for taking this step. gluten is a protein found in wheat and related grains (including spelt barley rye and others). i don't know of any studies that look specifically at a gluten-free diet for diabetes management. historically people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance have needed to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle. today many people have decided to give gluten-free a try whether for weight loss or to see if it helps conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. these connections are still being investigated and there's no conclusive scientific evidence yet that eating gluten-free is beneficial to anyone other than those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. if you do decide to try living a gluten-free lifestyle remember you still need to get an adequate amount of fiber and whole grains in your diet. if you opt to eliminate wheat and related grains you need to replace them with other whole grains such as brown rice. while there's no evidence that eating gluten-free aids in weight loss or is advantageous for any medical conditions beyond celiac disease it's also not a harmful way to eat. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "mirena is an effective birth control method that works in two ways: hormonal and as an iud. basically it is blocking implantation of a fertilized ovum in the uterus. it is not a sperm assasin. the human body is designed for conception and the female body does not kill sperm. sperm live a very short life and will die off in about a week after being deposited in the female genital tract. while the enviroment may always be overly-welcoming to the invasion of sperm and many will die in their journey the female body doesn't intend on killing the."

    "Answer": "hot flashes are a huge factor for women when they sleep. uh i had one patient call them power surges where in the middle of the night she just had all of this heat and all of this energy and had a really tough time going back to bed. believe it or not there are some interesting products on the market that are pretty cool for this. there are these things called wicking pajamas. now this is very similar to the dry fit or the things that you see the athletes wear but it actually works much the way a wick does. so a wick in a candle actually pulls the wax up into the wick otherwise if you lit the wick it would just burn straight through the candle. so these wicking pajamas are actually quite effective. there are other things that you can do. believe it or not there’s a device out there a chillable pillow that you can use and there’s an insert that you put into it and it allows for because remember you lose most of your heat through your head and that’s where you feel a lot of your heat to again maintain sort of a constant temperature. but if your hormones go kooky you’re going to have a hot flash whether you like it or not. the same process is done with these wicking pajamas is it pulls the sweat off of you then there’s a second layer that’s got a very large surface area and allows the sweat to evaporate so women aren’t waking up in soaking wet clothing being cold. because what happens is they get this hot flash or power surge they begin to sweat to reduce that temperature and then all of a sudden their clothing is wet and they’ve already made their bedroom as cold as humanly possible and then they get the shakes or they get the shivers and they are not feeling so great."

    "Answer": "he probably does have it so it would be best if you both are treated. a false negative test is not uncommon. don't worry about where you got it (one of your non-condom-wearing sexual partners gave it to you; that is for sure). if you both get treated you should both be clear as long as no one strays. to be on the same side it would be best for your partner to use a condom from now on since honest in sexual relationship are often suspect."

    "Answer": "hi here is some info from the uks daily mails doctor. your concern that it might have affected your fertility is a valid one and needs to be checked out if you don't fall pregnant soon. chlamydia infection can affect the fallopian tubes in a couple of ways. it might lead to the formation of scar tissue in the pelvis which physically blocks the tubes either by kinking or binding the tube down. the infection may also damage the fine hairs which line the inside of the tube and ensure the egg moves down to the uterus. depending on the contraception you used previously it can take a few months for regular ovulation to start up again so you may not have been actually able to fall pregnant for as long as a year. why not discuss this with your gp? he or she would be able to make the appropriate referral to get your tubes checked and start the ball rolling if you don't fall pregnant soon. ok looking at that it would be a good idea to see your doctor and get some tests done. you can get tests done on your tubes they can go in for a looksee who knows your tubes could be blocked that's just a thought. hope you find away. good luck"

    "Answer": "what you describes sounds like it may be the labia minora. most often they are described as flat and reddish folds; in women that have had children these structures can extend beyond the outer labia & cause no reason to be concerned. however since this is something that you've recently noticed & you describe as being dark or black in color i'd recommend that you see your gynecologist and get it evaluated. a simple vaginal exam is all that is needed to confirm this is the labia minora and nothing more serious."

    "Question": "what do i need to know about sunscreens and sun blocks?",
    "Answer": "often i am posed with questions about the significance of the sun protection factor (spf) number. there is an assumption that the higher the spf number the more protected you'll be from the sun. but you need not seek the highest spf available because beyond an spf of 30 you will be getting little additional protection. the american academy of dermatology recommends using sunscreen that has an spf of 30 or greater that protects against uva and uvb rays and that's water resistant. it is important to know that uvb rays are those that cause bad sunburns and are associated with skin cancer. uva rays tend to be the culprit for skin aging but can also influence the development of skin cancer just not as ambitiously. therefore i recommend using a product that protects against both uvb and uva rays. it's important to know what happens to your sunscreen when you get in the water. water will dilute sunscreen so you'll need to reapply it reasonably often. the recommendation is that a water resistant sunscreen be reapplied after 40 minutes spent in a swimming pool or the ocean. sunscreens that claim to be waterproof tend to be a little heavier and more oily and should keep you protected for up to 80 minutes. the difference between sunscreen and sun block is that sunscreen protects your skin by absorbing and reflecting uv rays. sun block reflects and scatters uvb rays and creates a barrier between your skin and the sun. remember that the sun allows the body to perform a self-conversion for vitamin d which is essential for the calcium metabolism that impacts the strength of your bones. vitamin d is very important and in fact may be critical in the prevention of certain cancers."

    "Question": "how do you care for an open wound after basal cell cancer surgery on your scalp? . the dr. was not able to completely stitch together the opening left and decided to leave it heal on its own. they stitched together what they could and there is an opening about an inch by 1/3 of an inch big still. being a working woman i need to wash my hair to go to work. how is this cared for a cleaned. also how long does it typically take to heal to the point it does not need a dressing or bandage? .",
    "Answer": "for the most accurate information you should call your surgeon's office and ask to speak to the nurse. he or she can advise you as to what post-op care your surgeon prefers. generally speaking it should be ok to shampoo normally. be careful not to catch a suture with your comb or brush. (ouch! ) assuming you're not allergic to any medications you're probably safe to apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound (such as a generic \"triple antibiotic ointment\") for a few days. after that you're probably safe to use a+d ointment (which does not contain antibiotics) to promote healing. this ointment is usually found on the diaper rash aisle of any grocery store or drug store. you shouldn't apply any hair product to the area (like mousse or hairspray) and you shouldn't blow-dry the area right around the wound. it's very hard to keep a bandage on a wound that's surrounded by hair and you may not need to keep this covered. if you work with the public (especially with children such as in daycare or school setting or if you work in retail or handle money) then i'd suggest you try to keep the wound covered to avoid allowing germs in. however if you work in an office environment for example you're probably ok to leave the wound uncovered. this shouldn't affect its healing as long as you keep it moist with either the antibiotic ointment or a+d until it scabs over. no matter what wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you touch or bandage your wound. the wound should scab over within a week or so and it will continue healing for up to a few weeks. once a scab is in place you no longer need to apply any ointment or a bandage. as i said these are general guidelines only. your surgeon may have different preferences and you should consult him or her for instructions. i wish you all the best!"

    "Question": "can any advertised device reduce my sagging skin?",
    "Answer": "a friend from long island and thus always a great skeptic sent me an advertisement from an airline magazine. apparently the face trainer is a helmet-mask device that “works out facial muscles for a natural looking lip. ” the advertisement says “no creams no injections no fuss – just 10 minutes a day and your face trainer is all you need to look younger and healthier. ” the advertisement further states “in a 60-day clinical trial participants achieved 71% reduction in sagging skin. ” i found that quite amazing but i’m not sure what the “clinical trial” was. i wonder if i asked for a copy of this clinical trial if they would have one for me. i certainly did not see anything about it in a recognized medical journal. if any product were that good you can bet i would know about it by now. i wish life was that easy where all we had to do was wear a device and somehow our anatomy magically changes. our skin would look younger become tighter and all sags and bags would just go away. wow! this would be real progress. sometimes i find these types of advertisements offensive because they demean the intelligence of the reader. despite the proclamation that products like this will “give your face a lift without needles or knives ” don’t expect a miracle. and those well-chosen words “without needles or knives” are deliberately crafted by the writer of the ad to incite terror in the reader’s brain. to scare you so that you make the emotional part of your brain believe this device can do what the common sense part of your brain says it cannot do. remember when something seems too good to be true it usually is."

    "Question": "had a mole removed an now its red an very itchy. the mole was on my forearm. my doctor burned it off. now it is red an very itchy. whats causing it to do that?",
    "Answer": "assuming you had this mole removed recently i'd say the redness and itching are a normal part of the healing process. as the body heals a wound (in this case the one caused by having the mole burned off) it employs several types of cells and chemical compounds to repair the skin layers that have been damaged. during that process a chemical compound called histamine can be released. histamine can cause itching. along similar lines the redness can be caused by various cells and the body's chemical response to the wound. it's important you not scratch this patch of skin while it's healing. if you pull the scab off a scar can form. it's ok to rub the area with the flat of your hand. if you're concerned about scratching during your sleep put socks on your hands! i know it sounds wacky but it will keep you from accidentally scratching your face with a fingernail while you sleep. the itching and redness should calm down as the days pass. if the redness and itching get worse you can put a call in to your doctor's office and speak with the nurse to find out what to do. good luck!"

    "Question": "exactly what does it mean when states are not expanding medicaid?",
    "Answer": "as originally drafted the affordable care act required every state to expand its medicaid program for all adults up to 138% of the poverty level (roughly $15 900 in annual income for a single person household). prior to the affordable care act many states' medicaid programs covered only the poorest of the poor adults. complementing the medicaid expansion the affordable care act made federal subsidies available to people who made too much to qualify for medicaid but still had income low enough that insurance premiums were unaffordable. the supreme court struck down the requirement for states to expand medicaid and instead made it optional. there is still a significant incentive for states to expand - the federal government will pay all the costs of the expansion for the first 3 years - but a number of states have decided against the medicaid expansion. in those states people who are between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level can still get a premium subsidy to buy a private policy but people below 100% and do not qualify for medicaid will not receive any assistance."

    "Answer": "for the majority of children suffering hair loss one of the following conditions is the cause. your child's pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist should be able to diagnose these conditions and prescribe the appropriate treatment. tinea capitis. tinea capitis commonly known as ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection often seen in children. it can show up in a number of ways but often as scaly patches of hair loss on the head. the patches are usually round or oval. the hairs may be broken off at the surface of the skin and look like black dots on the scalp. because ringworm is contagious your child should be careful not to share any objects that touch the head such as hats pillow cases or brushes. alopecia areata. alopecia areata is a non-contagious condition of hair loss thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. it is characterized by the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. the patches are slick or smooth without scaling or broken hairs. about 25% of children also have pitting and ridging of the nails. while there is no cure for alopecia areata treatment can control the disease in some children. many have their hair back within a year although regrowth is unpredictable and many will lose hair again. for about 5% of children the disease progresses to alopecia totalis -- loss of all of the hair on the scalp. some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- a total loss of body hair. trichotillomania. trichotillomania is hair loss caused by pulling plucking twisting or rubbing. the hair loss is patchy and characterized by broken hairs of varying length. patches are typically seen on the side of the child's dominant hand. trichotillomania may be triggered by a stressor in your child's life such as the loss of a grandparent birth of a sibling or a divorce. if you notice your child pulling hair scolding will not likely be helpful. however counseling to help your child deal with the source of stress that triggered the habit may help stop it. telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a condition in which a sudden or severe stress -- such as extremely high fever surgery under general anesthesia the death of a loved one a severe injury or the use of certain prescription medications -- interrupts the normal cycle of hair growth. the hair follicles stop growing prematurely and enter a resting phase (called the telogen phase). between six and 16 weeks later hair sheds excessively leading to partial or complete baldness. there are no conclusive tests to diagnose telogen effluvium; there is also no treatment for it. however once the stressful event is over full hair growth usually returns within six months to a year. nutritional deficiency. though less common hair loss can be a symptom of deficiencies in certain nutrients including: vitamin h or biotin one of the b complex of vitamins which help the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose to fuel the body. zinc an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism. it also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy childhood and adolescence. in some cases hair loss can be a symptom of too much vitamin a. with a healthy varied diet most children will not experience nutritional deficiencies that lead to hair loss. however if you suspect a problem speak to your child's doctor before giving nutritional supplements. endocrine problems. in some children the cause of hair loss is hypothyroidism a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and is producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones required for regulating metabolism. a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by a blood test and possibly a scan of the thyroid gland."

    "Question": "can i get herpes from sharing a pipe? . so i just shared a pipe with a friend i suspect may have a cold sore on his lip. it was a visible scab he claimed it was from hot oil on his face but lets assume it is herpes. i would wipe off the tip of the glass pipe pretty good on my shirt and waited to hit it several seconds after passed to me. i am paranoid now. i just got home and brushed my teeth and used listerine. how likely is it i have herpes now?",
    "Answer": "herpes simplex virus can be spread in that manner if this person had herpes and you were susceptible to getting it. since many people have antibodies for herpes already from a past infection (even from a child) you may not be susceptible. if you are then keep in mind that not all exposed people will get it. if you were exposed only time will tell. herpes can take several weeks to a few months after exposure before you may see an herpetic break out. sadly brushing your teeth using listerine and wiping off that pipe beforehand did not lower your risk."

    "Question": "i have fibromyalgia with severe leg pain radiating from the hip area to my toes. can antidepressants help? . i was taking effexor for depression and that helped but i went off because of side effects.",
    "Answer": "leg pains are very common in fm including referred pain nerve pain restless leg syndrome and muscle spasm pain. other causes of leg pain can include disc problems pinched nerves peripheral neuropathy vascular disease joint disease etc. [could p]rior work injuries could be involved? please have your doctor look over any new or persistent pain problems. antidepressents are known to help fm pain in many people. there's been an accumulating body of medical evidence demonstrating how different antidepressant meds: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like effexor) and tricyclic antidepressants can help decrease fm pain. it's common for patients not to first realize how much a med may be helping until they go off of it. they may understate or underappreciate the med's pain-relieving benefit while on it but realize it must have been working because the pain level escalates once off the med. discuss with your doctor possible additional medicine strategies. i was on effexor for quite a while and found it very effective. however when i started to have problems with muscles and aches. not knowing that i was probably dealing with fibromyalgia. i switched to cymbalta. i have found it to be helpful with the aches. your pain sounds like you may be having problems with your sciatica. a nerve that runs from your lower back down through your butt. and then down the leg. it can be very painful. i have had spinal injections that have been helpful and for a brief time participated in a pain management program. sometimes it is hard to figure what comes first the chronic pain or the depression. i will say that effective pain management does allow me to focus more on dealing with the depression. talk with your doctor about developing a plan that can try to address both issues. best wishes to you."

    "Answer": "do not try to \"pop\" your ears. your perforated eardrum is trying to heal and any increased pressure from tying to pop them could interfere with the natural healing (which may take several weeks depending on the size of the perforation). the feeling you are experiencing may be more related to the inflammation of your eardrum than the need to pop your ears."

    "Answer": "many people have lower/normal body temperatures. you do not have to calculate a higher temperature concern based on this lower temperature. extremely high temperatures capable of causing problems will usually have a discoverable cause most likely a biological event. seasoned medical providers only use body temperature as just one of the evaluative guidelines but do not put a lot of emphasis on the measurement. people tend to fear fevers but fever is the body's normal response to fighting infection so in most cases it should not even be pharmacologically-lowered using drugs. it should be welcomed not feared."

    "Answer": "there is a problem and it would be helpful to know if you are male or female. but with that said you need to go to student health or your primary care medical provider for a urinalysis and perhaps a blood sugar test. in females urethritis or a urinary tract infection is high on the list. in males one needs to think about prostatitis. for both diabetes needs to be considered (especially if you are having a desire to drink all of the time as well). there are many other causes of course but the internet poses some significant barriers when it comes to making accurate blind diagnoses. you need to see a medical provider now. don't wait any more time."

    "Question": "can sleep deprivation cause aggressive behavior in children?",
    "Answer": "it’s becoming more widely known that sleep disordered breathing leads to poor behavior in children. estimates show that as many of 25% of children diagnosed with add or adhd may actually have an underlying sleep problem that can be treated – resulting in better behavior and improved learning skills. most often a sleep problem is identified in children and then health providers researchers and parents look for behavior issues. a new study at the university of michigan approached children behavior and their sleep with a new twist: the study first looked for children with certain behaviors and then looked at the sleep patterns of those children. the cross sectional survey at the university of michigan showed some very intriguing results: kids who show aggressive behavior in school are twice as likely to have symptoms of sleep disordered breathing as children that do not exhibit aggressive behaviors. of the 341 students surveyed by the researchers about 32% were assessed by their parent or teacher as having a conduct problem via a standardized behavior questionnaire. parents of these children also completed a standardized pediatric sleep questionnaire and scores for identification of symptoms for sleep disordered breathing (snoring stopping breathing daytime sleepiness etc. ) were collected. so aggressive kids appear to be sleepy kids and it is not always because they are snoring (which might make you think they are not getting good quality sleep). what could be the culprits? not getting kids to bed on time kids rooms not being conducive to sleep formal sleep disorders"

    "Question": "is smokeless tobacco a safer alternative for diabetics than smoking cigarettes?",
    "Answer": "smokeless tobacco is not a harmless form of tobacco and it is not a safe alternative to smoking cigarettes. the two main types of smokeless tobacco are chewing tobacco and snuff. smokeless tobacco can cause cancer and oral health problems. electronic cigarettes are devices that mimic tobacco smoke and are marketed as an alternative to smoking. using an electronic cigarette is better than smoking real cigarettes although not quite as good as completely quitting and dropping your smoking habit altogether. there is concern that electronic cigarettes are appealing to non-smokers like children. if you are interested in quitting smoking talk with your pharmacist as there are a number of options that can help you quit."

    "Answer": "this could be a sign of dehydration. one way to tell if a person is dehydrated is to pinch the skin on the back of the hand for a second then let go. the skin should snap back immediately. if the skin stays tented even for a few seconds this can be a sign of dehydration. you might try drinking more fluids particularly water to see if this helps your fingertip problem clear up. if it doesn't or if the tingling issue gets worse it would be worth making an appointment with your primary health care provider for further investigation. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what are good strength-training exercises for the glutes?",
    "Answer": "(please clear any kind of exercise program with your physician and fitness professional especially if you have any physical disability or restrictions. ) 1. squats: squats are your mainstay for building and strengthening your buns. stand with feet hip-width apart and hold weights at shoulder level or at your sides. bend the knees and lower into a squat keeping the knees behind the toes. imagine that you’re sticking your butt out behind you but keep the torso upright and contracted. press into the heels to stand up. repeat for 2-3 sets of 8-16 reps. 2. wall sit: stand about 2 feet in front of a wall and lean against it. slide down until your knees are at about 90-degree angles and hold keeping the abs contracted for 20-60 seconds. come back to start and repeat holding the squat at different angles to work the lower body in different ways. to add intensity hold weights or squeeze a ball between the knees. 3. leg press: here you’ll be pushing a weight or resistance away from yourself using your legs. this can be done with gym equipment or bands. 4. lunges: these exercises come in a variety of forms. the traditional lunge goes forward with weights and a bent knee or there is the assisted lunge with no weight and you can hold onto a wall or chair. or you can try a lunge that requires a much smaller range of motion lowering your body only part way. 5. dead lift: this exercise is not meant for everyone. it targets the lower back glutes and hamstrings. if you have any problems with these muscles don’t do a dead lift. this exercise simulates what we do all day long as we bend over and pick things up. 6. hip extension: this is one of my favorite exercises to strengthen the glutes. stand facing a wall placing both palms on the wall and with a straight back simply push one leg out behind you as high as you can go keeping the back and leg straight. do this 10 times switching legs each time. or you can get on the floor on all fours and take one leg and simply stretch it straight behind you. do this 10 times switching legs each time. if you use ankle weights you can add more intensity for a real glute challenge."

    "Answer": "hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "for girls just entering puberty it’s not unusual to have irregular periods. at the beginning of this stage of development not having regular and monthly periods is not uncommon. most likely her body is adjusting to what will be a very complex interplay of hormones that result in breast develop fat redistribution bone maturation and monthly periods. otherwise known as puberty this is a complete delicate and permanent change in her body. however other clues to look at are stress changes in weight and excess exercise. many girls participate in daily and strenuous physical activity and this can alter the delicate hormones that result in monthly cycles. often if exercise is excessive and accompanied by extreme weight loss this can cause missed periods. if you’ve notice an increase in facial hair acne or if she is overweight consider a prediabetes-like condition known as pcos. a family history is important. are there other women that have had late onset of periods irregular period or excess body hair? her missed periods could be a normal part of development. this is the perfect time for her and you to visit the pediatrician. your daughter is entering a completely new stage of her life and she will have many questions about her body and the changes that will happen physically and emotionally. this is an excellent question. it sound like you and your daughter have a close relationship and can talk about these things easily which is great. during the first couple of years after a girl starts menstruating her periods may be irregular. several things can cause a young woman to miss a period including being underweight overweight or under a lot of stress. of course a key question here and i don't mean to be indelicate is: is your daughter sexually active? it's not unheard of for girls as young as 13 to be involved with boys. obviously if your daughter is sexually active then a home pregnancy test is warranted. also has your daughter seen a gynecologist yet? since she has started menstruating and is having irregular periods it might be a good idea for her to have her first pelvic exam. a gynecologist can answer all of your (and her) questions about puberty and what to expect. best wishes to you both! elizabeth no my daughter is not sexually active. so we can rule that one out. any other suggestions?"

    "Question": "why do vicidon make me itch",
    "Answer": "this sounds like a side effect you should monitor closely. sometimes itching can progress into a more severe allergic reaction. some opioid pain relievers (like vicodin) can cause a release of histamine in the body. this histamine release causes itching. think about the way pollen causes your nose to itch. that itching is called a 'histamine reaction ' and you take an antihistamine to make the itching stop. the same thing can happen in some people when they take opioid pain relievers. you can take an antihistamine with the vicodin to see if that helps stop the itching. i'd recommend you speak to your care provider to see if you should stop the vicodin and take something else. of course if you experience swelling of the face tongue or throat along with the itching you should seek emergency medical attention. these can be symptoms of a life-threatening allergic reaction. itching is a not-uncommon side effect from opioid pain relievers in my experience. but keep an eye on your symptoms anyway. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "for people with allergic asthma allergy shots (immunotherapy) can be effective at reducing allergic triggers to asthma. an allergist would evaluate to determine if he/she thinks you would benefit from allergy shots. asthma should be controlled as best as possible with medications before starting allergy shots. . because you are being injected with things you are allergic to there is a risk of having an allergic reaction. most patients do not have any side effects and those that experience side effects typically have localized itching and swelling at the injection side. in very rare cases people experience severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. most cases of anaphylaxis happen shortly after the allergy shots are given that is why you are required to be monitored in the clinic for a period of time. the allergy office is prepared with the needed medications to treat patients with severe reactions. the risk of a fatal reaction is extremely small but there have been a few cases of patients having fatal reactions. because of this it will be important that you understand the protocol and instructions for the allergy shots. there are many safety procedures in place to prevent serious reactions. if you have any questions about the protocol or risk you should thoroughly discuss with your allergist before starting."

    "Answer": "someday manufacturers may have the flavonoid content on their packaging but we aren't quite there yet. basically cocoa powder has the highest amount of phytochemicals followed by bittersweet and then semisweet chocolate. the dark chocolate that has 60% cacao or more on the label is a good sign. you might find out about the specific process used by the chocolate company by checking their website. i personally find dark chocolate very satisfying!"

    "Question": "how does coronary artery disease develop?",
    "Answer": "coronary artery disease occurs when atherosclerotic plaque (hardening of the arteries) builds up in the wall of the arteries that supply the heart. this plaque is primarily made of cholesterol. plaque accumulation can be accelerated by smoking high blood pressure elevated cholesterol and diabetes. patients are also at higher risk for plaque development if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a family history of early heart artery disease. the atherosclerotic process causes significant narrowing in one or more coronary arteries. when coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70% the blood supply beyond the plaque is not enough to meet the increased oxygen demand during exercise. the heart muscle in the area of these arteries becomes starved of oxygen (ischemic). patients often experience chest pain (angina) when the blood oxygen supply cannot keep up with demand. up to 25% of patients experience no chest pain at all despite a lack of adequate blood and oxygen supply. these patients have \"silent\" angina and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. when a blood clot (thrombus) forms on top of this plaque the artery becomes completely blocked causing a heart attack. when arteries are narrowed 90% to 99% patients often have accelerated angina or angina at rest (unstable angina). unstable angina can also occur due to the blockage of an artery by a clot that eventually is dissolved by the body's own protective clot-dissolving system."

    "Answer": "masturbation is considered harmless and it does not make you weak. you should not feel guilty about this normal practice nor stuggle to try and stop. while excessive masturbation could be a sign of compulsion or an underlying stress what you are doing now is absolutely normal. seeing a medical provider to determine why you are so weak would be advised. your weakness is not caused by masturbation."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer you need to see a medical professional for a thorough examination. there are many different types of headaches. while migraines tend to be one-sided getting a proper diagnosis with the type of headache you have is very important when it comes to determining an effective treatment. because you are having visual issues your medical provider or neurologist may also want you to see a eye specialist."

    "Answer": "it's impossible to say what's going on without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider or your gynecologist. breast cancer can cause nipple soreness so it's not something you want to ignore (even if you're a man). another common cause of nipple soreness is called \"runner's nipple. \" this occurs when the nipple becomes irritated due to clothing rubbing across it repeatedly. this chafing can cause the nipple to become red inflamed and very tender. you don't have to be a runner to have this happen; any constrictive clothing can cause it from tight bras to t-shirts. you can treat runner's nipple by gently cleansing the nipple applying lotion and then putting an adhesive bandage over it to protect it from chafing. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "well this certainly deserves a trip to the doctor's office. you can start with your primary care provider (pcp). it may turn out to be nothing but unexpected violent episodes of vomiting shouldn't be ignored when they happen multiple times. many things could cause this including a food intolerance or allergy. it would be best to get the pcp's opinion as to what might be causing this. meanwhile it would help if your son kept a log of what he ate just before vomiting. also it would be useful to know if his bowel movements are regular of if he's frequently constipated. (not that he's going to want to discuss these topics! ) constipation can cause vomiting in some cases. i wish you and your son all the best with this!"

    "Question": "can schizophrenia be inherited?",
    "Answer": "scientists have long known that schizophrenia runs in families. it occurs in 1 percent of the general population but is seen in 10 percent of people with a first-degree relative (a parent brother or sister) with the disorder. people who have second-degree relatives (aunts uncles grandparents or cousins) with the disease also develop schizophrenia more often than the general population. the identical twin of a person with schizophrenia is most at risk with a 40 to 65 percent chance of developing the disorder. our genes are located on 23 pairs of chromosomes that are found in each cell. we inherit two copies of each gene one from each parent. several of these genes are thought to be associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia but scientists believe that each gene has a very small effect and is not responsible for causing the disease by itself. it is still not possible to predict who will develop the disease by looking at genetic material. although there is a genetic risk for schizophrenia it is not likely that genes alone are sufficient to cause the disorder. interactions between genes and the environment are thought to be necessary for schizophrenia to develop. many environmental factors have been suggested as risk factors such as exposure to viruses or malnutrition in the womb problems during birth and psychosocial factors like stressful environmental conditions."

    "Answer": "if you are exposed to carbon monoxide or if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected your doctor will ask questions about your medical history. questions may include how long symptoms have been present what the source of possible exposure to carbon monoxide is how many other people (family members or coworkers) have the same symptoms and what home heating and cooking appliances have been used. with this information your doctor may decide that a test for carbon monoxide is necessary. the standard test for carbon monoxide measures the amount of hemoglobin that has bonded with carbon monoxide. this amount is also called the carboxyhemoglobin (cohb) level. testing should never delay treatment. treatment should be started as soon as possible. other tests such as an arterial blood gas (abg) and a complete blood count (cbc) also may be done if you have or are suspected of having carbon monoxide poisoning. these tests may be done to evaluate your overall health or to identify problems caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. a handheld breath analyzer measures how much carbon monoxide is in the air you exhale. this test measures high levels of the gas but may not be reliable in detecting low levels. other tests questionnaires and other tests may be used to detect subtle changes in your ability to think clearly if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected. they also may be used to determine what other treatment is needed. if you do have carbon monoxide poisoning you will probably have tests to check for heart damage such as ecg and cardiac enzyme studies. early detection there is no routine screening for carbon monoxide poisoning. if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected further tests will be done. in the winter months carbon monoxide poisoning may be suspected in people who go to the emergency room with symptoms of a severe headache nausea or dizziness. information about a person's home workplace and any illness of family members and coworkers is often gathered to determine whether a test for carbon monoxide should be done. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "weight is a really important factor to the postmenopausal woman. higher body mass index and postmenopausal weight gain increase a woman’s risk for breast cancer. a woman who has a bmi of more than 33 is 27% more likely to get breast cancer than a woman with a bmi of less than 21. losing about 22 pounds will lower your risk regular physical activity can help women protect themselves from breast cancer. engaging in say fast walking for 10 hours or more per week can benefit women immensely. drinking alcohol has definitely been shown to be a risk factor and the more one drinks the higher the risk. i always say “one drink is good for the heart but two drinks are bad for your breasts”. other factors that seem to help decrease the risk: eating olive oil sticking to a low-fat diet that includes monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats complex carbohydrates and minimal red meat. taking vitamin d and coq10 may also help lower your risk. soy is still controversial so i advise eating no more than what is in a standard asian diet — 20 grams per day. breastfeeding for a least six months may decrease breast cancer risk. with every 12 months of breastfeeding a reduction of 4. 3% was seen for breast cancer risk. finally if a woman can control for this she should try to have a baby at a younger age. having a first baby before age 25 will decrease a woman’s risk by 10% and having a baby before 35 decreases her risk by 5%. unfortunately having a first baby later in life puts a woman at greater risk for breast cancer because of perimenopausal breast changes from hormones of pregnancy. yes"

    "Question": "when do you use dextromethorphan vs guaifenesin",
    "Answer": "dextromethorophan is a cough suppressant; guaifenesin is a mucous-thinning medication that can actually increase a cough. if you goal is to stop/control a cough especially at night then dextromethorophan (assuming it is not included in a combination product containing a decongestant) is what you would use. if you goal is to thin a cough so that a person can spit it up then guaifenesin (during the day) would be helpful if the person is capable of coughing up phlegm. children often cannot do this. guaifenesin at bedtime will most likely increase the cough because of post-nasal drainage."

    "Question": "what should i do if i think i’ve had an insulin overdose?",
    "Answer": "the first thing is to not panic if you have an insulin overdose. in most cases an insulin overdose can be treated at home. follow these steps as long as you're conscious and able to do so: check your sugar. drink one-half cup of regular soda or sweetened fruit juice and eat a hard candy or glucose paste or tablets. if you skipped a meal eat something now. fifteen to twenty grams of carbohydrates should raise your blood glucose level. rest. get off your feet and take a break. recheck your blood sugar after 15 or 20 minutes. observe. pay attention to how you feel for the next few hours. if you still have symptoms check your sugar again an hour after eating. keep snacking if sugar is low. if your sugar level stays low after two hours or if your symptoms aren't improving seek medical help. don't worry about pushing your sugar too high if it's only for a short time. one high level won't hurt you but a very low sugar can. if you're unconscious or too confused or are having seizures your loved ones will have to take control. they should know how to do the following: if you lose consciousness they should call 911 immediately. they should inject you with glucagon an insulin antidote. if you are prone to low blood sugar ask your doctor if you should have glucagon on hand at home. if you're alert enough to follow instructions they should give you sweet juice to drink. if your symptoms don't steadily improve over the next hour they should call 911."

    "Question": "what can be done to avoid the consequences of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the \"hyper\" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children."

    "Answer": "hi this is from matthew hoffman md here on webmd. hope its the answer your looking for. it’s uncommon (though not unheard of) for shingles to affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva. it’s very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur. shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood. most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox. after we recover from chickenpox varicella doesn’t disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years. later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles. (varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from hsv-1 and hsv-2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals. ) varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina. ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to hsv-1 or hsv-2 (herpes infections). taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though. do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "my short answer to your question is this: any time you've got a lump on the head and you're worried about it it's ok to go see the doctor. a major point i want to make is this: never ever take a blood-thinning pain reliever such as advil (ibuprofen also goes by the name motrin) aspirin (brand names excedrin bufferin anacin etc. ) or naproxyn (brand names alleve naprosyn) after hitting your head. these medications can cause bleeding which could turn a not-so-serious injury into a very serious injury. i'm glad your husband seems to be doing fine and it's always better for the swelling to be on the outside of the skull than the inside. however if your husband has dilated pupils (the black dots at the center of his eyeball) slurred speech or loss of balance you should take him to the doctor right away. these can be signs of a more serious head injury. with a bruise the size you're describing it's likely your husband has suffered a concussion. these may range from mild to severe. again if you have any concerns about the extent of his head injury your safest bet is always to seek medical attention. since it's been more than 24 hours since the accident you don't need to rush to the emergency room. but you definitely can get evaluated at an urgent care facility or ask your primary care provider to work your husband in for an appointment soon. best wishes to you!"

    "Answer": "types of prostatitis include: acute bacterial prostatitis. a sudden bacterial infection marked by inflammation of the prostate. this is the least common form of prostatitis but the symptoms are usually severe. patients with this condition have an acute urinary tract infection with increased urinary frequency and urgency need to urinate a lot at night and have pain in the pelvis and genital area. they often have fever chills nausea vomiting and burning when urinating. acute bacterial prostatitis requires prompt treatment as the condition can lead to bladder infections abscesses in the prostate or in extreme cases completely blocked urine flow. left untreated the condition can cause confusion and low blood pressure and may be fatal. the condition is usually treated in the hospital with intravenous antibiotics pain relievers and fluids. chronic bacterial prostatitis. this condition is the result of recurrent urinary tract infections that have entered the prostate gland. it is thought to exist for several years in some men before producing symptoms. the symptoms are similar to acute bacterial prostatitis but are less severe and can fluctuate in intensity. the diagnosis of this condition is often challenging. it's often difficult to find the bacteria in the urine. treatment includes antibiotics for four to 12 weeks and other treatment for pain. sometimes men are given suppressive low-dose long-duration antibiotic therapy. chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. this is the most common form of the disease accounting for 90% of the cases. the condition is marked by urinary and genital pain for at least three of the past six months. patients have no bacteria in their urine but may have other signs of inflammation. the condition can be confused with interstitial cystitis (a chronic inflammation of the bladder)."

    "Answer": "good for you for performing a testicular self-exam. it's critically important to the early detection of cancer. that said i don't want you to immediately assume you have testicular cancer. you do need to get those lumps checked out by a doctor though. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible. other conditions such as benign (non-cancerous) cysts can cause lumps in the scrotum. your health care provider will be able to diagnose what those lumps are and get you appropriate treatment. wishing you all the best!"

    "Question": "does hernia caouse infertility? . hey there! i have hernia. there is pain in my scrotum. does it cause to infertility.?",
    "Answer": "hi this is from the uk's nhs as you said that you have a hernia. an inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel such as the intestine pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. the hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin or as an enlarged scrotum. the lump is often painless but it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation). so hence the pain and this would lead on to infertility. if its that bad and you want a child then its time to get it worked on. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "while most flu activity occurs from october to may in the united states flu viruses are detected year-round including at lower levels during the summer months. if you have flu-like symptoms and it is not flu season it is possible that you and your daughter have a flu-like illness. this means that you have a viral illness that causes symptoms similar to those of the flu but it may not be caused by influenza. flu-like illnesses can make you feel bad but they are less likely to cause severe symptoms and complications than influenza. if you suspect that you or your daughter may have the flu contact your health care provider. you may need to get tested so your doctor can determine if your symptoms are caused by influenza or something else. if it is influenza antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness. antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you and your daughter are sick."

    "Answer": "hi just been doing a little bit more research and found this small piece of info see when you start doing research as you know you have to fight your way through lots of rubbish but this come out of the rubbish you may like to copy it and show your doctor of all things its from the uk's daily mail its a daily news paper see what you think. breast size is essentially determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. while genes are beyond our control lifestyle modifications may be effective in reducing bust size. the main hormone that determines breast size is oestrogen. the more oestrogen you have in your system the bigger your breasts will tend to be. this is why women often find that their breasts enlarge when they take oestrogen-based medication such as the 'combined' pill (a mix of oestrogen and progesterone) or hrt. as far reducing your bust size is concerned i would therefore advise you to avoid using the combined pill. in addition it is important for you to be aware that traces of oestrogen from the pill are excreted in the urine and may make it into the water supply. oestrogen-like compounds (also known as 'xeno-oestrogens') from plastic packaging (including plastic bottles) and industrial residues are also known to contaminate food and drinks. for these reasons i would advise you to drink mineral water from glass bottles whenever possible and avoid processed foods packaged in plastic. meat and possibly some dairy products tend to contain oestrogen and should also be moderated in the diet. oestrogen is broken down in the liver so anything you do to improve liver function might help. eating a diet based on wholefoods fruits and vegetables (preferably organic) with plenty of water and very little caffeine and alcohol should help to maximise your liver function and minimise the impact of oestrogen in your body. you might also try a supplement of the herb agnus castus. one of this herb's chief effects is to increase the level of the hormone progesterone which tends to help moderate and balance the effects of oestrogen in the body. the normal recommended dose of agnus castus is 40 mg of dried herb or 40 drops of concentrated liquid extract once a day or 20 mg of dried herb twice a day. agnus castus preparations are readily available in health food stores. its the part on the liver that could point the way to your problem perhaps something is going wrong there when it comes to your hormones. good luck"

    "Question": "what causes hepatitis c?",
    "Answer": "hepatitis c is a liver disease that is caused by infection with the hepatitis c virus a virus that lives in your liver cells. how it spreads you cannot get hepatitis c from casual contact such as hugging kissing sneezing coughing or sharing food or water with someone. you can get hepatitis c if you come into contact with the blood of someone who has hepatitis c. the most common way to get hepatitis c is by sharing needles and other equipment (such as cotton spoons and water) used to inject illegal drugs. if you are injecting drugs the best way to protect yourself is by not sharing needles or other equipment with others. many cities have needle exchange programs that provide free sterile needles so that you do not have to share needles. if you want to stop using drugs ask your doctor or someone you trust to help you get into a drug treatment program. before 1992 people could get hepatitis c through blood transfusions and organ transplants. since 1992 all donated blood and organs are screened for hepatitis c so it is now rare to get the virus this way. in rare cases a mother with hepatitis c spreads the virus to her baby at birth or a health care worker is accidentally exposed to blood that is infected with hepatitis c. experts are not sure whether you can get hepatitis c through sexual contact. if there is a risk of getting the virus through sexual contact it is very small. your risk is especially low if you are in a long-term monogamous relationship. if you live with someone who has hepatitis c or you know someone with hepatitis c you generally do not need to worry about getting the disease. you can help protect yourself by not sharing anything that may have blood on it such as razors toothbrushes and nail clippers. contagious and incubation periods the incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after the hepatitis c virus has entered your body and it is any time from 2 weeks to 6 months. anyone who has hepatitis c can spread the virus to someone else. if testing shows you have hepatitis c do not share needles. and keep cuts scrapes and blisters covered. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer i have never heard that cholesterol causes stomach pains. just because a cause was not readily apparent does not mean one should blame this type of pain on cholesterol. the fact that he is still in pain (after eating) and going through pepto bismol is proof that he needs to have a higher level evaluation. seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist would be the way to go if his pediatrician or primary care provider is not willing to order further diagnostic tests. there are so many things that could be causing this discomfort for gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) reflux gallbladder disease (especially if your son is overweight) hiatal hernia etc. appendicitis would likely cause pain in his right lower quadrant (down near the right iliac/hip area) and would not really present symptoms like you are describing. if he is under stress at home or school this could be making things worse. get a referral to a gastroenterologist so that he can be properly diagnosed and treated. stomach pains in an 8 year old could be many things- gastritis (when the stomach lining is irritated) reflux (like heartburn in adults) constipation or something more serious. sometimes anxiety or stress can make kids have abdominal pain. in any case you should be seen by your doctor or a specialist. if its been going on for a while your son needs to be evaluated. i have not heard of cholesterol issues causing stomach pains. talk to your doctor or subspecialist as soon as you can."

    "Question": "after working out i sometimes get a pain in my backside. it seems similar to sciatica. how can i ease this pain?",
    "Answer": "it is important to differentiate between sore muscles from the workout and a possible injury. you typically feel sore muscles about a day later and the feeling can last for 2 to 3 days. you can treat it with rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin ibuprofen or naproxen. if there is pain associated with the sciatica you should consult your physician to make sure there isn't a more intense injury that needs to be treated."

    "Question": "lumbar puncture complications. i had a lumbar puncture done in my local er 4 days ago to rule out meningitis. i have had severe neck pain (at the time) for 8 days with a headache. bp was 157/110. when the med student (at the hands of the er physician) took 6 tries to get it in the right place she then hit a tendon. the er dr. asked her if she heard that \"pop\" and explained to her she hit a tendon. could this be why i am still very sore at the sight? shouldnt they have explained this to me?",
    "Answer": "thank goodness you apparently don't have meningitis! how scary. in answer to your last question: yes i think the er doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture. in fact you should have received some sort of written instructions. beyond that i think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts. it's possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon. however if you begin to run a fever it's time to seek medical attention. fever could be a sign of infection. lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur after-the-fact. i don't think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if you're concerned you might give your primary care provider a call. it never hurts (no pun intended) to get these things checked out. i hope you feel better soon! also you should know that after a spinal tap you are supposed to rest at least 24 hours after having the procedure. i've had viral meningitis before so when i have similar symptoms the er doctor will give me a spinal tap. thankfully those have come up negative. unfortunately the first spinal tap i had after have the viral meningitis no one told me i was supposed to rest for 24 hours and i went to church 6 hours later. i was back in the er 2 hours after church (wanted to stay to teach sunday school before going back to the hospital). make sure to always ask questions!"

    "Answer": "vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue. an accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesn't directly point to either condition. an endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex. your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause. however other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn. i would talk to my gynecologist if it's that much blood. at first i was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if it's a showstopper then that's another story. then did some looking around and fibroids or polyps could be the culprit and they don't affect a pap smear. i had a polyp once and went through a d&c and never had issues again. with fibroids i hear they can come back. i also read that some of this might be hormonal and since you have had a hysterectomy this might make sense. bottom line i'd go see your gyno. hope this helps."

    "Question": "can you really become addicted to those spray mist inhalants for a stuffy nose? is there any danger in using them?",
    "Answer": "nasal spray decongestants should not be used for more than three days. this is because they work by shrinking the mucous membranes in the nose in order to open the airways. when it wears off the mucous membranes swell up again making it hard to breathe without using the spray again. over time this can cause someone to rely on the sprays in order to breathe properly through their nose. nasal spray decongestants are safe to use if used as directed and are quite effective at relieving congestion without systemic side effects but it is important to limit their use to no more than three days."

    "Answer": "aw poor baby! and poor mom having to go through this. i would not recommend self-treating this. i would do as the doctor said and wait to see how your son is doing in 5 days. your doctor has very good reasons for recommending your son's foot not be casted (immobilized) for a period of time. it's possible that immobilizing the limb by using something like a walking boot could cause muscle atrophy (shrinkage) which would be damaging to your son. if you have any questions about why your doctor recommended taking a wait-and-see approach then i'd suggest you call and ask him. in the moment of crisis when you're in the er and feeling anxious about your baby's health it's easy to forget to ask questions. your doctor won't mind if you call and find out exactly why he's taking this approach with your son. best wishes to you and the little one! i have a aircast on right night. what you might like about it is that it is designed to take away the moisture or air everytime he put's preasure on it. also the hard plastic sides actually feels good around because of the air flow but yet secure. that's hard to believe but it is true for me. i am still not walking. i probably tore something. but regardless this aircast did protect me and with only 2 straps it is easier for you to remove and put back on. also is designed to wear in a shoe. i could not tackle that but as a mother of a young boy i believe this is the better choice. that 5 day cast would make the transition harder for your child because it is so much heavier. if your concerns is based on protection. the aircast can do the job in my opinion."

    "Question": "is there a downside to oral erection drugs?",
    "Answer": "well the downside to these products is that there are side effects. for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications. if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication. this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems. because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure. the combination can be deadly. there can be some visual disorders. one of the big side effects is that the drug really isn’t being used correctly for many men. they’re either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before it’s effective they try it once and they say it’s not going to work and they’ll go try something else. the other thing is it’s become very recreational. a lot of guys who don’t need it are taking it which raises some concerns. why? because it’s almost become the thing to do. you know you take the drug and you’re guaranteed a good erection. well if you had good erections before it probably won’t help but it’s just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun. the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction that’s a symptom of something far more serious whether it’s diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders. that’s an early warning sign. and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause i’m really doing them a lot of disservice. if it’s truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if it’s the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you don’t do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented. it’s essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction. some men just get it and that’s the way that you are. but you want to make sure that there’s nothing serious that you’re missing."

    "Question": "can you get aids/hiv from kissing?",
    "Answer": "you cannot get hiv from kissing not even french kissing. the common explanation we give is that hiv has to be in large amounts to get into the bloodstream to cause infection. in saliva you would have to drink or come in contact with a bucket of saliva with hiv in order to get enough of the virus to get an infection. also the inside lining of the mouth is tough to deal with chewing so unless there is a bleeding gum or ulcer on the mouth and someone with hiv gets either a bucket of saliva in your mouth or bleeds in your mouth (which hopefully will not be happening) the risk is extremely low."

    "Question": "what is an heart murmur and can it be treated?",
    "Answer": "a heart murmur is a sign on physical exam but not a diagnosis unto itself. blood passes through the heart's four valves during every cardiac cycle. some people have valves that are leaky or don't open quite as well as they should. others have valves with either genetic abnormalities or changes that occur throughout life. and still others have totally normal valves. all of the above can create a \"murmur \" which is basically just the sound of blood flowing through. there are other less common causes of murmurs too that don't involve valves. sometimes we can make the diagnosis by just listening and other times we recommend an ultrasound of the heart to visualize the valves and determine if there are any abnormalities. it's not uncommon to hear a murmur get an ultrasound (also called an echocardiogram) and find that everything looks totally normal and does not require treatment or even follow-up. your son should talk to his doctor about whether an ultrasound would be appropriate. if he has any symptoms (chest pain shortness of breath fatigue) then it may be more appropriate to get an echocardiogram."

    "Answer": "smokers can be charged more for their coverage under the law than non-smokers by as much as 50%. the law defines a tobacco user as someone who uses any tobacco product including cigarettes cigars chewing tobacco snuff and pipe tobacco four or more times a week within the past 6 months. under small employer health plans you can't be charged the surcharge if you join a smoking cessation program but that's not available to people buying coverage on their own. some states have decided that insurers cannot charge smokers more for coverage so see what's available in your state."

    "Answer": "trainers have developed thousands of plyometric exercises. a simple routine for children and adolescents can start with one to three sets of six to 10 repetitions of one upper-body exercise such as a medicine ball chest pass and one lower body exercise such as a double-leg hop on two nonconsecutive days per week. as muscle strength increases the routine can be expanded to include multiple medicine ball throws jumps and single leg-hops. plyometrics routines for qualified adults range from low-intensity double-leg hops to high-intensity drills such as depth jumps which involve jumping up to and down from boxes or benches as high as 42 inches. high-intensity drills can subject a participant to forces up to seven times his or her body weight. for sports that require explosive lower-body power a plyometric routine may start with ground-level jumping on soft surfaces such as padded mats or grass progress to jumping over cones or foam barriers and then advance to bounding exercises performed in straight lines and patterns."

    "Answer": "hyperthyroidism can be suspected in patients with tremors; excessive sweating; smooth velvety skin; fine hair; a rapid heart rate; and an enlarged thyroid gland. there may be puffiness around the eyes and a characteristic stare due to the elevation of the upper eyelids. advanced symptoms are easily detected but early symptoms especially in the elderly may be quite inconspicuous. in all cases a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually elevated with this disease. however the main tool for detection of hyperthyroidism is measurement of the blood thyroid stimulating hormone level. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if an excess amount of thyroid hormone is present tsh is \"down-regulated\" and the level of tsh falls in an attempt to control thyroid hormone production. thus the measurement of tsh should result in low or undetectable levels in cases of hyperthyroidism. however there is one exception. if the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is actually due to a tsh-secreting pituitary tumor then the levels are abnormally high. this uncommon disease is known as \"secondary hyperthyroidism. \""

    "Answer": "prozac an anti-depressant is an ssri (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor). while there are a number of reasons why an individual might take an anti-depressant – the reason cited 90 percent of the time is depression. sadly research has shown that depression has been linked more often than not as a side effect to other medications substance abuse and/or other types of medical conditions – than as a condition on its own. anti-depressants such as abilify zoloft cymbalta and prozac are used to treat depression but unless the reason or cause of the depression is defined and addressed the individual could end up taking the drug indefinitely or worse self-medicating to treat the symptoms. xanax on the other hand is a sedative/tranquilizer and part of the benzodiazepine drug class. although studies have shown that chronic abuse of sedatives and tranquilizers result in the drug’s ineffectiveness many users develop addictive tendencies and without professional assistance cannot stop. long-term use of either/both of these drugs can have lasting effects that can make it very difficult to stop without professional medical detox treatment. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Answer": "with proper therapy the children with arthritis will usually improve over time. indeed the vast majority of children with arthritis grow up to lead normal lives without significant difficulty. even for severe cases with proper medications proper physical and occupational therapy and proper surgery if necessary virtually no one with arthritis should need a wheelchair. everyone's doctor knows stories of children who looked awful but did very well or looked like it was \"nothing serious \" who became very sick. but these are the rare exceptions. there are many recent significant improvements in treating children with arthritis. for over 95% of the children with arthritis today we don't need new drugs or miraculous inventions. we just need proper application of the resources we already have. there are three important things for every child or adolescent with arthritis. first is proper recognition and diagnosis of the disease. second is proper treatment by an experienced physician with multidisciplinary support including physical and occupational therapists and orthopedic surgeons. third is proper education of the patient and family. people with arthritis are no different than everyone else in the world. they all need to grow up have jobs get married and have families. some will have some difficulty with mechanical problems. many will have small things they can't do if you watch them carefully. few will go on to be professional athletes or military officers but even fewer will be \"totally disabled\" by their disease. there are far more children who are disabled because they are told they couldn't do things than children who are really disabled by their disease. we should never accept a child with arthritis being told to use a wheelchair. in almost every case it is hoped that we will be able to correct the problem and get them walking again. this is why educating the public and physicians is so important. it must be appreciated that children can develop arthritis and must be properly diagnosed and treated. each child should be able to reach his or her full potential. children with arthritis should be treated just like everyone else. they need the same discipline the same allowance the same grades and the same respect as all the other children. arthritis might affect the body but it must never be allowed to affect the mind."

    "Question": "pill identification without an imprint. this pill is white round and has a black l on it",
    "Answer": "unfortunately it's nearly impossible to say what drug the pill in question contains. with literally thousands of medications on the market both over-the-counter and prescription it's hard to identify a pill based on the markings. that said if you like a challenge you might take the pill to a pharmacist. perhaps he or she would recognize it as something very common. meanwhile never take a medication you can't identify. this could be very dangerous. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "how do you help someone understand depression when they don't belive depression exists? . i have suffered from depression on and off through the years (diagnosed with clinical depression at age 12). i have been having a difficult time lately and have recently started taking an antidepressant. my husband doesn't believe or understand anything about depression. he thinks you should be able to just \"shake it off\" and move on. how do i get him to understand that depression is real and i need his support to get better?",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this. i mean both the depressive episode and the lack of support from your husband. it's surprising how many people do not believe depression (or any other mental health issue) is a valid diagnosis. but believe me i've encountered many such people. it's possible your husband dismisses depression as a diagnosis because he's never (or rarely) dealt with it himself. for unknown reasons depression strikes women much more frequently than men. a couple of thoughts come to mind. first is to take your husband with you to your doctor so he or she can explain depression to your husband. or take your husband to see your psychotherapist for an explanation. maybe this will help sway him to understanding. meanwhile i invite you to connect with others in webmd's depression community and support group. these folks are dealing with many of the same issues you are and they may have suggestions for you. at the very least you may feel comforted being able to discuss these issues in a safe environment. i wish you all the best!"

    "Question": "how much exercise does it take to lower cholesterol?",
    "Answer": "exactly how much exercise is needed to lower cholesterol has been a matter of some debate. in general most public health organizations recommend at a minimum 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise such as walking jogging biking or gardening. but a 2002 study by researchers at duke university medical center found that more intense exercise is actually better than moderate exercise for lowering cholesterol. people who exercised vigorously also raised their levels of hdl -- the \"good\" kind of lipoprotein that helps clear cholesterol from the blood. \"we found it requires a good amount of high intensity exercise to significantly change hdl \" says william kraus md an assistant professor of medicine at duke and lead author on the study. even though moderate exercise was not as effective in reducing ldl -- the \"bad\" cholesterol -- or increasing hdl it did keep cholesterol levels from rising."

    "Answer": "head lice can affect people of any income or social level. it is very difficult to prevent lice from spreading among children because they commonly share hats combs and other items. frequently examining the scalps of your school-age children may help you discover and treat lice before they spread to the rest of your family. avoiding prolonged close contact with a person who has lice will also reduce your risk. pubic lice are spread primarily among people who have many sex partners. reducing the number of sex partners you have may help reduce your risk of getting pubic lice. body lice may be prevented by bathing regularly and changing clothes daily. body lice live on clothing not on the body. washing clothing in hot water [ or higher] will usually kill adult lice and prevent eggs from hatching. body lice that are on the skin usually go away on their own with daily bathing and wearing clothes that are not contaminated. medicines to kill body lice are usually not necessary. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

'. . can i eat peanuts? . can i eat potatoes? . if i eat veggies? how much each day or do i alternate= with a salad. . i eat a handful since i do not know if a cup a day- is just vegetable or includes green salad- a cupful?",
    "Answer": "the good news is that most people do not have to drastically change their diet when they start on the blood-thinner warfarin (coumadin). but you do have to pay close attention to what you are eating. the goal is to keep the level of vitamin k about the same from day to day. you can do this by knowing which foods have a lot of vitamin k and not making any big changes in how much of them you are eating each day. foods that have a lot of vitamin k include most of the green leafy vegetables like spinach kale lettuce cabbage swiss chard endive and seaweed. greens such as turnip collard and mustard are all high in vitamin k as well. other vegetables that contain a lot of vitamin k are cauliflower broccoli and asparagus. liver is also high in vitamin k. other things to watch out for include green tea canola oil and soybean oil. peanuts and potatoes do not have a large amount of vitamin k. but watch out for cashews and pine nuts. they have a bit more vitamin k so eat them sparingly. so what does all this mean? if you have always had a salad for lunch then it is probably fine to keep eating one every day as long as it is ok with your doctor. if you want broccoli or asparagus with your dinner for a change then it would be best to skip the salad that day. and remember to keep your portions small. liver has a lot of cholesterol so i would recommend skipping that altogether. if your doctor has recommended a multivitamin make sure you take it every day. they usually have vitamin k in them as well so you want to be consistent. talk to your doctor before making any changes in your diet. do not take any over-the-counter medicines or supplements without checking with your doctor first. some of them may interfere with your medicine. also be sure to get all blood tests done on time. don’t be overwhelmed! it may seem like a lot to do at first but it will become second nature before you know it."

    "Question": "i am pregnant and going to interview for a new job. will the new health insurance cover the pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "it depends. plans sold to small businesses must provide maternity benefits. large firms are not required to do so by law though it's very rare to find a large firm that offers health insurance that doesn't also cover maternity care. if you're eligible for insurance as part of your job you should be covered for maternity care though you can be required to wait for a period of up to 90 days to gain access to insurance."

    "Question": "how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.",
    "Answer": "hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically \"osteoarthritis\" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the \"wear and tear\" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define \"arthritis\" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps!"

    "Answer": "when it comes to hormonal contraceptives your best bet is to complete your current cycle and then attempt to get pregnant says frank a. chervenak md professor and chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at weill medical college of cornell university in new york city. \"after the cycle attempts can be made to start getting pregnant although it may be advisable to wait for the first normal menstrual period after you stop taking your pills \" he says. but this precaution is not essential. some women conceive within a week or two after stopping birth control pills. \"i advise women to complete the cycle so they don't have irregular bleeding \" he says. in general the middle of the month is when ovulation and potentially conception are most likely to take place so the optimal fertile window is a couple of weeks after stopping contraception. an important point to consider however is that \"if there has been a previous pregnancy or miscarriage wait about three months to give the body a chance to recover \" he says. \"this is where a waiting period makes sense. \" as far as other types of contraception the intrauterine device (iud) must be removed before a woman starts attempting to conceive he says. couples can just stop using condoms when they are ready to conceive he adds."

    "Question": "how do i sort through all the different health insurance plans to find the one best for me?",
    "Answer": "figuring out which insurance plan will best meet your health needs for the coming year is far from simple. if you get your insurance through an employer you’ll likely be given a few plan options from which to choose. if you buy insurance in the private market you can search for plans available in your area and compare the benefits side-by-side at either healthcare. gov or ehealthinsurance. com. when evaluating each plan take the following factors into consideration: do the math: estimating what your out-of-pocket costs will be over the course of the next year is one of the most important considerations when choosing a health plan. that means calculating the cost of items such as expected deductibles co-pays co-insurance and prescriptions. once you’ve added the numbers ask yourself: is it cheaper to purchase a high deductible plan with a lower monthly premium that costs me more before benefits kick in? or do i see a doctor frequently enough to make it worth my while to pay more each month for a plan that covers costs right away for each doctor visit or treatment? also factor in your worst-case scenario. what will your maximum financial exposure be if you get sick and need serious medical care? most insurers offer plan-modeling tools on their web site to help you factor in how many times you typically see a doctor during the year how many prescriptions you take and whether you’re planning a surgery to help you figure out what your total out-of-pocket costs might be and which plan options might best serve you. review covered services: if you’re planning to become pregnant and your plan doesn’t cover maternity care (a common situation in the private market) you’ll be left with a hefty bill upon baby’s arrival. carefully check out the list of excluded benefits in the health-plan summary. if in doubt call the insurance company directly to confirm that the type of care and services you require are covered under the plan you’re considering. provider networks and drug formularies: is your doctor in the network? are the three medications you take each month listed in the health plan’s formulary? if not you’re in for sticker shock. provider network and drug formulary information should be listed in the summary plan description or you can check the insurer’s web site for that information. if you’re searching for insurance on your own ehealthinsurance. com offers an option whereby you can type in your doctor’s name to see if she or he is in a health plan’s network. you might also want to call your doctor(s) directly to confirm participation."

    "Answer": "i understand how frustrating it can be to try different diets only to not lose weight or gain it all back. it's important to remember you are not alone and most people have difficulty losing weight and keeping it off. in fact a major review found that two thirds of people who diet not only gain their weight back but gain even more weight than when they started the diet. i'm not sure what your health is like or how much you need to lose but you might want to consider a different approach. one that doesn't focus so much on weight (here's why). the problem with diets is that they don't get at the root cause of someone's eating. you might want to consider working with a registered dietitian who focuses on eating issues and a more intuitive/mindful eating approach. the key is to develop a healthy lifestyle you enjoy that helps you lose gradual weight instead of an unrealistic diet that is hard to maintain. you can find a dietitian near you by going to eatright. org. if you are worried about a medical condition by all means get a physical and check your thyroid and discuss your health status with a healthcare provider. good luck!"

    "Question": "what happens to the lung in emphysema?",
    "Answer": "in emphysema the walls of the air sacs (alveolar septae) are destroyed. consequently the individual air spaces (alveoli) become larger but irregular and decreased in number. these larger spaces are less efficient than normal sized alveoli for gas exchange. thus emphysema impairs diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange). the more extensive the emphysema the poorer the gas exchange becomes. also in emphysema the capillaries are destroyed with the rest of the alveolar wall. as a result emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply emphysema usually starts in the upper lobes of the lung and is more severe in the upper lobes for complex reasons. that is the abnormal (enlarged and irregular) air sacs (alveoli) are more prominent in the upper lobes. (the blood vessels in the lungs should not be mistaken for the abnormal air sacs. ) in someone with severe emphysema the entire chest actually can enlarge. what probably happens is that the patient's extra (compensatory) efforts to suck in as much air as possible (to increase ventilation) contribute to enlarging the lungs and the chest. thus a person with severe emphysema often develops what has been described as a barrel-chest."

    "Answer": "in the beauty section of the los angeles times a recent article discussed how lines develop from not only sun exposure and aging but from animation. it talked about the treatments to deal with these lines. botox and dysport paralyze certain facial muscles and prevent the contraction that causes creases. we have a variety of fillers to plump the hollowness and grooves. there have been some recent additions including juvederm xc and hydrelle which contain local anesthetic to help reduce the pain during injection. however i will tell you that it takes a bit long for the painkiller to take effect and by that time the piercing of the skin is done. recently there has been some interest in stem cells that would augment fat transfer into the face. the article mentioned that “fatty tissue has the highest percentage of adult stem cells of any tissue in the body ” and that “adipose (fat) stem cells have the capacity of cell memory especially in the use of re-volumizing the face. ” my impression is that fat transfer is still not the preferred method because of the inconsistent results. sometimes the fat can shrink. sometimes it can get lumpy and that’s not what patients want. i prefer the man-made injectables because they have a very low incidence of lumps bumps and reaction. if they were to cause any trouble the filler will dissolve and disappear within several months. one of the doctors quoted in the article said “the difference between looking naturally beautiful and looking like a chipmunk is all in the technique. ” i wholeheartedly agree. the art form is as important as the product. technology alone is not enough to overcome lack of talent and judgment."

    "Question": "male pelvic pain frequent urination sometimes feels like there is a gas bubble in pelvis area. had unprotected sex started to have frequent urination the day after. went to clinic got tested for bladder infection ghonnorea/chlamdyia (multiple times) all came back negative. prescribed norfloxacin doxycycline levofloxacin and still have symptons. doxycycline seemed to work the best because symptons went away for about a week. have seen multiple doctors and none no what it is (have a urologist appt feb 11) just looking for some input on what it may be. have not had sex recently. no fever",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very uncomfortable. and i'm glad to hear you're seeing a specialist because you need to get to the bottom of what's going on. a couple of points. it's entirely possible the symptoms are unrelated to the unprotected sexual encounter. whenever we humans experience new symptoms we tend to want to attribute their cause to any recent unusual experience. however it's entirely possible for physical symptoms to arise independent of any coincidental event. when the lining of the bladder becomes irritated it can stay irritated for some time. when a person empties his bladder frequently it can allow the lining of the flaccid bladder to rub against itself which can cause further irritation. i suggest you try ignoring the urge to urinate frequently and instead allow your bladder to collect a fair amount of fluid before you let it out. although it may feel uncomfortable at the time you may discover it eventually gives you some relief. it's good news that you tested negative for various types of infections and that you have no fever. that pretty much rules out any infectious processes going on. i hope you get some answers from the urologist. i've worked with patients who had bladder symptoms like you describe and they eventually just cleared up on their own. maybe this will be the case for you too. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "how can i decrease my appetite?",
    "Answer": "let's say you've already had a healthy balanced meal so that you're not hungry (hunger is a physical phenomenon and tells the body \"i need food for survival\") but your appetite (appetite is a psychological phenomenon and is about \"i want food\" because it tastes great) get stirred up. that means you should be fine but you're getting tempted. here are a few things you can do to quell appetite and rein in over-eating: 1) brush your teeth and/or use mouth wash. that'll take the tastiness out of most foods. 2) if you have to have something eat something that expands your stomach with few calories--- a low cal soup lots of veggies. 3) stay completely away from any sugary foods. the refined sugar will cause your insulin to spike and you'll end up with a ravenous appetite for more. talk about shooting yourself in the foot! 4) get plenty of sleep! this keeps the levels of leptin (a hormone that helps you feel satisfied) high to help control appetite."

    "Question": "what is athlete's foot?",
    "Answer": "athlete's foot is a very common skin infection of the bottom of the feet caused by fungus. the fungus that most commonly causes athlete's foot is called trichophyton. when the feet or other areas of the body stay moist warm and become irritated fungus can thrive and infect the upper layers of the skin. fungal infections can occur almost anywhere on the body including the scalp trunk extremities (arms and legs) hands feet nails vagina mouth and groin. athlete's foot is caused by the ringworm fungus (\"tinea\" in medical jargon). athlete's foot is also called tinea pedis. the fungus that causes athlete's foot can be found on many locations including floors in gyms locker rooms swimming pools nail salons airport security lines and in socks and clothing. the fungus can also be spread directly from person to person or by contact with these objects. most people acquire fungus on the feet from walking barefoot on areas where someone else with athlete's foot has walked. some people are simply more prone to this condition while others seem relatively resistant to contracting it. it has been called \"jungle rot\" by those serving in wars including the vietnam war. however without proper growing conditions (a warm moist environment) the fungus may not easily infect the skin. up to 70% of the population may have athlete's foot at some time during their lives. some individuals are inherently more prone to recurrences during their lifetime."

    "Answer": "to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it."

    "Question": "can i cut bupropion 150mg in half?",
    "Answer": "i guess the answer to your question is: it depends on how much you're supposed to be taking. you should always take prescription medications exactly as prescribed. if you were prescribed bupropion 150mg daily then that is the dose you should take. if you are experiencing side effects or want to decrease the dosage for some other reason you should consult your healthcare provider. bupropion has two main uses: as an antidepressant and as an aid to quit smoking. it's almost always a bad idea to abruptly stop taking (or reduce the dosage of) an antidepressant medication. stopping bupropion is best done under the care of a physician or other healthcare professional. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "how can so little damage or so little of something cause mortality? . how can so little of something or so small a percentage of damage cause something as severe as mortality? for example dying from as little as 30% burns on your body (not from something more common sense -to me- like 50% or higher) or having 7% plaque blocking your arteries or even ingesting as little as 100 micrograms of mercury would kill you.",
    "Answer": "well each person is very different which means that each human body has different levels of tolerance. for example one person's body may be able to handle the 30% burns easier than others. the body could go into shock from any traumatic experience such as a burn or being exposed to mercury. the amount that the body can handle before going into shock is different for each person. you also have to take into consideration the health of the person. for example someone with healthy lungs usually has no complications recovering from bronchitis while someone with a condition such as asthma may have several complications because it is harder for the body to heal itself."

    "Question": "how does a messy bedroom affect my sleep?",
    "Answer": "believe it or not when you walk into a room what your eye sees can actually determine whether or not you’re going to have an easy time falling asleep or a bad time. so the first thing i tell people to do is clean up your bedroom. get the clutter out. because it’s pretty hard to fall asleep with a stack of laundry over here and a big pile of books over there and a very sort of jumbled night table okay. and so i talk to them about cleaning up the clutter getting that stuff out of the way so that when you walk in you’re more peaceful more serene surrounding. that may also have to do with color. so there are studies that look at what is the color of your bedroom and how can that affect your ability to fall asleep. it turned out that the color itself is not important but the hue of the color is. so the brightness of that color turns out to be a big factor. so when you’re painting your bedroom you don’t want a high gloss finish you want more of a matted finish. now granted a very bright yellow is probably not a great place to fall asleep but a more muted yellow probably is. so again it may not matter the color so much as the brightness of that color."

    "Question": "injured finger sliced open 6 stitches. cleaning properly and bandaged. fingertip is burning throbbing? is this normal? . stitches were put in about 72hrs (3days) ago. still very painful.",
    "Answer": "yes what you are experiencing may be considered as normal. it sounds like you are caring well for your injured finger. changing the bandages frequently and preventing infection is important. you only had the stich procedure 72 hours ago. the stiches will probably be removed within 7-10 days after their insertion. the laceration needs time to heal properly (usually about 3-4 weeks). the affected area was damaged and swelling most likely is present. as the swelling goes down the burning and pain will diminish along with any throbbing. perhaps you also sustained some superficial nerve assault which may take as long as 6-10 months to be resolved. in conclusion the damaged finger should heal virtually incident-free but needs more time than most people feel is necessary to recover from the injury. keep the area dry and clean (to prevent infection) by continuing to change the bandages take an analgesic every 4-6 hours for pain relief if not contraindicated do not overwork the lacerated area and have the stiches removed (and the healing assessed) upon your follow-up appointment."

    "Question": "what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "how can i help my newborn who has \"silent\" acid reflux? and how long does this last? . my son who is soon to be 3months old we thought had colic when things first started (at 2 1/2 weeks old) but then realized it was acid reflux. he also doesn't latch correctly when he nurses but is very healthy! gains weight with no problems but i know him not latching is has got to be related some how. he's always straight and stiff as a board <negative_smiley> makes gasping and many other noises that are not normal. i have 2 other children. i know. i need to find how i can help him! this breaks my heart!",
    "Answer": "babies often get reflux but it is rarely \"silent\". they cry and spit up and often do not thrive. your baby is thriving. as a matter of fact he may be so good at breast-feeding now that it only seems like he is not getting sufficient amounts but he is. the fact that he is healthy and gaining weight is proof he is getting plenty. if he over-eats or is encouraged to nurse more than he can handle he may throw up. true reflux is treated with prescription medicine like lansoprazole (prevacid) once it is properly diagnosed. it would be wise for you to openly discuss this with his pediatrician first before trying any home remedies. seasoned mothers will often suggest any number of them. most colic and even reflux will improve after age three months so brighter days may be in your near future."

    "Question": "precum in second time. is there any pre cum if i ejaculated n den immediately started again after properly washing. i mean in second time is there any precum? and it wasnt fully erected. how much the cases of getting preg in this situation? . i know there is some left over in the ducts. and that is what making some confusions. help me out",
    "Answer": "if you had a microscope you would most likely find viable sperm happily swimming around in just about any fluid coming from the penis including urine after an ejaculation. the fluid that you see at the beginning of sexual activity that you call \"precum\" is seminal fluid and that too can have live sperm. after ejaculation there is plenty of rogue sperm still viable in any post-coital drainage. as an effective birth-control measure it is always best to keep the penis sheathed in a condom when it is near a vagina."

    "Answer": "anyone with a colon can get colorectal cancer – a collective term that includes both colon cancer and rectal cancer. in the united states it’s the third most common serious cancer in men and women. it's estimated that over 24 000 men died from colorectal cancer in 2008 making it the third leading cause of cancer death in men after lung and prostate cancers. and new evidence suggests that men may benefit more than women from earlier colorectal cancer screening. overall only about 6% of men in the u. s. develop colorectal cancer but several factors increase your risk: age: men younger than 40 almost never develop colorectal cancer. over 90% of the cases are in men over 50. family history: if people in your immediate family or near relations had colorectal cancer at a young age you should be screened earlier. previous colorectal cancer: if you've had cancer removed already you're at higher risk to develop a new one. inflammatory bowel disease: if you have had a condition such as crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis for several years your risk of colorectal cancer goes up. other conditions that appear to raise the risk of colorectal cancer include: drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day obesity smoking diabetes a high-fat diet with fat coming mostly from meat."

    "Question": "how likely is it that i've been infected by genital herpes?",
    "Answer": "whether or not your partner has infected you with genital herpes depends on whether you have always practiced safe sex for one thing. also it may depend on how long you've been sexually intimate with each other. if you've had sex only once or twice and if you used a condom each time your risk of getting genital herpes is lower than if you've had unprotected sex for a long time. but you could have been infected during any one encounter. don't think you're in the clear because you've never seen herpes sores on your partner's genitals or your own. the symptoms of genital herpes are often subtle and easily mistaken for something else like bug bites pimples razor burn or hemorrhoids. what's more the virus can be contagious even when there are no symptoms."

    "Answer": "i wouldn't worry about this too much. it doesn't sound abnormal to me. different things \"turn on\" different people. maybe oral sex just isn't your thing. you can choose to analyze this and possibly discover why receiving oral sex makes you feel tense or you can choose to focus on engaging in sexual activities that give you pleasure. that's how it sizes up to me. as long as you're not having other sexual dysfunction problems you can be pretty confident the lack of orgasm during oral sex is merely an issue of personal preference. if you find this truly bothersome i'd suggest seeking out a counselor or psychotherapist with experience in sexual dysfunction. he or she should be able to help you sort this out pretty quickly. all the best to you!"

    "Answer": "hi a clear watery discharge from the vagina usually occurs when the cells of the cervix undergo certain changes known as cervical erosion. this is not a malignant or premalignant condition and usually occurs in response to estrogen or infection. since you are in permenopause the estrogen level is likely to be low. but what could be causing the discharge is a condition known as atrophic vaginitis or postmenopausal vaginitis together with cervical erosion. this condition usually occurs when the vaginal walls thin out due to low estrogen level. a reactive inflammation sets in in both the cerix and the vagina and you may get the thin clear discharge which you now have. i do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014. hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around november/december 2014. then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them."

    "Answer": "this issue has come up many times on webmd's ear nose and throat community and there is a few things you can try. you are correct. the weight of your head on your pillow is either restricting circulation to your outer ear (pinna) or you are causing some nerve compression. you can adjust your sleeping position to avoid this over-compression but old habits are hard to break. an ent colleague suggested that you get a foam pillow and cut out an ear-sized crater in it. this way your ear can rest in a little bed of it's own without causing undo compression. it may work but this is not something you can buy. you will need to make it. the worst that can happen is that it will not help . you can try softer pillows or pillows of different shapes as well. some people will sleep on the other side of the bed so they will tend to turn their head a different way. even if you slept with your wrist flexed under the pillow you could wake up with a numb tingling hand so the the only answer to this problem is either changing your sleep position or creating that special pillow."

    "Question": "what is cryotherapy for prostate cancer?",
    "Answer": "cryotherapy is one of the newer treatments that is being evaluated for use in the early stage of prostate cancer. this treatment kills the cancer cells by freezing them. the freezing is accomplished by inserting a freezing liquid (for example liquid nitrogen or argon) through needles directly into the prostate gland. the procedure is accomplished under the guidance of ultrasound images. actually cryotherapy is not a new technique. rather it is a modification of a procedure that was tried previously but had an unacceptably high rate of complications. thus cryotherapy was used in the 1960s to freeze the lining of the stomach to treat ulcers but was discontinued because it also severely damaged the lining of the stomach. at present cryotherapy is recommended for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who for whatever reason are not candidates for the more established treatments. cryotherapy is further being studied to determine which other patients might benefit from this treatment. for example studies are under way to establish whether cryotherapy is beneficial as an initial treatment for organ-confined (localized) prostate cancer. the effectiveness of cryotherapy in eliminating prostate cancer however has not yet been proven. we do know that sometimes the freezing liquid fails to kill all of the cancer cells. moreover the potential side effects of this treatment include damage to the urethra and bladder. this damage can cause obstruction (blockage) of the urethra fistulas (abnormal tunnels) that leak urine or serious infections."

    "Answer": "any child below 3 months of age who has a temperature of 100. 4 f (38 c) or greater should be seen by a physician or other health-care worker. if a child or adult has a history or diagnosis of cancer aids or other serious illness such as heart disease diabetes or is taking immunosuppressant drugs medical care should be sought for a fever. otherwise observe the person with the fever. if they appear sick or have symptoms that would suggest a major illness such as meningitis (headache stiff neck confusion problems staying awake) urinary tract infection (shaking chills burning with urination) pneumonia (shortness of breath cough) or any other signs of a serious illness contact your health-care provider. other symptoms that may be indicative of a severe illness include repeated vomiting severe diarrhea or skin rashes (could be a sign of dengue fever rocky mountain spotted fever scarlet fever rheumatic fever or chickenpox). fever blisters (herpangina) are small blisters that turn into ulcers usually on the lips mouth or tongue that are caused by a virus. when a child contracts this virus for the first time the symptoms and the fever blisters can be quite severe. if the child is not eating or drinking contact your child's health-care provider. on the other hand if the fever accompanies a simple cold or virus you can treat the fever as described above and be assured that the fever is only a symptom of the illness. this is not to say that you should ignore a fever. if there are other associated symptoms that are bothersome you should contact your health-care professional. some vaccines given in childhood can cause a low-grade fever within a day or two of getting the injection. this fever is usually self-limited and short-lived. if the reaction seems severe or the skin at the injection site is red hot and painful contact your child's doctor. about 3% of all children between 18 months to 3 years of age will have a seizure (convulsion) with a high fever. of those with a history of febrile seizure approximately one-third will have another seizure associated with another febrile episode. febrile seizures while frightening to the parents are not associated with long-term nervous-system side effects. children used to be prescribed phenobarbital following a febrile seizure as a preventive measure (prophylaxis). this has not been shown to be beneficial and possibly may be harmful so it is not always recommended."

    "Question": "can sleep deprivation impair my judgment?",
    "Answer": "innocent by sleep-deprived insanity. that’s what one man is saying in one of the strangest trials of the year (maybe even the decade). when i read about it i dug a little deeper only to find that the details of the trial were even more complicated than the claim of innocence. here are the facts of the case (pretend you’re in the jury box): * woody smith of dayton kentucky strangled his wife to death in may of last year. * police records indicate that smith learned about his wife’s extra-martial affair and confronted her just before attacking her. * he was then hospitalized for an overdose of prescription pills. * his defense attorneys claim the violence occurred due to insanity brought on by lack of sleep as smith was allegedly having trouble sleeping because he was worried that his wife would leave him. * according to his lawyers smith was taking caffeine pills and drinking energy drinks to get him through the day. from my standpoint there are two questions to address here: * can you really become psychotic or delusional from sleep deprivation? * how can caffeine or energy drinks play into one’s propensity to kill another human being? first sleep deprivation itself can indeed impair someone’s judgment and ability to think clearly but that doesn’t necessarily lead to committing a murder. second it doesn’t surprise me to learn that perpetrators of crimes have laid blame on lots of things to justify claims of insanity. and when used in an overdosage situation caffeine can produce paranoid delusional behavior. while i do not know all of the specifics of this case i would find it hard to believe that the “red bull” made him do it. and you might recall me blogging about the story of kenneth parks who killed his mother-in-law while he was sleepwalking. he was found not guilty but then again… it’s not the same as killing someone while wide awake. though for someone like mr. smith he’s facing the possibility of a life sentence that no amount of restful sleep can take away. we’ll have to see what happens here."

    "Answer": "assuming you haven't traveled to any third-world countries recently it's highly unlikely you have a parasite in your gums. it's much more likely you have something lodged in there such as a popcorn hull. if your gum is very swollen it naturally is going to move (yield) when you push on it with your finger. if the swelling is caused by an abscessed tooth then you could feel fluid moving around under the skin. if the situation doesn't clear up on its own within a couple of days or if you begin experiencing severe pain a high fever and/or discharge from the swollen area then a trip to the dentist is in order. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what does ph balance mean?",
    "Answer": "ph is a measure of how acidic a water-based solution is. since our bodies are mostly water ph can be used to describe how much acid is in the fluids in our bodies. water has a ph of 7. 0. phs lower than 7 are acidic; phs above 7 are basic or alkaline. our bodies maintain our blood at a ph of about 7. 4. the kidneys tightly regulate this ph balance by continuously filtering the acids and bases in the blood. the kidneys excrete just the right amount of acid or base in the urine to keep the system in ph balance. certain other body fluids are highly acidic (like stomach acid) or basic (enzyme-rich fluids in the pancreas). these fluids are kept tightly walled off from the blood and body tissues where they could cause damage if released inappropriately."

    "Question": "what are the complications of acid reflux also known as gerd?",
    "Answer": "ulcers the liquid from the stomach that refluxes into the esophagus damages the cells lining the esophagus. an ulcer is simply a break in the lining of the esophagus that occurs in an area of inflammation. ulcers and the additional inflammation they provoke may erode into the esophageal blood vessels and give rise to bleeding into the esophagus. occasionally the bleeding is severe and may require: blood transfusions. an endoscopic procedure (in which a tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to visualize the site of bleeding and to stop the bleeding). surgical treatment. strictures ulcers of the esophagus heal with the formation of scars (fibrosis). over time the scar tissue shrinks and narrows the lumen (inner cavity) of the esophagus. this scarred narrowing is called a stricture. swallowed food may get stuck in the esophagus once the narrowing becomes severe enough. this situation may necessitate endoscopic removal of the stuck food. then to prevent food from sticking the narrowing must be stretched (widened). barrett's esophagus longstanding and/or severe gerd causes changes in the cells that line the esophagus in some patients. these cells are precancerous and finally become cancerous. this condition is referred to as barrett's esophagus and occurs in approximately 10% of patients with gerd. the type of esophageal cancer associated with barrett's esophagus (adenocarcinoma) is increasing in frequency. it is not clear why some patients with gerd develop barrett's esophagus but most do not. cough and asthma many nerves are in the lower esophagus. some of these nerves are stimulated by the refluxed acid and this stimulation results in pain (usually heartburn). other nerves that are stimulated do not produce pain. instead they stimulate yet other nerves that provoke coughing. in this way refluxed liquid can cause coughing without ever reaching the throat! in a similar manner reflux into the lower esophagus can stimulate esophageal nerves that connect to and can stimulate nerves going to the lungs. these nerves to the lungs then can cause the smaller breathing tubes to narrow resulting in an attack of asthma. inflammation of the throat and larynx if refluxed liquid gets past the upper esophageal sphincter it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx). the resulting inflammation can lead to a sore throat and hoarseness. as with coughing and asthma it is not clear just how commonly gerd is responsible for otherwise unexplained inflammation of the throat and larynx. inflammation and infection of the lungs refluxed liquid that passes the larynx can enter the lungs. the reflux of liquid into the lungs (called aspiration) often results in coughing and choking. aspiration however can also occur without producing these symptoms. with or without these symptoms aspiration may lead to infection of the lungs and result in pneumonia. this type of pneumonia is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. when aspiration is unaccompanied by symptoms it can result in a slow progressive scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis) that can be seen on chest x-rays. fluid in the sinuses and middle ears the throat communicates with the nasal passages. in small children two patches of lymph tissue called the adenoids are located where the upper part of the throat joins the nasal passages. the passages from the sinuses and the tubes from the middle ears (eustachian tubes) open into the rear of the nasal passages near the adenoids. refluxed liquid that enters the upper throat can inflame the adenoids and cause them to swell. when the sinuses and middle ears are closed off from the nasal passages by the swelling of the adenoids fluid accumulates within them. this accumulation of fluid can lead to discomfort in the sinuses and ears."

    "Answer": "it's time to see your doctor if you have acid reflux symptoms two or more times a week or if medications don't bring lasting relief. symptoms such as heartburn are the key to the diagnosis of acid reflux disease especially if lifestyle changes antacids or acid-blocking medications help reduce these symptoms. your doctor may order one or more tests to confirm a diagnosis and check for other problems: barium swallow (esophagram) can check for ulcers or a narrowing of the esophagus. esophageal manometry can check the function of the esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter. endoscopy can check for problems in your esophagus or stomach. a biopsy may be taken during endoscopy to check samples of tissue under a microscope for infection or abnormalities."

    "Question": "my friend 5 months pregnant and a drug addict is it safe to just stop using when shes this far long? . she uses cocaine frequently",
    "Answer": "the best thing for both mom and baby is to be very honest with the doctor about all substance use. the sooner this happens the quicker the individual can get the drugs out of their body and focus on preparing for when the baby arrives. during prenatal care the ob-gyn may make a recommendation for how to best address drug use and which method of drug detox is the safest for mom and baby. it is important to note that drug use is not limited to illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin but also includes prescription drug abuse as well as over-the-counter drugs. the doctor may suggest that the patient enter a medical drug detox facility to remove the chemical toxins that have accumulated from drug abuse. there are many different options for medical drug detox and the doctor may suggest a preferred method safe for both mom and baby. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."

    "Question": "what is the cause of scarred lungs? . i have been sick for over one month with asthma had 2 chest xrays to rule out pneumonia. good news no fluid or pneumonia but longs show scarring. i am still short of breath coughing up yellow phlem. so what causes scarred lungs could that be my problem?",
    "Answer": "i have lung problems myself and i found that i have nodules on my lungs and i also spit up a lot of phlem and i also have a pulmonary doctor that told me that i had bronchitis and emphysema. my nodules are not very big now but he will recheck them in 6 months. ask your doctor if you don't get to feeling better for a ct scan which will show more than an x-ray. the scarring could be from air pollution or pneumonia or emphysema or bronchitis or smoking. even if you have been around someone who has smoked all of their lives and you have inhaled a great deal of that smoke you will feel the effects after so long a time. my doctor put me on allbuterol it is a spray that i use whenever i feel like i can't breathe. i am also taking symbicort which is also a spray that i use for asthma related cough also maintenance treatment for my copd. it has helped me but i don't know if you could benefit. that is why i said you should have a ct scan of your lungs so that your doctor can really see how bad your lungs really is. and if you are short of breathe and sprays do not help i would suggest going to a cardiologist because anytime someone has a problem with shortness of breathe its either the lungs or the heart. maybe both. but i do suggest you go back to your doctor and ask for a ct scan or see if he will prescribe the allbuterol or symbicort to see if they will help. but i won't you to look up the side effects of any medicine that he gives you. only you will know if it is best for you to take. and don't take it just because it helped me take it only if you decide that you trust your doctor and if it is best for you to take. please let us know how you are doing and i would like to know how you are feeling. please keep us informed of your status. i do hope that you get to feeling better. thank you"

    "Question": "i had strong allergic reactions twice after eating shellfish and then fish when i was physically active. why is that?",
    "Answer": "i recommend that you see an allergist to fully evaluate these episodes. bring with you a list of all foods consumed on the days that you experienced adverse reactions. sometimes these reactions can be random but other are linked to foods. food allergy typically occurs with each exposure and can present as itching hives lip/tongue swelling nausea vomiting or passing out. food allergy reactions can be severe. there are rare forms of food allergy that only occur with the combination of eating and exercise. the allergist can help evaluate these and give you instructions in regards to your diet timing of exercise and likely administer an epi pen."

    "Question": "is lupus hereditary?",
    "Answer": "lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is a condition of chronic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. the precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. inherited genes viruses ultraviolet light and drugs may all play some role. the genes some people inherit seem to increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases and autoimmune diseases such as lupus rheumatoid arthritis and immune thyroid disorders are more common among relatives of patients with lupus than the general population. some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus patients is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. sometimes symptoms of lupus can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure. research provides direct evidence that a key enzyme's failure to dispose of dying cells contributes to sle. accordingly a genetic mutation that disrupts the body's cellular waste disposal may be involved in the beginning of sle."

    "Answer": "when you think of sweet potatoes i hope the first thing that comes to mind is not the thanksgiving version that is steeped in sugar and topped with marshmallows! if this is your only familiarity with this vegetable i don’t think you have had a proper representation on what this delicious root vegetable can bring to a meal. depending on what part of the country you are in you may see sweet potatoes interchanged with “yam. ” in some places sweet potatoes are white-fleshed and not very sweet. the type i love are also referred to as garnet yams which are a rich yellow-orange color with a brownish skin. sweet potatoes are considered one of the most nutritional vegetables around (if they aren’t soaked in sugar and marshmallows of course! ). they are an excellent source of vitamin a and also boast vitamin c and manganese. in addition sweet potatoes are a good source of copper dietary fiber vitamin b6 potassium and iron. this vegetable has been consumed for at least 10 000 years (sweet potato parts found in peruvian caves have been dated that old). besides the sweet flavor and great source of fiber nutrition that sweet potatoes bring to the table i love how versatile they are. they can be cooked pureed and mixed into pancakes in the morning. yes pancakes! they can be part of a great soup at lunch. also by cutting them into cubes and steaming or roasting then chilling you can add them to salads. or how about this: for lunch one day i reheated some roasted sweet potato spears from dinner the night before added a bit of sesame kale leftover rotisserie chicken and rolled into a sprouted corn tortilla for an unusual taco that my friend kristen still swears is one of her favorite things i’ve ever made. here’s one of the simplest preparations for sweet potatoes: heat your oven to 450 degrees. cut them into one-inch wedges toss them with extra virgin olive oil a bit of soy sauce salt and pepper and roast on a sheet pan until soft (make sure there is space around the spears or they will steam as they cook). they cook much quicker this way then if you were to bake them whole and the flavor is fantastic. so next time you’re at the store and considering buying some plain old russet potatoes why not switch it up and try out the flavorful and nutritious sweet potato?"

    "Answer": "implantation bleeding can last longer than 12 days. it maybe considered something else after so long but that is what my dr. called it. i am not writing this because i think i know more than what wmd gave as an answer. however as a first time pregnant woman who has experienced light bleeding and cramping intermittently from week 3rd through my current 7th week i believe there is not enough information available about 1st trimester bleeding. i read so many articles like this that my head was swimming. i knew i wasn't having a miscarriage but what i was reading (all from credible sources btw) left me feeling like i was either doomed to miscarry or i would be bed ridden. when i went in for an ultra sound the nurse pointed out a little dark area between the amniotic sac and my uterine wall. she said that is where the blood was coming from. at 7w1d i was still experiencing implantation bleeding- it was still attaching in an area. she said it is common and everything was fine! i saw my little button wiggle and we heard a heart beat! baby measures perfectly. not every story is going to end quite as uncomplicated but i want women to have hope. there are a lot of answers- every pregnancy is different. talk to your dr. and never ever assume the worst. there is hope!"

    "Answer": "i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an \"expert\" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail."

    "Question": "are there reasons to take birth control pills besides preventing pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "most women will use birth control pills at some time in their lives. but many women don’t know that birth control pills also can be used to treat a variety of female problems and can have some surprising health benefits. birth control pills are made of synthetic (laboratory derived) versions of the two ovarian hormones: progesterone and estradiol. also birth control pills can contain synthetic forms of both hormones or progesterone (progestin) only. progestin-only pills are best for women who should not or do not want to take estrogen but are not used as much because they have a higher rate of causing unpredictable vaginal bleeding for at least the first year. to understand how birth control pills affect periods it is helpful to understand how the normal menstrual cycle works. a menstrual period takes place when the uterus (womb) sheds its lining; this process is controlled by the hormones made by the ovary (estrogen and progesterone). a menstrual cycle begins with the first day of the period lasts for about one month and is divided into two halves by ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). during the first half of the cycle only estrogen is made. under the influence of estrogen the uterine lining grows to prepare for a potential pregnancy. during the second half of the cycle after ovulation progesterone is also made. progesterone stops the lining from growing and prepares it for implantation of an embryo. if pregnancy does not occur progesterone and estrogen levels fall which triggers the shedding of the uterine lining and the next period begins. some common uses include regulation of menstrual periods treatment of irregular periods treatment of painful periods and treatment for acne hirsutism (excess hair) and alopecia (hair loss). you can find more information from the american society for reproductive medicine on this topic here: <link> yes. birth control pills can help manage severe acne (acne that is worsened by hormonal swings) in women (of course) birth control pills can help regulate the menstrual cycle in women who have terrible unpredictable crampy or heavy periods. a regular predictable cycle for these women is a blessing. girls who are competitive athletes appreciate the predictability of regular periods. birth control pills prevent ovulation so women who have a tendency to get painful ovarian cysts or have ovulation pain can benefit from not ovulating for a while. finally birth control pills help some parents sleep better. if you have a daughter who may be secretly sexually active or may become sexually involved in the near future the birth control pill is a highly effective contraceptive for those teens who do not. or forget to use condoms. preaching abstinence has its limitations so parents sleep better knowing that the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is very very remote."

    "Question": "do low-tech methods such as breast self-exam and a doctor's breast exam help detect breast cancer?",
    "Answer": "many of the largest studies to show no benefit for breast self-exam (bse) were done in countries outside the u. s. (such as shanghai china in 2002 and russia in 2003). in addition to no decrease in breast cancer deaths the largest studies showed an increased number of biopsies which found no cancer. it is difficult to know if the outcome would be the same if a woman was instructed using the newest bse technique taught to gynecologists in the u. s. the issues surrounding the clinical breast exams (cbe) done by doctors are similar. there is a large canadian study which suggested five-year survival rates were the same in women who received only cbe and those who received cbe plus screening mammogram. one of the current discussions explores the quality of cbe. there are several techniques used; and some mds do a more thorough and systemic breast exam than their colleagues."

    "Answer": "you should have a pre-op appointment with your surgeon's nurse (or physician assistant) and/or a nurse at the facility where your knee replacement will occur. these nurses should answer all your questions about pre-operative medication regimens whether or not to take lantus the day of your surgery when to stop eating before surgery and so on. in general people with blood sugar problems can experience longer healing times. i'd recommend asking your surgeon (or his/her nurse or physician assistant) what to expect in terms of possible problems healing. because your a1c is good you may not experience any problems at all. be sure to follow all your surgeon's printed instructions for post-op care of the wound. i suggest you write down all your questions for the pre-op appointment. be sure you receive printed instructions for before and after the surgery. if any of your questions aren't answered in advance feel free to call your surgeon's office for clarification. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of whooping cough?",
    "Answer": "it starts like a cold with congestion and upper respiratory symptoms. after a week or so a cough develops. the cough worsens over several days and the coughing fits may be so severe that you can't stop or catch your breath. a coughing fit may be followed by a “whoop” as the person gasps to catch their breath. it's these coughing fits called paroxysms which cause doctors to be worried about pertussis and try to confirm the diagnosis. in people who have been vaccinated or who have had pertussis before the symptoms may be nonspecific. pertussis is high on the list if that whoop is present but if it’s absent pertussis may go unrecognized. it’s important to know that infants with pertussis don’t always cough. in young babies the first sign of pertussis may be difficulty breathing or pauses in breathing that last more than 20 seconds called “apnea. ” apnea is serious and requires immediate medical attention. for our infant (4mo) daughter it started like a pretty normal cough. 5 days later the cough had only gotten worse. it went from one or two of the infant \"double cough\" pairs up to runs of 6 or 8 double cough pairs lasting more like ten seconds. we took her to a walk-in clinic for a persussis swab that day but she stopped breathing that night and turned blue. we called the ambulance and it was a close call but still it's quite crazy how quickly it escalated. if you don't hear the telltale \"whoop\" it can still be pertussis! the whoop didn't show up for us until after we had the apnea episodes and were already checked into the hospital. the $50 or whatever for a walk-in clinic could save your childs life. if you end up in the hospital for a week like we did it'll cost a lot more than that anyway. if an infant is 6mo or older i wouldn't be quick to run fearfully to the clinic but for young ones it's well worth the cautionary checkup if your child has had a cough for more than a few days."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. gastroenteritis is no fun! of course i'm obligated to tell you that smoking marijuana is illegal except in states that allow medical marijuana usage and then only with a valid prescription. so i can't really comment on the effect of marijuana on symptoms of gastroenteritis other than to say the medical community really doesn't know the effect of marijuana on many conditions because the substance hasn't been studied all that much. as to your gastroenteritis you need to be aware it is contagious. if you work in a food-handling environment for example you should not return to work. if necessary have your manager speak to your doctor to explain why it's a bad idea for you to return to work until your gastroenteritis has completely cleared up. if you insist on going back to work it's imperative you wash your hands frequently with warm soapy water. do not share eating utensils towels or other objects with co-workers. disinfect all food preparation areas and surfaces you touch frequently. it would be a good idea for you to inform your co-workers about the gastroenteritis so they can join with you in washing their hands frequently in order to avoid transmitting this illness among the staff and customers. i hope you feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "there are two possibilities. first you may have completely packed your wax-filled ear against the eardrum. in this case your eardrum cannot move and thus your hearing would be diminished. second you may have ruptured your eardrum or at the very least caused trauma to the eardrum (even if you did not see any blood). for a wax impaction a warm water lavage would likely remove the packed wax however if the integrity of your eardrum has been disrupted (requires an otoscopic exam by a medical professional) washing out your ear would be contraindicated. an ent or a trained professional would need to carefully remove the wax impaction stop using q-tips! they are dangerous and earwax is not dirt. it is a beneficial protective coating for the ear canal."

    "Answer": "we cannot change our genetics age or number of vaginal births! sadly there are not many scientific studies testing different forms of pelvic organ prolapse prevention. the strategies for prevention that are most often suggested include: kegel exercises up to four times daily. the hope is that by strengthening muscles in the pelvic floor that those muscles can help delay or reduce the onset of prolapse. physical exercise. regular exercise can help keep one's body weight down and being overweight is linked to prolapse. exercise is also reputed to keep muscles and ligaments more flexible. decrease straining to have a bowel movement. constipation or having to bear down increases pressure in the abdomen which \"pushes down\" on pelvic organs. eating a healthy diet with whole grains fruits and vegetable not only helps constipation but can improve body weight. treat chronic coughs. if one is a smoker -- quit. if there is another reason for a chronic cough -- have it treated. a cough increases the pressure inside the abdomen which can \"push down\" on pelvic organs. there are studies linking smoking with poorer tissue integrity after pelvic organ prolapse repair. use a correct technique for heavy lifting. straining to lift increases pressure within the abdomen. hysterectomy surgery considerations. if one is having a hysterectomy there are studies which suggest that attaching the uterine ligaments to the top of the vagina may help to keep the vagina from dropping down."

    "Answer": "it definitely does sound thyroid related but there could be other factors at play here. if you have access to a good endocrinologist talk to them. the trouble with hyperthyroidism is that it's rather difficult to control - one of the only cures known is to kill part of the thyroid. that may be why your doctor is having trouble. some people take saw palmetto to help stop hair loss but talk to your doctor before trying that because it might affect your medications. it sounds like you have two causes of your hair loss. the hyper thyroid is one and testosterone is the other - good old male pattern baldness. the propecia is working by blocking some of the effects of the testosterone that's what saw palmetto does too. perhaps you can devise a combination therapy and get better results. if all else fails though keep in mind that a totally bald man can be very attractive especially if he is otherwise healthy and strong. it can be a very good look so you may end up wanting to embrace that."

    "Answer": "affecting men and women equally about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis may develop at any age but usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50. while the cause is not known genetic factors along with the immune system likely play a role in determining who will develop the disorder. as many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. having a parent with psoriasis triples the chance of getting psoriasis yourself and thus increases the chance of developing psoriatic arthritis."

    "Question": "i feel like i need to go to the toilet but i can't.? . i took a laxative 2 days ago and i had diarrhea for 2-3 times that day. yesterday i had one normal stool and now i have the feeling like i need to go to the toilet but there's nothing. are my intestines empty and that's why i can't poop? i eat normal meals these days. i'm a little bit scared help?",
    "Answer": "sounds like your stools are just a bit out of wack. a laxative can cause diarrhea so that part is normal. the question is why did you think you needed one? to get your stools back on track increase your daily amount of fiber. that means more fruit veggies whole grains and beans in your diet. if you start eating these at every meal you should see an improvment in a few days to a werek. if you just can't stomach those types of foods there are plenty of otc supplements that are inexpensive and and work well for most people. ask your pharmacist to show you some examples. if your problems last longer than a month or you notice black tar like stools see your doctor."

    "Answer": "an expectorant causes you to cough. i am sure that your two-year old is doing just fine in that department. coughing is important because it helps your child clear her airway. an expectorant will only increase the amount of mucous that she will need to clear and she is unable to spit it out. this may cause her to vomit. personally i would not recommend that you use it unless her doctor specifically okayed it."

    "Answer": "in general i would say you should ask your doctor about this the next time you have an appointment. sometimes a lingering bruise can signal a health problem but that's relatively unusual - and it's usually not a single \"bruise\" but multiple bruises over time. and you've been living with this mark for years. there are a number of reasons why this particular spot could be warm to the touch. perhaps it's a knot of blood vessels very near the surface of the skin. that would likely be a bit warm. one thing it's probably not is a deep vein thrombosis (dvt). you can't see these (they are located below layers of muscle in the calf) though a classic symptom of dvt is a hot flushed appearance on the skin. your description doesn't match this scenario at all. whenever you're in doubt about something don't hesitate to ask your doctor. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "a study from denmark’s center for healthy aging and the danish center for sleep medicine among other places explains how dreams may hold the clue that people may be on track to develop parkinson’s. researchers found that one of the earliest symptoms of parkinson’s may be a rem sleep disorder known as rem sleep behavior disorder (rbd). there are a few things that happen with rbd: usually when we sleep the body shuts down our muscle movement during rem sleep so that we can’t act out our dreams in people with rbd this shut-down doesn’t happen in this case people have dreams that are very vivid and violent compelling them to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. interestingly rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and is more likely to happen in men than in women. this highly active dreaming can appear up to eight years before the onset of other symptoms of parkinson’s so researchers are eager to see if they can use this to help patients before the disease becomes too severe. the next step is for scientists to see if rbd is always a sign of parkinson’s or if active dreaming could be a benign trait. in addition to being a possible early sign of parkinson’s rbd prevents people from getting restful sleep mostly because they are so active during their dreams."

    "Question": "what can i do to treat ringworm of the scalp or beard at home?",
    "Answer": "you usually treat ringworm of the scalp or beard with antifungal pills prescribed by a doctor. shampoos available without a prescription are helpful if you use them along with prescription pills. but when they are used alone they cannot completely destroy all of the fungi causing the infection. if you have ringworm of the scalp or beard: be sure to complete the full course of any prescribed medicine or follow the directions for products available without a prescription. they often require use for a period of time after symptoms go away. wash your hair or beard 2 or 3 times a week with shampoo that contains selenium sulfide or ketoconazole. in severe scalp fungal infections wash your scalp daily and wear a cap. you should boil the cap after you use it. 2 as soon as you start treatment throw away your combs and brushes and buy new ones. you will most likely see your doctor again after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. your doctor will also want to see you after you have finished all your medicine. follow the suggestions for preventing ringworm such as keeping your skin clean and dry and not sharing hats combs or brushes with others. ask your doctor whether your family members need to be tested. family members can use an antifungal shampoo with selenium sulfide in it (such as selsun blue or head and shoulders intensive treatment) to prevent the spread of infection. you do not need to keep your child out of school if he or she is taking pills to treat ringworm of the scalp. although parents sometimes use a special shampoo to help prevent the spread to other children it is not needed. and you do not need to shave your child's head. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "is it dangerous to get pregnant while taking yaz contaception. i have been taking the pill continuously for two years. i have never been late and i have no pregnancy symptoms except my stomach looks bigger. . i had a pap smear in mid november two regular periods in december and january. my last regular period was two weeks ago. . i took a pregnancy test in mid december that was negative. i just took another one and it came up positive immediately. i am now concerned that the baby may have birth defects due to taking yaz?",
    "Answer": "if you have routinely taken your birth control pills with no lapses it would be very rare indeed to become pregnant. but not impossible. you should see a gynecologist immediately for a serum pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant. no one who is pregnant should take birth control pills but you do not give any indication of being pregnant other than your perception that your abdomen looks larger. normally this is not a sign of very early pregnancy. under typical circumstances a woman's pregnancy doesn't start showing for at least four or five weeks. again though just to be safe you should get to a doctor's office as soon as possible to find out for sure what's going on. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "what kinds of doctors evaluate and treat infertility?",
    "Answer": "obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) can evaluate and treat infertility in women. ob-gyns specialize in general medical care of women including care related to pregnancy and the reproductive tract. urologists who specialize in the urinary tract and the male reproductive organs can evaluate and treat infertility in men. more resistant and complex problems are typically handled by \"fertility specialists \" board-certified reproductive endocrinologists who have completed training in obstetrics and gynecology followed by specialized training in hormonal problems and infertility. one example of a complex problem is a history of failure to conceive despite regular unprotected intercourse in a woman who has regular menstrual periods and whose male partner has normal sperm. other examples of complex problems include a woman who has experienced multiple miscarriages or who has severely damaged fallopian tubes requiring the need for treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (art)--the joining of eggs and sperm in a lab so that fertilization can occur. the decision about when to ask for a referral to a fertility specialist is a personal one. experts say that couples should consider the age of the woman the complexity of their problems and how they are feeling about the progress of their treatment. consumers should be proactive about asking their doctors for a referral to a specialist and about investigating the qualifications of the specialist. a certificate of special qualification in reproductive endocrinology and infertility from the american board of obstetrics and gynecology ensures that the specialist has completed a rigorous course of training."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer based on your story you are highly highly unlikely to get pregnant in this way. sperm may look like tadpoles but they do not remain viable for very long in the mouth/throat and any expectorate that flowed past your genital area in the shower an hour later would not have the potential of cause you to become pregnant. swallowed semen cannot result in a pregnancy and even if there was a stray super-sperm that flowed past your vaginal area it would be a one in a zillion chance that it would squiggle up your vagina through your uterus and make it to a viable egg (assuming your were ovulating at the time. you are engaging in sexual activity which tends to escalate to more risky behavior in the future so you would be wise to use effective contraception from now on."

    "Answer": "number one your doctor prescribed u. 25 mg of xanex not 25-mg. 25 mg would kill just about anyone. also idk where u get off saying that it will be out of your system in 6-8 hours when the half life of xanex is 11 hours meaning only half the pill is left in your system after 11 hours. so if you took a bar which is 2-mg than in 11 hours u would have 1-mg in your system so you would have even more than that after only 6-8 hours. the half life keeps getting divided in half after 11 hours but i know drug tests test for the levels of nanograms left in your system which i am pretty sure 1000 nanograms equal 1-mg so do the math yourself if you are that worried and see how many nanograms you need for a minimum to fail which is a lot more than the 1mg. in my example. my example is only for someome taking a 1 single 1mg pill for 1 day. if you took lage amounts multiple days or months because and built it up in your system. please people dont belive all this bs they actually have drug calculators online to input how many drugs u have taken and how long will it take to get out of your sytem by asking questions of your weight and health and it gives you a good round about estimate on how fast your halflife for that type of pill and gives. you a lot more acvurate than i saw one person say 8 hours and some people saying 6-8 weeks. it really all depending on your health (being overweight) and than how fast ur motabalism is. and obviously on high of a dose and how long he has been them because by taking high doses and for a lomg period of time will build the meds up in your system making it take that much longer to get it out. its not just the last pill you have to worry about it is how much you have build up on your body."

(be sure to get your doctor's permission before starting any exercise program. ) going back to \"calories in versus calories out \" you need not starve yourself. you can either choose to eat less food to decrease your calorie intake or you can choose to exercise more to increase your calories burned. either approach will work. you'll find a lot of good advice in webmd's weight loss and diet plans center. the road to weight loss and a healthy lifestyle can be slow and filled with setbacks. don't get discouraged! remember this is a lifelong journey. you've already taken the most important first step! wishing you all the best."

    "Answer": "first welcome to answers! second i'd like to invite you to join webmd's diet community where you can connect with other people trying to lose weight. your current plan is unsustainable because you're burning more calories (1400 a day) than you're taking in (1000 per day). the numbers need to be reversed. you need to take in a minimum amount of calories per day simply to survive. most people should not eat fewer than 1200 calories per day (and in my opinion that's very low). and that's without any exercise at all. you can use webmd's bmi calculator plus to get a personalized calorie intake plan for weight loss. in general to lose weight safely you should add the number of calories you burn from exercise to your minimum calorie intake to see the total number of calories you should consume. here's an example: burn 500 calories per day + 1200 calories minimum intake = consume 1700 calories total. you can fudge that number a little to lose weight faster or slower. by the way it's very difficult to burn 1400 calories per day unless you're already an elite athlete. you might need to revise your expectations in terms of exercise. best wishes to you! remember weight loss is a journey."

    "Question": "how can i reduce the risk of a serious medical error in the doctor's office?",
    "Answer": "here are a few precautions suggested by the agency of healthcare research and quality (ahrq) that you can take to protect yourself against common medical mistakes. take an active role: talk with your doctor and clearly state how you'd like your care to go and ask specific questions about the care you're receiving why it's necessary and what you should expect. talk medicine: it's critical that your doctors and nurses know all of the medications you're taking including over-the-counter drugs and vitamins and any other supplements. if it makes it easier for you bring all of your medication bottles in a bag to your doctor. mention any allergies you have. in addition ahrq suggests talking with your doctor about the medications being prescribed so that you clearly understand what you're taking how it should be taken and why it's important. here is a list of suggested questions to ask your doctor: what is the medicine for? how am i supposed to take it and for how long? what side effects are likely? what do i do if they occur? is this medicine safe to take with other medicines or dietary supplements i am taking? what food drink or activities should i avoid while taking this medicine? finally make sure you can read any prescriptions your doctor writes for you. if you can't read it there's no reason to think your pharmacist will be able to. spread the word: assume that each new doctor you see doesn't know your full medical history because he or she likely doesn't. and talk with your primary doctor about taking charge of your care and coordinating with other health care providers you see. ask for results: never assume that not hearing results about a recent medical test you've taken means that nothing was found. always call to find out exactly what the outcome was. bring a friend: it's a good idea to have a friend or family member who can advocate for you and help you ask questions."

    "Answer": "the thyroid is not under your chin. it is in your neck. unfortunately since i can't see those lumps. feel those lumps. i cannot blindly determine their nature based solely on your vague description. if those lumps are shallow and moveable under your skin and you feel they are related to your acne they could be acne cysts. you would need to see your medical provider or a dermatologist to be sure."

    "Answer": "there is virtually no medical condition that will keep you from doing any type of exercise. even people with congestive heart failure -- who were long told not to exercise at all -- can benefit from moderate amounts of activity. and people with limited mobility can often do water exercises or do yoga or other exercises while seated in a chair (some \"chair exercise\" videos are now on the market). of course if you have any medical condition check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. if you have questions about your condition or are still not sure what exercise you can safely do please consult your physician. meet with your doctor and discuss if it's safe for you to exercise. once you've received your doctor's ok search the internet to find alternatives. if your concerns about exercise are related to a chronic illness two good places to start would be with a support group or just looking up if their are any national associations that might have some information they could share. (examples: arthritis foundation the national multiple sclerosis society). also ask your physician and contact your local hospital to see if there are any medically monitored programs in your community. many of these are covered by insurance and provide enrollees with both exercise and education about their condition. numerous people routinely enroll in cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation programs around the country and are astounded with the benefits they get out of these programs. finally since your on webmd check out our article base by doing a search on exercise as there are numerous articles on exercising with a chronic disease."

    "Question": "i'm in my late 50's and have implants. my right breast hurts when touched in one spot. should i be worried? . i have not had any injuries to my breast.",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it can't hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure. while it's likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else. and that's why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain. as you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue. as time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to \"pulling\" on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself. and of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer. any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts. if you can't see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider. he or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i'm really surprised the doctor did not give you any options at that point. especially if it's causing you pain call the urologist every day a couple times each day seeing if they can get you in sooner or if there are any cancellations. if not find another urologist that can help you now. part of being a parent is asking all the questions like these to the doctor you are seeing. it's not a good thing for a patient to leave with more questions than they went in with having - time to find another doctor. always do the best you can to be prepared for doctors' visits with any questions or concerns you have; medications for any conditions you have that you do and do not feel comfortable taking; etc. don't let them pass you around - in cases like this they can always squeeze you in somewhere. make sure you are clear to the urologist's office when you call that you are in extreme pain and need to be seen that day; and if they can't help you you'll pay another doctor who can get you in sooner (after all you are paying for their service). wish you lots of luck. take care."

    "Question": "how does fibromyalgia affect sex and intimacy and how can we address these problems?",
    "Answer": "fibromyalgia and its chronic pain can affect sex and intimacy. fm affects everything else so why shouldn't it cause unique problems with sex and intimacy as well? fm introduces new fears concerns and anxieties into a relationship and we must understand them and address them. first understanding the unique problems fm causes with sex: 1. pain. the physiological equivalent of a cold shower! we hurt all over and any pressure or weight or squeezing aggravates the pain. sex is not supposed to hurt. 2. fatigue. no energy = less sexually active. mental fatigue = decreased motivation = loss of libido = less sexually active. the person with fm may go to bed several hours before the partner and be asleep by the time the partner gets into bed. it is difficult to have successful sexual intimacy when one person is asleep! since sleep is so valuable and so short-lived for many with fibro any deep sleep will be more desired than sex esp[ecially] at 11:30 pm! 3. associated conditions. ibs can cause nausea abdominal pains and more bowel alertness than sexual alertness. depression can cause additional loss of libido interest and motivation. anxiety can interfere with sexual responses. poor self esteem can lead to lack of interest or embarrassment. 4. medicine side effects. ssris can decrease libido or cause sexual dysfunctions including ed [erectile dysfunction] in men. muscle relaxers tricyclics and antiseizure meds can cause extreme sedation. different meds can cause nausea or gi [gastrointestinal] symptoms and shift the focus from the bedroom to the bathroom. so with so much \"negative stuff\" going on with fibro how do we possibly figure out a way to enjoy sex? we focus on the positives of sex rather than the problems. we reassure ourselves that intimacy is good for you your relationship and your fibro. sex can be therapeutic. let's count the ways. 1. it is a physical activity. isn't physical activity good for fibro? ! 2. it increases our body's endorphins. 3. it improves blood flow removes toxins from cells and boosts our immune system. 4. it results in stretching and then relaxation of our muscles. 5. it reduces stress. 6. it re-connects us emotionally and intimately. 7. usually we forget about pain during sexual intimacy! we should reassure ourselves that we are not hurting ourselves by being intimate; rather we are helping both the fibro and the relationship. your partner is also dealing with fears and anxieties about hurting you so you both need to be reassured about the positive aspects of being intimate."

    "Answer": "one of the questions or at least problems that some people tell me dr. breus i take a nap and i feel worse when i get up than i did when i fell asleep. well that means that you’ve napped too long because then you’ve gone into deep sleep and you’re going to have a real hard time pulling yourself out of that deep sleep. now is it just because you woke up in the middle of that deep sleep? generally speaking if you wake up in the middle of that deep sleep it’s really hard to shake that sleepy feeling and that’s when you don’t feel so good. what can you do if that does happen to you? truthfully there’s not a whole lot. you could have some caffeine which would help bring you out of it. caffeine by the way i don’t have a problem with caffeine i don’t have a problem with people drinking coffee i just want them to do it responsibly and know and understand the effects of caffeine. so if you wake up from a nap and you feel worse than you did before having some caffeine will probably help. the biggest thing that’s going to help though is walking outside and getting sunlight. sunlight is it directly affects your body’s ability to produce melatonin. because remember you don’t produce melatonin in the light. so if you wake up and you don’t feel so hot before you go and grab that soda or coffee i’d say walk outside and get a little bit of sunlight and even walk around a little bit and you should be able shake yourself out of it pretty quick."

    "Question": "any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i'm too tired to cook after work?",
    "Answer": "you are definitely not alone. however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day. for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite. if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to (and not calories) like rotisserie chicken. just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro. pick out veggies at the salad bar — they are already washed chopped and prepped for you. you can take them home and roast them in a 450 degree f oven for 5-7 minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. this is a great and easy veggie side dish that wouldn’t take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils. sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating. for instance tonight i got home after 12 hours of traveling and i’m battling over what i could make for dinner — or — to pick up thai food. i think that thai is going to win tonight. but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order. i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk. while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra 1000 calories that can come from some of the richer choices won’t be worth it. what will be a much better choice will still be delicious. spring rolls that are fresh — not fried — and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice. another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil (ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants). also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice. i’m reminding myself of this as i am you. when i’m tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice. another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out. many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices."

    "Answer": "abnormal bleeding in late pregnancy may be more serious because it can signal a problem with the mother or baby. call your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any bleeding in your second or third trimester. possible causes of bleeding in late pregnancy include: placenta previa. this condition occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the opening of the birth canal. although placenta previa is very rare occurring in only one in 200 pregnancies it is an emergency requiring immediate medical attention. bleeding from placenta previa can often occur without any pain. placental abruption. in about 1% of pregnancies the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during labor and blood pools between the placenta and uterus. placental abruption can be very dangerous to both the mother and baby. other symptoms of placental abruption are abdominal pain clots from the vagina tender uterus and back pain. uterine rupture. in rare cases a scar from a previous c-section can tear open during pregnancy. uterine rupture can be life-threatening and requires an emergency c-section. other symptoms of uterine rupture are pain and tenderness in the abdomen. vasa previa. in this very rare condition the developing baby's blood vessels in the umbilical cord or placenta cross the opening to the birth canal. vasa previa can be very dangerous to the baby because the blood vessels can tear open causing the baby to bleed severely and lose oxygen. other symptoms of vasa previa include abnormal fetal heart rate and excessive bleeding. premature labor. vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy may just be a sign that your body is getting ready to deliver. a few days or weeks before labor begins the mucus plug that covers the opening of the uterus will pass out of the vagina and it will usually have small amounts of blood in it (this is known as \"bloody show\"). if bleeding and symptoms of labor begin before the 37th week of pregnancy contact your doctor right away because you might be in preterm labor. other symptoms of preterm labor include contractions vaginal discharge abdominal pressure and ache in the lower back. additional causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are: injury to the cervix or vagina polyps cancer."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your daughter went through this. i hope she has been successfully treated for her anorexia and bulimia. the symptoms you describe could be caused by many things and only a health care professional can tell for sure what caused this episode. however if indeed this was an isolated incident one likely cause of these symptoms is low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ). if a person doesn't eat regularly or if they work too hard and neglect their health overall their blood sugar can drop and cause precisely the symptoms you describe. in a case like that giving sugar is the best remedy. crackers would do the trick because the carbohydrates would quickly be converted to simple sugars. if the crackers and water made your daughter feel better chances are good this was just an episode of hypoglycemia. your daughter can avoid future episodes by taking care of herself including eating quality foods on a regular schedule drinking plenty of water and exercising. with her history of anorexia and bulimia it's important she maintains healthy non-compulsive eating and exercise habits. if she needs help with this she should see a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. often these services are available on a sliding fee scale. i want to emphasize i'm only speculating about one possible cause for your daughter's episode. getting to the root cause of what happened requires a physical exam and some blood testing. your daughter needs to find a way to obtain medical care not only because of what happened with the fainting but to help manage her health eating disorders anxiety and tobacco use. wishing you all well!"

    "Answer": "a small amount of blood after intercourse would not be uncommon. usually this is due to small tears in the sensitive lining or opening of the vagina but it could also be from your bf. it the bleeding persists you will need to see a medical professional to search for the reason."

    "Question": "my doctor has put me on dicyclomine 20 mg four-times-a-day for two weeks. it makes me sleepy. will i get used to this?",
    "Answer": "this is actually a side-effect of the medication working and drowsiness will actually continue as long as you are taking the medicine it will not subside. so i would advise the patient to let the physician know if it becomes really bothersome they feel that they can't go to work. there is actually a lower shrunk of this medication that is available. so the physician or healthcare provider may want to consider decreasing the dose and basically seeing if that helps the patient better with the drowsiness side-effect. but once again if the patient comes into the pharmacy and says to me you know i feel like i am really tired of this medication and i have to take it a lot of time four-times-a-day is really complicated for a medication. i might be able to say you know let's call your doctor and let's see if we can get them down to a lower dose and if the doctor approves it then we can try that instead. but coming to the pharmacy asking us that's what we are here for. we are the medication experts."

    "Question": "what causes a low white blood cell count?",
    "Answer": "white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. as they mature white blood cells are continually released into the bloodstream. white blood cells circulate throughout the body ready to fight infections. they live about two or three weeks when they are broken down and recycled by the body. a normal white blood cell count is between about 4 500 and 10 000 cells per microliter. many conditions can cause a low white blood cell count: • infection (which usually increases the white blood cell count but may decrease it). • drugs especially chemotherapy. • human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). • severe alcohol abuse. • radiation therapy. • cancer affecting the bone marrow. • connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). many african-americans have a naturally lower white blood cell count. this is caused by a gene mutation that may have evolved as a defense against malaria. most often a low white blood cell count is temporary and improves on its own."

    "Question": "is sex during pregnancy safe?",
    "Answer": "sex is a natural normal part of pregnancy -- if you're having a normal pregnancy. the movement and penetration of intercourse in itself won't harm the baby. your baby is protected by your abdomen and the muscular walls of the uterus. your baby is also cushioned by the fluid in the amniotic sac. as a general safety precaution some doctors advise avoiding sex in the last few weeks of pregnancy believing that hormones in semen called prostaglandins can stimulate contractions. one exception? women who are overdue and want to induce labor. some doctors believe that prostaglandins in semen actually induce labor in a full-term or past-due pregnancy since the gel used to \"ripen\" the cervix and induce labor also contains prostaglandins. if you have a high-risk pregnancy -- for instance with a complication such as preterm labor or risk of miscarriage -- your doctor may advise you to avoid sex during pregnancy."

    "Question": "what's the relationship between bmi and body fat?",
    "Answer": "bmi is a tool that estimates body fat based on height and weight measures of individuals. as bmi increases so does your risk for heart disease high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. but this tool is not perfect. it can overestimate body fat in individuals who are very lean but weigh more like athletes and it can underestimate body fat in people who are thin but have low muscle tone. bmi is calculated from your height and weight and is used as an indirect screening tool for body fat and risk of diseases or other health conditions. bmi does have its limitations however as some individuals such as athletes may have a high bmi because of increased muscle mass. as a result they might have a high bmi but not a high percentage of body fat. there are other more direct measurement techniques for body fat percentage; some of which include: • underwater weighing • air displacement • dual energy x-ray • bioelectrical impedance • skinfold measurements there are however trade-offs with each method. the more accurate methods tend to require specialized equipment that can be very expensive and require additional training and take longer to implement. the quicker and cheaper methods may not require much additional training but may not be as accurate. researchers have to choose which method will best fit their needs. let's just keep it simple. if your waist is above 45% of your height you are too fat and if you work on just that number you will become lean and healthy. for example a man who is 72\" tall (6') need to keep his waist under 32\" and a woman who is 68\" tall (5\"8\") needs to keep her waist under 30\". just measure your height in inches and multiply times. 45. another easy way is if your pants waist is not smaller than your pants length it is time to eat less and exercise more. mike at everyouncecounts@gmail. com"

    "Answer": "this is a really good question. there is a lot that we don’t really know about rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and multiple sclerosis (ms). both ms and ra are considered to be autoimmune diseases. this means that for some reason the body’s own immune system attacks parts of itself. in ra the immune system begins to attack the joints. in ms it attacks the brain and spinal cord. why this happens in some people is not entirely clear. certain autoimmune diseases and the tendency to get autoimmune diseases does seem to run in families. it is thought that different things can trigger ms and ra. these triggers may be hormonal genetic or environmental. exposure to certain viruses is thought to be a trigger. epstein-barr virus (ebv) has suspected links to both ra and ms. there are also other connections. some studies suggest that ms patients may be more likely to get ra and other autoimmune diseases. and a treatment for ra called anti-tnf therapy can cause a condition very similar to ms. i hope this helps. as you can see we all still have a lot to learn about ms ra and all the other autoimmune diseases."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you got burned by mortar mix. i'll bet that was unpleasant! to answer your question. burns no matter the cause are categorized by the degree of tissue damage. here's a rundown: first-degree burn: dry appearance; red; painful; like a superficial sunburn second-degree burn: moist appearance; often blistered or oozing; often red but may be white in appearance; may be extremely painful or you may have reduced sensation in the burned area third-degree burn: severe burn that destroys all layers of the skin leading to a dry black or white appearance; not painful this is a very general overview of burn classifications. the tricky part comes with second-degree burns which can be partial- or full-thickness. if you get a severe burn that appears dry and you have a reduced sensation in the area (full-thickness second-degree burn) you should seek medical attention. you describe your chemical burn as \"minor. \" if that's the case the burned skin should peel off over the course of about a week and the pain should clear up. if your mild burn has not cleared up within a week or if it appears to be getting worse instead of better then you should seek medical attention. it's possible the burn was more serious than you thought. also a minor burn should not cause any nerve damage because it only affects the topmost layer of skin. again if you feel a burn has caused nerve damage it's worth getting it looked at by a medical professional. feel better soon!"

    "Question": "my step dad has perscription for both ondansetron odt and oxycodone. what kind of illness prompts the use of \"odt\"? . my step dad has gone to the hospital twice in a row now. my mom assures me there is not a problem but i am worried that she may be avoiding a more serious health issue. . i know that the \"odt\" medication is used for the effects of chemo but my step dad has never had cancer. he is however a disabled veteran. and while he is still constantly upbeat and healthy he did have a surgery but that was about last year in 2012. . are there any specific cases in which a doctor might prescribe both?",
    "Answer": "oxycodone of course is a potent narcotic pain medication. his doctor must feel that he needs this level of pain control ondansetron is used to control nausea and vomiting only. the\"odt\" just means oral disintegrating tablet (melts in your mouth). oxycodone can cause nausea but i have no idea if this is the reason his doctor prescribed it."

    "Question": "what is circumcision like in teen years? . we've recently decided to get my 12-year-old brother circumcised because it was irritating him a lot. i was wondering what the risks would be recovery time and how painful it'll be for him?",
    "Answer": "remember that most of the men on this planet are not circumsized but rather just the way that nature made them. the male foreskin is just a skin covering not unlike the lips or eyelids. it does not need to be removed and whatever is causing the irritation can likely be fixed. circumcision at age 12: not likely covered by insurance; this would be considered a cosmetic procedure done under anesthesia may be general or local will be painful for several weeks following surgery risk of infection and other post-surgical complications hi don't if he has some kind of irritation is this from him not washing behind his foreskin if its to tight get him to play with his foreskin he needs to start stretching it sideways and length ways and slowly he will be able to get his foreskin back then using a seas salt water wash this will help clean and get rid of any irritations behind it. it would be far better for his later sex life if he is left intact than having a circumcision. do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Question": "what are standard treatments for hives?",
    "Answer": "the first step in controlling hives is to identify the cause if possible. once you have identified the source of the problem try to avoid exposure to it in the future. a mild case of hives often disappears on its own after a few hours. a longer-lasting case should respond to the manufacturer's recommended dosage of an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. if your hives don't disappear in a few days see a doctor. if you develop symptoms of angioedema or anaphylaxis get medical help immediately. for chronic or especially troublesome outbreaks of hives your doctor will probably order a course of prescription antihistamines. treatment with oral corticosteroids will sometimes reduce swelling when antihistamines don't work but they are usually reserved for more severe cases. if you have the subsurface welts of angioedema you may require hospitalization."

    "Answer": "influenza (also known as the flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. it can cause mild to severe illness and at times can lead to death. the flu is different from a cold. the flu usually comes on suddenly. people who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: • fever* or feeling feverish/chills • cough • sore throat • runny or stuffy nose • muscle or body aches • headaches • fatigue (tiredness) • some people may have vomiting and diarrhea though this is more common in children than adults. * it's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. most people who get influenza will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people will develop complications (such as an ear infection) as a result of the flu. pneumonia bronchitis sinus and ear infections are examples of complications from flu."

    "Question": "why is it important to drink plenty of fluids during a cold.",
    "Answer": "that's a great question! bravo to you for taking a moment to question the conventional wisdom. there are actually a few reasons why we exhort people to drink plenty of fluids when they come down with a cold. let's take a look at these. first drinking plenty of fluids literally can increase your blood volume and thereby scatter the virus molecules in your system so your own immune system can fight it better. think of it this way: which is the easier enemy to attack the one with 500 soldiers concentrated together or the one with bands of 10 soldiers dispersed here and there? drinking fluid can spread out the virus in your bloodstream so it's easier to attack. honestly though drinking fluids by mouth can only do so much in this regard. intravenous fluids (iv) work much better for this purpose. second drinking plenty of fluids tends to thin secretions -- i. e. : that nasty gunk that pours from your nose and gets coughed up out of your lungs. thinner secretions are easier for the body to move than thick sticky ones. thick sticky fluids can get stuck in the lower portions of the lungs and lead to pneumonia if your body can't cough them up. in this respect drinking fluids by mouth truly can make a difference in helping your body clear out mucus. finally good hydration helps medication work better. if you take any sort of over-the-counter cough and cold product (or if you are taking a prescription such as antibiotics) it requires liquid (water is best) to dissolve well in your stomach and get absorbed in the intestines. drinking plenty of water also helps your body circulate the active ingredients in those medications more easily so they work better. frankly drinking plenty of water and being well-hydrated when you have a cold simply can make you feel better. water should always be your first choice but chicken soup can't hurt either. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i believe when a person reaches an advanced age such as age 80 or older that he or she should have a discussion with his or her primary care provider about what screening tests still are necessary to undergo. (a related question for you: is a mammogram necessary at age 86? ) the answer to your question lies in many individualized factors such as how healthy and robust the 86 year old woman in question is. if she's very healthy and active and wishes to remain so then she may choose to undergo a colonoscopy test. if she's frail and has many other health problems then she may choose not to undergo colonoscopy. the purpose of colonoscopy is to detect precancerous polyps at an early stage in order to remove them. colonoscopy is recommended once every 10 years for people at an \"average risk\" for colon cancer. ultimately if the 86 year old woman in question is of sound mind she is entitled to make her own informed decision about whether or not to have a colonoscopy at her age. a medical professional should provide her with an unbiased assessment of the risks and benefits of such a test. the rigors and possible side effects of the colonoscopy prep should be discussed. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what tests are common during the third trimester of pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "these tests are common in the third trimester of pregnancy: group b streptococcus screening : vaginal and rectal swabs are taken at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy to detect group b strep bacteria. although group b strep can be present in up to 30% of all healthy women it's the leading cause of life-threatening infections in newborns and can also cause mental retardation impaired vision and hearing loss. women who test positive are treated with antibiotics during delivery to protect the baby from contracting the infection at birth. as an alternative your physician or midwife may choose not to test for strep but to treat you in labor if certain risk factors develop. electronic fetal heart monitoring : electronic fetal heart monitoring is done during pregnancy labor and delivery to monitor the heart rate of the fetus. the fetal heart rate can indicate whether the fetus is doing well or is in trouble and can be done any time after 20 weeks. nonstress test : done weekly in many high-risk pregnancies such as women with twins diabetes or high blood pressure this test involves using a fetal monitor strapped across the mother's abdomen to measure the baby's heart rate as it moves. it's also used for monitoring overdue babies. contraction stress test : also done in high-risk pregnancies a fetal monitor measures the baby's heart rate in response to contractions stimulated either by oxytocin (pitocin) or nipple stimulation. doctors use the measurements to predict how well the baby will cope with the stress of labor. biophysical profile : combines a nonstress test with an ultrasound for a more accurate evaluation of the baby."

    "Answer": "there aren't any specific medical tests that can detect depression. health care professionals determine if a teen has depression by conducting interviews and psychological tests with the teen and his or her family members teachers and peers. the severity of the teen depression and the risk of suicide are determined based on the assessment of these interviews. treatment recommendations are also made based on the data collected from the interviews. the doctor will also look for signs of potentially co-existing psychiatric disorders such as anxiety mania or schizophrenia. the doctor will also assess the teen for risks of suicidal or homicidal behaviors. incidences of attempted suicide and self-mutilation is higher in females than males while completed suicide is higher in males. one of most vulnerable groups for completed suicide is the 18-24 age group."

    "Answer": "the reason is is that prevacid has recently been approved to go over-the-counter. so that's probably one of the reasons why the insurance is not covering it anymore. however though it all depends on the person's insurance. insurances have list of medications that they will pay for called formularies and it's not uncommon for drugs to go on formulary and off of formulary. so as a pharmacist when i get a prescription and i process it through the insurance they usually tell me this type of information. so if you are unsure you can ask us. but once again if you look at the back of your insurance card there is 1-800 member services number. that's for you to call with questions about what's covered what's not what is my copay at a particular location? feel free to call them and ask them exactly why prevacid is no longer covered under your insurance."

    "Answer": "there is a risk of contracting a sexually-transmitted disease through unprotected oral sex. herpes chlamydia gonorrhea syphilis hiv hepatitis and a few others are possible. ejaculation is not required to acquire an std. just a penis without a condom is all that it takes. i have no way of calculating your risk but if your oral partner has been with a lot of guys you sort of just had sex with all of them. i am glad that her teeth and lips were fine but you need to do more than just a dental exam. you need to be more selective with your partners and practice safer sex. that way you will not have to worry. the bottom line: you may have been exposed to an std. if you are having any signs or symptoms of any of these stds (you need to do some homework) then you will need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined and tested. condoms are so much more inexpensive than medical visits diagnostic tests and sleepless nights filled with worry. they are inexpensive readily available and they fit in your wallet. use 'em next time and from now on. can you get c diff from having oral sex with your partner who has decayed teeth?"

    "Question": "how can i find the best surgeon for my procedure?",
    "Answer": "the selection of a surgeon is really a complicated and somewhat daunting process today for many reasons. first of all medicine is becoming more and more specialized. there are more and more subdivisions within given specialties and within those subdivisions there even further subdivisions so you have to not only be in the right church you have to be in the right pew. you want to be in the right place. compounding it is the fact that there’s a little bit of blurring of specialty lines. one is not prohibited by law from migrating from one’s specialty into one of the 4 cosmetic surgery specialties. basically there are 4 recognized specialties that perform cosmetic surgery plastic surgery which is cosmetic surgery all over the body; head and neck surgeons who perform the cosmetic surgery only of the face and neck; dermatologists who perform skin peeling and other and liposuction and again procedures on the skin and then ophthalmologists these are eye specialists who further specialize just in the reconstructive and cosmetic surgery of the eyelids. so you have a lot of different participants in the delivery system and the question is how do you pick which one and that’s where you’ve got to do some homework. not every ophthalmologist for example has had additional training to be an excellent eyelid cosmetic surgeon and not every dermatologist has had the additional training or experience to be a world class chemical skin peeler to remove wrinkles. not every plastic surgeon is good at both breast augmentation and nose jobs which are operations in two different arenas. so you’ve got to be armed with questions so that you can ferret out who really is most appropriate and the answer comes with how specialized are you doctor? now in the world of cosmetic surgery if you have a choice between a plastic surgeon an ophthalmologist a dermatologist or a head and neck surgeon you need to find out what each of those doctors majors in. for example head and neck surgeon may major in nose jobs and do more nose jobs than say face lifts or eyelid surgery. on the other hand across the street is an ophthalmologist that does eyelid surgery exclusively. so if you needed to have an eyelid surgery example you’d be very well served by going to that eye surgeon who only does eyelids. maybe by some of the other doctors but you’d feel more comfortable being in the hands of the most specialized. so how do you ascertain that? you ask the doctor’s training and then you ask what i think is probably the key question that most people don’t ask. did you have a fellowship in cosmetic surgery? fellowships are the finishing school of the world of cosmetic surgery and by the way fellowships exist in other specialties. the fellowship is the practical training in a very narrow sphere of cosmetic surgery because cosmetic surgery is really a well defined world unto itself. it’s a limited number of procedures. it’s everything from face lifts and forehead lifts all the way to tummy tucks and breast surgery and necks in between. so my advice is to find the doctor that has trained the longest and strongest meaning that additional training and that’s voluntary and strong meaning they are very focused on what they do. the best most accomplished most talented surgeons the ones that you and i would like to go to typically are the ones that are the most specialized."

    "Answer": "you cannot assume that the provider networks of any two plans are the same. if you have a doctor and/or hospital that you want to continue seeing you must confirm that the providers are included in each plan's network. you may be able to check through the marketplace but always double and triple check by also contacting the plan directly and then your doctor's office. but if you're offered insurance at work you likely won't qualify for a subsidy unless the premium costs you more than 9. 5% of your annual income. your best bet is likely to stick with your employer's plan."

    "Answer": "yes. every woman ovulates at different times in her menstrual cycle. plus embryos implant in the uterus at different times. so most home pregnancy tests suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week. sometimes women get false negative results (when the test says you are not pregnant and you are) when they test too early in the pregnancy. other times problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hcg in the urine. if your hpt is negative test yourself again in a few days or one week. if you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant talk with your doctor right away."

    "Question": "can you take pills for yeast infection while on antidepressants? . i am taking 10mg escitalopram and 150mg bupropion daily for treatment of depression and have just taken a one-time dose of 150 mg fluconazole (5 hours after the other two medications) for treatment of yeast infection. should i be concerned about drug interactions between these? what would be the signs and symptoms if there was a problem? and will they go away on their own since the fluconazole is just one dose or do i need to see a doctor?",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer whenever you take several medications it is important to check with your doctor and pharmacist about drug interactions. you are wise to question the combination of bupropion (wellbutrin) escitalopram (lexapro) and fluconazole (diflucan). bupropion increases your risk of seizures and the addition of escitalopram (lexapro) raises that risk further. this is especially worrisome for the elderly and for those who are at risk for seizures for example from a head injury. presumably the doctor who prescribed both of these medications felt that the benefit of this combination outweighed the risk. sometimes your doctor will need to check your blood levels of escitalopram when bupropion and escitalopram are used together. adding a single dose of fluconazole a fungal medication taken by mouth probably won’t have a significant effect on how you feel. however when fluconazole is used for several days it can raise the blood levels of escitalopram increasing your risk of complications. there are several web sites that allow you to check drug interactions online but the safest path is to check with your doctor. when you are seeing several doctors who are prescribing medications there is a risk that drug interactions between medications will be overlooked. to safeguard against this happening it is always best to have one doctor a family practitioner or internist overseeing all your care. checking with your pharmacist before filling medications is also important."

    "Answer": "well unless you live in one of the states that permits the use of medical marijuana (and you have a valid prescription for it) then the law says you shouldn't be using it at all. but let's assume you do have a medical marijuana prescription. in general i wouldn't think smoking cannabis would interfere with the action of prednisone. prednisone is a steroid preparation that treats inflammatory conditions. i must add however that few studies have been done to evaluate potential drug interactions with marijuana. so the real answer to your question is: we just don't know if using marijuana while taking prednisone is harmful or not. hope that helps!"

    "Question": "what causes hair loss?",
    "Answer": "doctors do not know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. although a person's level of androgens -- male hormones normally produced by both men and women -- is believed to be a factor hair loss has nothing to do with virility. an individual's genes however -- from both male and female parents -- unquestionably influence that person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss that can occur within a few months after a high fever a severe illness or extreme stress and in women following childbirth. drugs that can cause temporary hair loss include chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment blood thinners retinoids used to treat acne and other skin problems beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure and birth control pills. hair loss can also be caused by burns x-rays and scalp injuries. in such cases normal hair growth usually returns once the cause is eliminated. ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. the causes of alopecia areata a disease that often strikes children or teenagers remain unexplained. it is thought to be an autoimmune disease meaning that the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. in most cases the hair grows back although it may be very fine and possibly a different color before normal coloration and thickness return. although shampooing too often perms bleaching and dyeing hair do not cause baldness they can contribute to overall thinning by making hair weak and brittle. tight braiding and using rollers or hot curlers can damage and break hair and running hair picks through tight curls can scar hair follicles. in most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed but severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches."

    "Answer": "i don't know what she is taking but there is a very common amoxicillin side effect that can produce a rash near the end of the antibiotic course of treatment. scarlet fever tends to be a generalized (all over the body) bright red sandpapery/rough skin rash that will eventually peel (especially on the palms and feet). a person would not typically get a scarlet fever eruption on day six using an antibiotic that could treat strep (again i don't know what she is taking). was your daughter lab-diagnosed with strep (rapid strep swab or a strep culture? ) or was it a clinical diagnosis (the medical provider just examined her throat and said \"strep\"). clinical diagnoses of strep are no more accurate than a coin-toss in most instances."

    "Question": "how do symptoms of celiac disease differ with age of onset?",
    "Answer": "in the past celiac disease was considered to be a disease primarily of infants and children. it is now clear that initial signs and symptoms of celiac disease can occur in adults and even in the elderly. symptoms in infants infants with celiac disease typically have diarrhea steatorrhea abdominal cramps abdominal distension irritability muscle wasting and failure to thrive and grow. these symptoms typically occur after the introduction of gluten-containing cereals into their diets. symptoms in children children with celiac disease typically have diarrhea increased amounts of fat in the stool (steatorrhea) flatulence (passing gas) short stature and weight loss. proper treatment with a gluten-free diet can lead to accelerated (catch-up) growth in height; however if untreated childhood celiac disease can result in short stature as an adult. as children with celiac disease enter adolescence many will experience spontaneous remissions (reduced symptoms) and remain free of the signs and symptoms of celiac disease until later in adulthood. this later reactivation can be precipitated by stress such as pregnancy or surgery. symptoms in adults adults with celiac disease may have symptoms of diarrhea steatorrhea weight loss and flatulence; however many adults do not have diarrhea or steatorrhea. they have either no symptoms or only vague abdominal discomfort such as bloating abdominal distension and excess gas. they also may have only one or a few signs of malnutrition such as iron deficiency anemia abnormal bleeding or bone fractures. some individuals with celiac disease and gastrointestinal symptoms are mistakenly diagnosed to have irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). there have been changes during the past 20 years in the way in which celiac disease is diagnosed. the average age at which celiac disease is diagnosed has increased probably because of the increased awareness that the disease can first cause symptoms or signs in adults. whereas in the past diarrhea was the initial symptom in 80% of patients it now is the initial symptom in only 40%. a small proportion of patients - about 15% - are now diagnosed with blood antibody tests because they have a close relative with celiac disease and they are being screened to see if they also have the disease."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry your husband is going through this and it's good of you to help him with it. several conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so it wouldn't hurt to see a medical professional for an opinion. assuming the cause is benign (that is not life-threatening) however your husband (or you) might consider keeping a diary of what he eats every day and how it affects his stomach issues. if this is a food intolerance or allergy it might come to light through a diary. your husband also could try going on a \"bland diet\" to see if that helps his problem. in a bland diet foods generally are cooked free of fiber and excessive fat and not spicy. examples are white rice chicken and broth. if you begin with this type of diet you can then add foods one at a time to see if any one of them triggers an adverse reaction in your husband. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "it would be highly unlikely for any surgeon (or an insurance company that would pay for this elective procedure) to agree that a hysterectomy is the way to go at this point. it is not just your age that is a contributing factor but a hysterectomy is not medically-indicated in most cases just because you have two kids and your periods are heavy/painful. see your gynecologist and i am sure there are other solutions to answer your concerns that are considerably less riskier than removing your uterus. thank you for asking with the age of just 18 i am afraid going for hysterectomy is unwise although possible. procedures like hysterectomy are permanent and there is no coming back and depression and other psychological accidents are common in such women as well. also there is a long life ahead for you you may wanna change your mind to have another child due to any reason and then you will need a uterus to conceive. so my suggestion is don't opt for it unless you have some severe problem with uterus like heavy periods etc. hysterectomy can wait till 35 years or older age. i hope it helps. regards dr s khan ehealthdesk"

    "Answer": "on average it takes a normal couple one year to get pregnant. have intercourse every other day not every day (every day reduces sperm counts). and if you want to be more accurate use ovulation test strips. you are most fertile 3 days before you ovulate to 1 day after ovulation. answer test strips are my favorite because they offer 20 strips a month for you to test on (great if you have irregular cycles). the second line on the strip will often be darker than the control line when you do ovulate. keep track of your cycles on a calendar so you know approximately when you ovulate so you can target the days you try to conceive better. if it goes past a year or if your monthly cycles are over 35 days (from the first day of your period to your next first day) you can go to the doctor and get checked out but chances are you just need a little more time! good luck!"

    "Answer": "without using health insurance to cover the cost of diagnostic tests your only option is to pay for the services directly. but i'm not sure why there would be a concern. one of the most important changes the affordable care act makes is to no longer allow insurance companies to deny anyone coverage or charge them more because of a pre-existing medical condition. prior to the law a diagnosis on one's record could make it difficult or in some cases impossible to obtain health insurance outside of a work setting. but starting january 1 2014 that's no longer the case. you might want to explain this to your parents so that you can get the help you need and insurance coverage to help pay for it."

    "Question": "could it be unsafe to have multiple procedures?",
    "Answer": "the issue of is it safe to have multiple procedures because they add up in length. and that does have to be taken into consideration. you do have to take into consideration the length of the operation but more importantly the nature of the operation. the reason is that liposuction for example and what we call large volume liposuction has had some percentage of significant complications due to the nature of the procedure where there is just a lot of fluid being sucked out of the body and a lot of fluid being put in for the anesthesia and frankly it’s a little less scientific than we’d like it to be and for that reason the time element of the operation comes into play the volume comes in in other words that’s a major operation and if you tack that on at the end of 5 hours previously with a face lift let’s say it’s probably not always a very good idea. so again this is where common sense comes in and this is where the surgeon has to say you know you need a lot of this and maybe here’s where we do have to split it up into two trips to the operating room. so all these factors have to come into play the length of the operation and the nature of the operation and the patients own particular let’s say underlying their physiology how they are known to heal. if somebody says well i’m really a slow healer again you become a little more conservative."

    "Answer": "it sounds like you're saying your friend was removed from life support and if so i'm very sorry for your loss. i'm sure the family did not make the decision to remove the ventilator without a lot of input from the doctors caring for your friend. a family cannot unilaterally decide to withdraw life support. ultimately that decision is made mutually between the care team and the loved ones. regarding pain: you may not be able to \"feel\" pain if you're unconscious but pain causes a physical reaction in the body. this is one way we can tell if an unconscious patient is experiencing pain. as you noted high blood pressure and agitation can be symptoms of pain. i encountered this frequently as a recovery room nurse when my patients were still asleep after surgery but obviously were experiencing a pain response. to set your mind at ease about the withdrawal of life support let me just say some brain injuries cannot be overcome. brain tissue cannot repair itself the way most other body tissues can. for example you get a cut on your finger and eventually skin cells fill in the gap. it doesn't work like that in the brain (or the heart for that matter). when brain cells die they are dead forever. if your friend's doctors felt he was \"brain dead \" it means he never would have recovered no matter how much time he was given. again i'm sorry for your loss."

    "Question": "at 55 i have nasolabial creases worse than friends 10 years older. what are the least invasive lowest-risk options?",
    "Answer": "there are excellent nonsurgical treatments available. radiofrequency treatments such as thermage can help tighten the skin and give a little lift soft tissue fillers and volumizers such as radiesse and sculptra placed in the correct areas of the cheeks along the jaw line and nasolabial folds can rejuvenate tighten and lift very nicely and the results can last 2-4 years with touch ups intermittently after that to maintain and enhance the results. if you are set on a facelift i would recommend seeing a board-certified plastic surgeon to have all your options explained in detail."

    "Answer": "only your body can cause an allergic reaction. your body is reacting to something it views as a threat or invader. a bite can't cause an allergy but it can cause your body to have a reaction. the prior bite is probably unrelated to your symptoms. especially since it happened 3 months ago and you're still having issues. keep in mind that you can develop an allergy at any point. example: perhaps you drink orange juice every day. 3 times a day. you can even develope an allergy in the same day. imagine drinking the first and second glass of oj and be just fine. then you could drink the third glass and have a reaction. because of your eye symptoms it makes me think it's more likely you're allergic to something in the air. i'm sure you've heard of hayfever. however latex allergies can be very dangerous. let's say you have a severe reaction and need to go to the emergency room. guess what? the dr's. and nurses will be touching you with latex gloves! (which would make it worse! ) you need to be tested to find out your allergen. (what it is that's causing your body\"s reaction. ) you can have your doctor test you or even use one of the home allergy tests they have on the market now."

    "Answer": "you would just have to ask the rn for her rationale. many people reject vaccines for a variety of reasons -- some valid and some ridiculous. if these are her children then she has the right not to vaccinate or decide which vaccinations her children receive. the flu vaccine is optional as far as schools are concerned but not optional in my book. i am very pro-vaccine but i do allow the parents the right to refuse. they do have to hear my lecture however but in the end the decision is theirs. as a grandmother -- and i am a grandparent too -- we have memories of those days before vaccinations. some new parents have never seen the diseases that ravaged our generation. did she give you any specific reason? if it's a time issue maybe you can volunteer to take your grandchildren to a nearby pharmacy or health department to get the shots. or is she worried about its safety? would it help to give her some stats from the cdc on vaccine safety and flu? here's something that may help. <link> there are myths that persist about flu shots. my mother refuses to get one because she thinks it will give her the flu and no amount of discussion from me will convince her otherwise. remember that kids especially those under 5 are more susceptible to the flu. so it's great that you are trying to talk to her about this. remember that ultimately it's her decision as the parent and good luck with your presuasion skills!"

    "Question": "the dermatologist says if i go out in the sun after having ipl treatments my age spots will come back. what can i do?",
    "Answer": "one thing about treating the skin is that it is an ongoing process. so it's environmental damage and sun exposure that cause these brown spots to begin with and so once we treat them if you go back and get that damage again chances are you will have new spots created. some spots that are going to come up over time just from previous exposures will still come through even if you never get sun exposure again. so having the ipl treatment did benefit you because now your skin looks more clear and it is more healthy and younger skin but you have to protect and preserve that skin in order to maintain the results. it doesn't mean you need to sit at home in a darkroom in order to maintain that result but you have to be sun smart. try to wear a hat when you can use an spf of 15 or higher even if it's a cloudy day don't be fooled by a day that doesn't feel so hot or sunny. reapply that sunscreen on a regular basis and stay in the shade when you can and that will do the best for you in order to minimize those spots from returning. also using over-the-counter products that contain ingredients like niacinamide and retinoids can help the skin cells turn over. they contain antioxidants that help keep the skin renewed and refreshed and those can help keep those spots away as well. also ingredients like sepiwhite can be very helpful in keeping your skin more even in tone."

    "Answer": "i'm hoping you meant to type \"102\" degree fever because 112 degrees would send most people into seizure and death. i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you are absolutely miserable. while i cannot diagnose you via internet i will say you are describing the classic symptoms of the flu. fever coughing weakness and general misery are the hallmarks of influenza. unfortunately at day 4 it's too late to get the antiviral flu treatment. on the plus side if this is a case of the flu the fever should go away over the next 24 hours or so. if your fever continues beyond the 4th day you should seek medical attention as soon as possible as this could be a sign of something serious going on. to your question: the maximum daily dose of ibuprofen (advil) as set by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) is 1200mg per day. you will have to check the label of your bottle to see how many milligrams of ibuprofen are contained in each gelcap you're taking. divide 1200mg by the amount in one capsule to find how many gelcaps you generally can safely take per day. you need to be careful not to take any other cough and cold preparations that also contain ibuprofen. even some branded tylenol products may contain other active ingredients like ibuprofen so read the labels carefully. meanwhile be sure to drink plenty of fluids. i hope you feel better soon. but if you don't be sure to seek medical attention."

    "Answer": "the birth control pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy so as long as you both do not ever (now or in the future) violate your monogamous agreement you can decide to give up condoms and withdrawal. if you both have had prior sexual partners and not had a prior std and are now testing negative you are probably good to go. remember that no birth control is 100% (unless it is abstinence and sterilization). the 98% or so effectiveness from birth control pills can be improved a bit by using condoms as well but that will be your mutual choice."

    "Answer": "common symptoms of crohn's disease include abdominal pain diarrhea and weight loss. less common symptoms include poor appetite fever night sweats rectal pain and rectal bleeding. the symptoms of crohn's disease are dependent on the location the extent and the severity of the inflammation. the different subtypes of crohn's disease and their symptoms are: crohn's colitis is inflammation that is confined to the colon. abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are the common symptoms. anal fistulae and peri-rectal abscesses also can occur. crohn's enteritis refers to inflammation confined to the small intestine (the first part called the jejunum or the second part called the ileum). involvement of the ileum alone is referred to as crohn's ileitis. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. obstruction of the small intestine also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis is inflammation that affects only the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum) the part of the small intestine closest to the colon. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's enterocolitis and ileocolitis are terms to describe inflammation that involve both the small intestine and the colon. bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis and ileo-colitis are the most common types of crohn's disease. (ulcerative colitis frequently involves only the rectum or rectum and sigmoid colon at the distal end of the colon. these are called ulcerative proctitis and procto-sigmoiditis respectively). up to one-third of patients with crohn's disease may have one or more of the following conditions involving the anal area: swelling of the tissue of the anal sphincter the muscle at the end of the colon that controls defecation. development of ulcers and fissures (long ulcers) within the anal sphincter. these ulcers and fissures can cause bleeding and pain with defecation. development of anal fistulae (abnormal tunnels) between the anus or rectum and the skin surrounding the anus). mucous and pus may drain from the openings of the fistulae on the skin. development of perirectal abscesses (collections of pus in the anal and rectal area). perirectal abscesses can cause fever pain and tenderness around the anus."

    "Answer": "the penis is covered by skin and skin can itch for hundreds of reasons. a common cause would include yeast (balanitis) or simple dry skin like you described. contact dermatitis (allergy) to soaps or laundry detergent is another possibility. a yeast infection would respond to an over-the-counter antifungal cream; dry skin or allergic rashes will respond favorably to hydrocortisone cream (followed by a moisturizer). some people mix them together and use both so this may be something to try. if it doesn't work see your medical provider or a dermatologist for a consultation and exam."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're dealing with this. the issue of mrsa (methicillin-resistant streptococcus aureaus) infection continues to grow as a public health concern. as you've learned it can take multiple rounds of antibiotics to treat mrsa. because only the infected spot on your nose is itching i doubt what you're experiencing is a side effect of medication. i guess my point is it's impossible to say what's causing the itching and tingling without a physical examination. if you're scheduled for follow-up with your health care provider you are probably safe to take a wait-and-see approach with this as long as you don't develop a fever or additional symptoms (increased redness/swelling/heat at the infection site feeling like you're coming down with the flu -- that sort of thing). if you don't already have a follow-up appointment scheduled i'd suggest making one. you and your doctor want to be sure that infection is well and truly gone. in the meantime be sure take precautions against spreading any possible remaining infection by washing your hands often and thoroughly; not sharing towels or clothing that may have touched the infected spot; and routinely disinfecting routinely touched surfaces by using antimicrobial wipes or something similar. i hope this helps!"

    "Question": "what is the relationship of sludge to gallstones?",
    "Answer": "sludge is a common term for an abnormality of bile seen with ultrasonography of the gallbladder. specifically the bile within the gallbladder is seen to be of two different densities with the denser bile on the bottom. the bile is denser because it contains microscopic particles usually cholesterol or pigment embedded in mucus. (the mucus is secreted by the gallbladder). over time sludge may remain in the gallbladder it may disappear and not return or it may come and go. these particles may be precursors of gallstones and they occur often in some situations in which gallstones frequently appear for example rapid weight loss pregnancy and with prolonged fasting. nevertheless it appears that sludge goes on to become gallstones in only a minority of people. it is not clear how often -- if at all -- sludge alone causes problems. sludge has been blamed for many of the same symptoms as gallstones -- biliary colic cholecystitis and pancreatitis but often these symptoms and complications are caused by very small gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. it is also possible that these gallstone-like symptoms and complications are actually caused by small gallstones that have passed through the ducts and into the intestine rather than the sludge itself. thus there is uncertainty about the meaning of sludge. but it is clear that sludge is not the equivalent of gallstones. the practical implication of this uncertainty is that unless someone's symptoms are typical of gallstones sludge should not be considered the cause of the symptoms."

    "Answer": "the only person that could answer that question would be a fertility specialist who is working with both of you -- someone who knows your husband's sperm count/motility and someone who knows if you are ovulating properly. testosterone may not insure fertility and vitamins will do little to influence your ability as a couple to conceive."

    "Answer": "talk to your doctor about it during your regular checkup and immediately if it starts to get worse. it could just be a mild muscle tic caused by fatigue or maybe an issue with your electrolyte levels."

    "Answer": "about 2% of the children who are vaccinated develop a very mild case of chickenpox usually with no more than five to six blisters. it is also possible for a person who has been vaccinated for chickenpox to develop chickenpox at some later point in life. when that happens the disease is almost always milder and the recovery more rapid than for people who have not had the shots. it's important to keep in mind that up to 90% of the people who get the vaccine will not catch chickenpox"

    "Question": "what causes the poison ivy rash?",
    "Answer": "poison ivy is a common cause of contact dermatitis an allergic reaction to something that comes in direct contact with the skin. this condition can be quite unpleasant but does not pose serious health risks. prevention is better than treatment but can be hard to achieve. poison ivy is one of many plants that produce a resin called an urushiol that can cause an allergic rash. related plants include the familiar poison oak and sumac which are found in different geographical distributions. (poison ivy is more common in the eastern u. s. and poison oak in the southeast). the rashes that each of these plants produce have a similar appearance. in addition the same urushiols are also found in the mango cashew and gingko trees. in the case of mangos peeling the fruit prevents dermatitis. people who press the whole fruit including the rind against their skin can develop a severe reaction around the mouth. those downwind from burning vegetation containing one of the offending plants can also develop widespread allergic reactions. identifying poison ivy although it is often recommended that people learn to recognize the poison ivy plant (\"leaves of three leave them be\") in practice this is hard to do since poison ivy and its relatives are often mixed in with other vegetation and not noticed until after the rash has begun. keeping the skin covered in situations in which exposure is hard to avoid is the best way to prevent the problem. more than half the population can react to the poison ivy resin if they are exposed to it."

    "Answer": "where did all the quarter-pounders go? suddenly half-pound hamburgers are all you see on restaurant menus anymore. how is this a good thing? sure you could split the burger with someone but what are the odds that your meal companion is also going to want a burger? the other option is to cut it in half and take the other half home but you aren’t always going to be able to safely deliver the leftovers to your refrigerator within two hours. plus you probably don’t want to eat a hamburger two days in a row. sounds a little nutty but we actually played this out this scenario at the table a few weeks ago when my daughter wanted to order a hamburger in a restaurant that only offered half-pounders. we ended up telling the servers to make a quarter-pounder patty instead for her (still paid for the half pounder though). over the next few weeks we noticed that several other restaurants only offered half-pound burgers as well. i was hoping we were going in the opposite direction and eating smaller burgers not larger ones. share the monster burger and you would still be getting around 400 calories 23 grams of fat and 10 grams of saturated fat. perhaps it’s simply better to look for a more healthful menu option."

    "Answer": "i guess the safest advice to give you is to call your surgeon's office for some guidance. on the one hand the bruise-like mark on your lower abdomen doesn't surprise me after a laparoscopy. but the warmness in your legs sounds a bit unusual. in a laparoscopy procedure three small incisions are made in the abdomen. one of these cuts is in the belly button. because gravity will pull \"old blood\" (such as in a bruise) toward the feet that mark you see on your belly could simply be bruising related to the belly button incision. why your legs would feel warm is a mystery to me. when you speak to your surgeon or his or her nurse be prepared to tell him or her when the symptoms started. this will help them assess if the leg issue is related to the surgery or not. wishing you all the best!"

    "Answer": "i am so sorry to hear about the loss of your first child. if you and your wife are actively trying to get pregnant again it is not the number of sexual encounters/ejaculations in 24 hours that is the issue but rather your timing. it only takes one sperm and you may be producing hundreds of millions each time and one egg at the time of your wife's ovulation yes men do have refractory periods after an ejaculation that can range in time from a half-hour to many hours but again this is not a marathon. don't worry about the number of times that you and your wife have sex but the quality of that specially-timed encounter."

    "Question": "how can a frequent traveler get better sleep?",
    "Answer": "if you’re traveling west what time of day is your flight actually can be a pretty big factor for you. so if you’re normally a pretty sleep deprived person you may use a 3 or 4 hour plane flight to get a little bit of extra rest. be careful because when you arrive if it’s near nighttime you may not be able to fall back asleep. so if you’re going to use the plane to allow yourself to get more sleep i would say i want you traveling in the morning because that leaves you a lot of time to get tired during the day so you can fall asleep at night. if you’re traveling in the opposite direction then the opposite would be true. then you would want to travel more towards the evening because then it’s closer to time for bed. what’s in my travel sleep kit is usually eye shades ear plugs some sort of clip for the drapes. when you go to hotel rooms usually the air conditioner is right underneath the drapes and it parts the drapes and the sun kind of hits you in the morning so have something for the drapes. when you check into your hotel ask if you can be placed on a top floor because that’s usually far away from street noise. you want your room to be facing west and not east so you don’t want to get the sun early in the morning. and ask if there’s a way you can be placed not next to families with small children a hockey team whatever because the noise factor can be a big one. i’ve actually had some patients tell me that they sleep better on the road than they do at home because at home they don’t get interruptions it’s not nearly as stressful because they are not dealing with big emotional issues usually on the road so i’ve had many people tell me that they they do pretty well. they get used to sleeping on the road. for those folks what i often tell them is try to stay in the same hotel try to stay in the same rooms so you can increase your familiarity. have your travel sleep kit. the other thing that is good is to add a night light to your travel sleep kit. the reason is when you wake up in the middle of the night if you’ve been entertaining drinking alcohol or coffee you don’t want to flip on the light because then that tells your brain that it’s daytime. some people have a difficult time sleeping in a hotel because it’s unfamiliar and they are fearful from a safety perspective. and so there are door alarms that you can hang over your door so that if anybody jiggles the handle an alarm will sound. that will usually have them move away and allow you to call security or whatever you may need. white noise is a great thing for people to sleep with and there are even some small sound generators that you can bring with you. and unfamiliar sounds can kind of keep you pretty awake everything from air conditioners turning on to a noisy neighbor in a hotel or things like that."

    "Question": "how is low blood pressure treated?",
    "Answer": "low blood pressure in healthy subjects without symptoms or organ damage needs no treatment. however all patients with symptoms possibly due to low blood pressure should be evaluated by a doctor. (patients who have had a major drop in blood pressure from their usual levels even without the development of symptoms also should be evaluated. ) the doctor needs to identify the cause of the low blood pressure; remedies will depend on the cause. for example if a medication is causing the low blood pressure the dose of medication may have to be reduced or the medication stopped though only after consulting the doctor. self-adjustment of medication should not be done. dehydration is treated with fluids and minerals (electrolytes). mild dehydration without nausea and vomiting can be treated with oral fluids and electrolytes. moderate to severe dehydration usually is treated in the hospital or emergency room with intravenous fluids and electrolytes. blood loss can be treated with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. continuous and severe bleeding needs to be treated immediately. septic shock is an emergency and is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. blood pressure medications or diuretics are adjusted changed or stopped by the doctor if they are causing low blood pressure symptoms. bradycardia may be due to a medication. the doctor may reduce change or stop the medication. bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or heart block is treated with an implantable pacemaker. tachycardia is treated depending on the nature of the tachycardia. atrial fibrillation can be treated with oral medications electrical cardioversion or a catheterization procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. ventricular tachycardia can be controlled with medications or with an implantable defibrillator. pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is treated with blood thinners intravenous initially with heparin and oral warfarin (coumadin) later. pericardial fluid can be removed by a procedure called pericardiocentesis. postural hypotension can be treated with changes in diet such as increasing water and salt intake* increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels) using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins and in some patients the use of a medication called midodrine (proamatine). the problem with proamatine is that while it increases blood pressure in the upright position the supine blood pressure may become too high thus increasing the risk of strokes. mayo clinic researchers found that a medication used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis called pyridostigmine (mestinon) increases upright blood pressure but not supine blood pressure. mestinon an anticholinesterase medication works on the autonomic nervous system especially when a person is standing up. side effects include minor abdominal cramping or increased frequency of bowel movements. *note: increasing salt intake can lead to heart failure in patients with existing heart disease and should not be undertaken without consulting a doctor. postprandial hypotension refers to low blood pressure occurring after meals. ibuprofen (motrin) or indomethacin (indocin) may be beneficial. vasovagal syncope can be treated with several types of drugs such as beta blockers [for example propanolol (inderal inderal la)] selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [fluoxetine (prozac) escitalopram oxalate (lexapro) paroxetine (paxil) sertraline (zoloft) citalopram (celexa) fluvoxamine (luvox)] fludrocortisone (florinef) (a drug that prevents dehydration by causing the kidney(s) to retaining water). a pacemaker can also be helpful when a patient fails drug therapy."

    "Question": "is what i have a bartholin's cyst? . i've had cysts before and this one is much different. it is on the one side of my vagina opening (which is typical) but it remains very hard even though i've taken warm baths it does not drain it out it is extremely hard and purple. is it normal that it's purple in color? it is the most painful cyst i've ever had and i've never had any issues in draining it before. not sure what to do. is this a normal cyst?",
    "Answer": "i have no way of diagnosing (or treating) you blindly over the internet but a bartholin cyst is most likely what you have. since this cyst is painful (and engorged) it would be wise to see a gynecologist right away so it can be properly drained. if this cyst is recurrent you may need a marsupilization procedure where the entire cyst sac is removed to keep it from coming back."

    "Question": "what are some exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes?",
    "Answer": "to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia if you have diabetes follow a regular routine of exercising eating your meals and taking your medicines at the same time each day. prolonged or strenuous exercise can cause your body to produce adrenaline and other hormones that can counteract the effects of insulin and cause your blood sugar to rise. if you are participating in strenuous exercise (exercising at your maximum capacity) or prolonged exercise (lasting for several hours or more) your insulin and/or oral diabetic medicine may need to be changed. talk to your health care provider about how to adjust your medicine. be careful exercising when your medicine is reaching its peak effect. depending on the time of exercise reducing your dose of either long-acting insulin or short-acting insulin will be necessary. your doctor can recommend how to make this adjustment. exercise with someone who knows you have diabetes and knows what to do if you have a low blood-sugar reaction. wear a medical identification tag (for example medicalert) or carry an identification card that states you have diabetes. the american diabetes association offers these basic exercise guidelines for those with diabetes: discuss with your doctor what types of exercise might be appropriate for you. complications of diabetes such as severe eye disease and nerve damage may make some forms of exercise dangerous for you. your doctor may also schedule a test to see how your heart responds to exercise. do not exercise if your blood sugar is greater than 250 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter) and your ketones are positive. this is an indication that you already may have a lack of insulin and exercise will only cause a greater rise in your blood sugar. hydrate yourself and adjust your insulin as necessary contact your health care provider. use caution when exercising if your blood sugar is greater than 300 mg/dl without evidence of ketones. exercise may help decrease your sugars but it's possible they will increase instead. hydrate well prior to and after exercise and keep track of your sugars and ketones. learn the effects of various types of exercise on your blood sugar. have carbohydrate-based foods available for exercise and for the period following exercise. add carbohydrates to your meals if you plan on doing exercise adjust your insulin dose appropriately in anticipation of exercise."

    "Question": "what causes and who is at risk for brain tumors?",
    "Answer": "no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. doctors can seldom explain why one person develops a brain tumor and another does not. however it is clear that brain tumors are not contagious. no one can \"catch\" the disease from another person. research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. a risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease. the following risk factors are associated with an increased chance of developing a primary brain tumor: being male -- in general brain tumors are more common in males than females. however meningiomas are more common in females. race -- brain tumors occur more often among white people than among people of other races. age -- most brain tumors are detected in people who are 70 years old or older. however brain tumors are the second most common cancer in children. (leukemia is the most common childhood cancer. ) brain tumors are more common in children younger than 8 years old than in older children. family history -- people with family members who have gliomas may be more likely to develop this disease. being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals at work: radiation -- workers in the nuclear industry have an increased risk of developing a brain tumor. formaldehyde -- pathologists and embalmers who work with formaldehyde have an increased risk of developing brain cancer. scientists have not found an increased risk of brain cancer among other types of workers exposed to formaldehyde. vinyl chloride -- workers who make plastics may be exposed to vinyl chloride. this chemical may increase the risk of brain tumors. acrylonitrile -- people who make textiles and plastics may be exposed to acrylonitrile. this exposure may increase the risk of brain cancer. scientists are investigating whether cell phones may cause brain tumors. studies thus far have not found an increased risk of brain tumors among people who use cell phones. scientists also continue to study whether head injuries are a risk factor for brain tumors. so far these studies have not found an increased risk among people who have had head injuries. most people who have known risk factors do not get brain cancer. on the other hand many who do get the disease have none of these risk factors. people who think they may be at risk should discuss this concern with their doctor. the doctor may be able to suggest ways to reduce the risk and can plan an appropriate schedule for checkups."

    "Answer": "so sorry to hear you're going through this! how unpleasant. many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here. if you spike a fever (over 101 degrees) then it's time to seek medical attention. if you don't have a thermometer for taking your temperature i recommend you get one. it's impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether they're sweating or things like that. you really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately. if you're not feverish then you probably can take a wait-and-see attitude. drink plenty of fluids and don't try eating anything while you're actively vomiting or nauseated (sick to your stomach). if the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider. i hope you feel better soon! also i keep rotating between overheating and overcooling. have been keeping my sweater on anyways."

    "Answer": "you're correct that it does take some time for these types of medications to reach their full effectiveness. i'm sorry you're feeling side effects after switching from one medication to another. i want to make sure you know it's not abnormal to experience mild side effects while in the process of switching medications but if you start having feelings of severe depression suicide or hurting yourself or others you need to take immediate action by calling your health care provider or dialing 911. if the side effects you're experiencing are relatively mild and you don't feel you're in a mental health crisis situation you should still call your health care provider to discuss the side effects you're experiencing. your doctor can advise you about what to do to help alleviate these symptoms or at least let you know if what you're feeling is normal for the situation. it may not take a full 6 weeks for you to begin experiencing the full effects of the zoloft. each person is different in this respect. i'm hoping things will smooth out for you soon. i'm sorry you're going through this. get ahold of your health care provider and hang in there! ask your doctor about cymbalta. it is now in a generic form and is very affordable. i tried everything (no joke) when i was first diagnosed with depression / anxiety and cymbalta is what works best for me."

    "Answer": "sorry to hear you're going through this. from your description it sounds like you're experiencing moderate constipation that is causing a hemorrhoid to flare up occasionally. a hemorrhoid is a swollen vein in the rectum. a hard piece of stool can basically scratch this swollen vein and cause it to bleed slightly. frequently hemorrhoids also feel itchy and painful. perhaps this is why your doctor gave you a suppository to try. suppositories often are prescribed to treat the symptoms of hemorrhoids. it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids. because only the tip of your stool is hard it makes me think maybe you're not noticing the urge to have a bowel movement and are holding stool in your rectum too long. even though you're having a bowel movement every day you might try going to the bathroom a bit more frequently to see if you perhaps need to have a bowel movement but just aren't feeling the sensation to go. however do not strain needlessly in an attempt to force a bowel movement. that will just make any hemorrhoid situation worse. as long as you're not allergic to any medications you also might try an over-the-counter hemorrhoid medication to see if it helps shrink those swollen veins so at least the bleeding goes away. best of luck to you! this is what worked for me. as mentioned above fibrous food. i included boiled okra(twice a week for dinner) apple daily spinach (i'm an indian and i already love indian \"plain palak\" recipie dried plums(pitted prunes) 2liters of water a day. ( i follow this since i first came across this siuation) walking min of 30 mins a day. i also felt stress tension has played a role in causing this(to me atleast) i have the same problem which lead me to your thread. while i have had issues around constipation currently i have at least three bm's a day. and yes this hard piece is scraping against my hemorrhoid and causing pain and sometimes a little bleeding. i would think the answer might lie in what we are eating the combinations of food at each meal and how they digest. this issue doenst always happen for me but it is often"

    "Answer": "chronic health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. be sure to get these conditions under control before you become pregnant since they pose risks to both you and your baby. careful medical monitoring begun before conception and continued throughout your pregnancy can reduce the risks associated with these conditions. high blood pressure and diabetes can develop for the first time during pregnancy and women over the age of 30 are at increased risk. if you are pregnant and over age 35 this makes it especially important that you get early and regular prenatal care to ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment. stillbirth (delivery of a baby that has died before birth) is more common in women over age 35. older women are also more likely to have low-birth weight babies (weighing less than 5. 5 pounds at birth). cesarean birth is also slightly more common for women having their first child after age 35."

    "Answer": "that would depend on the location of the herniated disk. if it was in lumbar area then this would be possible. if the disk was in your neck then. no. in my situation i have a herniated disk that is touching my sciatic nerve which is causing severe lower back pain that radiates down my buttocks leg and foot. the only relief i have is sitting down. standing walking or laying flat causes the disc to push against the sciatic nerve and sitting releases the pressure. so yes a herniated disc can radiate down the leg and butt."

    "Question": "my husband frequently says that his testicles are sweaty. he wipes them down with rubbing alcohol is this ok?",
    "Answer": "a shower would be better followed by a change of underwear (boxers instead of briefs) and perhaps some talcum or corn starch in the groin to help absorb the sweating. rubbing alcohol is not harmful but it can be pretty cold. if he had any open wounds or rashes in his groin you would likely see him dance around a bit (it burns! )."

    "Answer": "if you were properly diagnosed with influenza (tamiflu will not help any other viral infection) know that this drug does not \"cure\" the flu or treat specific symptoms. it briefly shortens the course of the flu and alleviates the severity. immediate or dramatic improvemenst in flu-symptoms are usually not seen. if you are still having a sore throat on day two of the flu then you can treat this symptom separately: gargling with warm salt water taking ibuprofen for the pain/inflammation and drinking lots of fluids. throat lozenges can also help."

    "Question": "is hair loss in women different than men?",
    "Answer": "female-pattern baldness women lose hair on an inherited (genetic) basis too but the female pattern tends to be more diffuse with less likelihood of the crown and frontal hairline being lost. although some women may notice hair thinning as early as their 20s the pace of hair loss tends to be gradual often taking years to become obvious to others. there seems to be a normal physiologic thinning that comes with age and occurs in many women in their early to mid 30s. more women have underlying causes of hair loss than men. these include treatable conditions like anemia and thyroid disease. in particular women with a form of thyroid disease called hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis may have hair loss. these conditions are diagnosed by blood tests. although a few studies have suggested that baldness may be inherited through the mother's family genes these theories require further testing. current studies are inconclusive. while stories about hats choking off follicles or long hair pulling on the roots may be more folklore repeat hair trauma like tightly woven hair pulled back and consistent friction can potentially worsen or cause localized hair loss in some individuals. black individuals who pull their hair tightly back in a rubber band can develop a localized hair loss at the front of the scalp. hair loss \"myths\" of special concern to women: longer hair does not necessarily put a strain on roots. shampooing does not accelerate hair loss; it just removes those that were ready to fall out anyway. coloring perming and conditioning the hair do not usually cause hair loss. burns or severe processing may cause hair loss and breakage. styles that pull tight may cause some loss but hair coloring and \"chemicals\" usually don't."

    "Answer": "the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis can be similar to rheumatoid arthritis with morning pain and stiffness along with fatigue. you may have pain and stiffness in the hands wrists elbows shoulders knees ankles feet and spine. arthritis that affects many joints symmetrically is common with psoriatic arthritis. this symmetrical pattern is almost the same as rheumatoid arthritis. yet sometimes psoriatic arthritis joints are less tender than rheumatoid arthritis joints so you may have joint deformity with psoriatic arthritis without significant pain. with psoriasis you may have thick inflamed red skin patches (called plaques) covered with white or silvery scales usually on the elbows knees or other areas. in addition more than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have nail involvement with pitted discolored or thickened nails. psoriatic arthritis can cause a sausage-like swelling of fingers and toes which usually occurs when the fingernails are pitted or discolored. in some people with psoriatic arthritis only one joint is affected yet not the other (one knee only for example). sometimes the spine is affected or just the fingers and toes. about 1/3 of patients with psoriatic arthritis have eye problems such as conjunctivitis or pink eye."

    "Answer": "lack of a bowel movement for 3 days doesn't by itself indicate constipation. constipation is defined based on each individual's normal bowel habits. some people only have one bowel movement every few days. other people have a bm every day. you need to determine your boyfriend's normal bowel routine before jumping to a conclusion of constipation. assuming this is constipation however if laxatives pills aren't working you have some other over-the-counter options to try. if your boyfriend is otherwise healthy he probably can safely drink a bottle of magnesium citrate liquid laxative. follow this immediately with 8 ounces of water. usually this will induce a bowel movement pretty rapidly. if that doesn't work you can try a glycerine suppository. this is inserted into the rectum to induce a bm. use it only as directed on the label. or you can try a disposable enema (often called a fleet enema) enemas are generally considered safe to use and will help get those bowels moving again. no guy i know would voluntarily submit to an enema. you need to emphasize to him that small disposable enemas aren't too uncomfortable to use -- and they're way less uncomfortable than emergency surgery for a bowel resection due to an obstruction. maybe that will help persuade him if things get to that point. if your boyfriend still can't have a bowel movement starts vomiting and/or begins running a fever (over 101f) you need to seek immediate medical treatment. these could be signs of a bowel obstruction or something unrelated to constipation. wishing you both all the best!"

    "Answer": "the most common cause of sore throat is a virus and most will last about a week unless of course you are developing a particularly nasty viral infection called mononucleosis (mono). if your sore throat does not resolve in a week your doctor should consider ordering a mono test (ebv panel). hopefully you had a culture done (takes 2-3 days) since rapid strep tests are not 100% accurate. as far as what to do about your \"extreme pain\" i am at a loss since i really have no way of seeing your throat or review your medical history. gargling with warm saline (1/4 tsp of table salt with 8 oz of warm water) can help. ibuprofen can help. again it is not typical to have extreme pain with a simple viral sore throat so you may need to be re-examined."

    "Answer": "i know that it is difficult to feel sick and have no insurance. perhaps you can borrow the money from family or friends to see a primary care doctor and have some basic blood studies done. it seems that the breathing of welding fumes can be hazardous and related to your medical symptoms. a company called plymovent talks about breathing in of welding fumes as follows: the content of the welding rods coatings filler metals and base materials also greatly impacts your health. the biggest potential threat is exposure to the manganese contained in fumes that are given off during welding. inhaling manganese can cause very serious damage to your brain and nervous system. many individuals who are exposed to welding fumes suffer from parkinson’s disease a major disorder affecting movement and balance. they often develop “manganism ” a disease closely related to parkinson’s that also makes it difficult to walk and move properly. both manganism and parkinson’s disease cause tremors shaking and loss of muscle control. these conditions can become more severe as time passes. when the welding rod or base metal is iron or mild steel iron oxide may be contained in the welding fumes in addition to manganese. breathing in iron oxide irritates your nasal passages throat and lungs. working with stainless steel may produce welding fumes containing nickel and chromium. if you have asthma exposure to nickel can make your illness worse. chromium can aggravate or cause sinus problems. both nickel and chromium may cause cancer according to niosh (safety and health fact sheet no. 4 american welding society; welding fumes and gases center to protect workers’ rights). welding on some plated or painted metals may be especially hazardous (welding fumes sampling mine safety and health administration). cadmium is often used as a coating on steel to prevent rust. however cadmium in welding fumes causes the lung disease emphysema as well as kidney failure (cadmium exposure from welding american welding society; welding health hazards osha). if you cut a metal that has been coated with paint that contains lead it may give off welding fumes containing lead oxide. inhaling these welding fumes can cause lead poisoning a condition in which you become weak and develop anemia (a low red blood cell count). lead also harms your nervous system kidneys and reproductive system (lead atsdr). some welding rods are coated with asbestos. if you inhale asbestos dust that is released into the air you are at risk for developing serious asbestos–related diseases. these include lung cancer an aggressive cancer called mesothelioma and asbestosis which is a scarring of the lungs. i don’t want all of these many medical conditions to cause you great worry or to become obsessed with thoughts of doom. i just wanted to honestly tell you what honest research has to say about breathing in welding fumes. of course your danger from incurring any of the above referenced medical conditions is probably directly related to the amount of time spent welding and the quantity of exposure material."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer i'll answer this from an insurance perspective. perhaps one of the other webmd experts with a medical background can respond with regard to the medical need. if you’ve been doing the same thing for years and your doctor still feels it’s needed you can appeal your insurer’s decision to limit your use of disposable bags. first you can ask for your provider's help in gathering information or collect medical journal articles that support the treatment's use by searching journal articles with pubmed a service of the u. s. national library of medicine at www. pubmed. gov. you can use this information as part of your appeal which both state and federal law entitle you to. at least two levels of appeals are available to you — an internal appeal with your insurer and a review by an independent third party. your insurer must provide you with written information about how to initiate the process."

    "Question": "how do i keep track of how much medication is in my metered dose inhaler?",
    "Answer": "check the side of the canister for the number of puffs it contains. then keep track of how many times you use it each day. this way you can estimate when your metered dose inhaler is likely to run out. put that date right on the canister. be sure to have your prescription refilled one to two days before this date. some mdi's contain a color-coded side window that indicates when the medication is running out. it may be difficult for you to keep track of how much you use your inhaler -- perhaps because you only use it every once in a while as a rescue medication. if so ask your doctor about mdis that count the puffs each time you press the inhaler. or ask about getting two inhalers at a time. when one runs out get a refill so you always have an inhaler handy. throw away the mdi when it is empty even if it continues to spray."

    "Question": "if i have alot of anger stress and emotional baggage what is the best sport i could exercise or learn to help me vent?",
    "Answer": "exercise can help you manage stress by releasing endorphins which are neurotransmitters in your brain that help you to feel good. another benefit of exercise for stress management is that it can also be used as a break or as personal time away from your stressors to clear your head if necessary. exercise can also help with depression and anxiety and can help improve your sleep help you to feel better or boost your energy levels. there is no one type of exercise that will help you manage stress better than any other. the main thing that you need to find is a type of exercise that you enjoy doing. exercise should come naturally and should be something that you look forward to doing not something that you feel forced to do and don’t get enjoyment out of. remember this is about making yourself happy so you may have to experiment with different activities until you find something that really works well for you. set realistic goals that are achievable and dedicate an amount of time that you find manageable so that you’re not adding more stress or creating another burden. besides exercise there are many other stress-reduction techniques like journaling meditating using breathing exercises or mental/guided imagery. you could also meet with a psychologist psychiatrist or your doctor to discuss other treatment/management options. hi a big sorry that should read rugby otherwise we don't wont you running around looking for ruby to get rid of your anger she would not like it? then again? good luck hi first your stress google natural ways out of stress lots of ideas for you to look at even meditation may help you. \\as for your emotional baggage possible therapy could be a lot of help if you go to the right person who can talk over your problems with they say a problem shared is a problem halved. but if you need to get rid of anger try some english ruby may be just what you want get with the right team its ruff and tough. hope this helps. good luck hi yes back again i was doing some searching this afternoon and found this its packed with info for ways out of stress the link <link> good luck i too have a great deal of almost constant seething anger. i used to do competitive sports but found that ultimately they made me even angrier. i discovered peace wonder a sense of personal power the release of anger and adventure in hiking and walking. suggestion: get an ipod or similar device if you can with some of your favorite music on it. find a nice park and look for good hiking trails. wear rugged clothes and good shoes. don't push too hard just hard enough to release tensions burn up the excess stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol and bring forth your body's natural endorphins and serotonin which will make you feel good and appreciate the beauty around you. after you hike stretch to cool down to prevent muscle cramps and be sure to rest well; allow more than enough time to sleep and clear your mind of worries as you rest. i live in a noisy place without as much privacy as i'd like and i use my ipod when i rest too with soft soothing music that helps me fall asleep. some people use a fan or other \"white noise\". when you are actively angry you cannot digest food but once you've calmed down eat food that will replenish the resources you've burned up because anger uses up a lot of the body's natural fuel. be sure to stay hydrated throughout. it may take some time but gradually this just might help. good luck."

    "Question": "is it safe to \"push through\" fibromyalgia pain? . every time i even attempt to do any sort of exercise the pain doesn't really allow me to do anything. i used to be an athlete many years ago and i would just push through the pain or keep going until the pain went away. i haven't been able to work for years since my accident and fibromyalgia and it is very frustrating. . i am wondering if i can do any damage to my body if i push through the pain? . is it safe to force my body to work through the pain and attempt exercise?",
    "Answer": "i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it. if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks. i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want. but there are painful consequences. it could cause you to be unable to do anything. i just know that \"pacing yourself\" is the watch word here. pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life. it's harder to do than say and requires practice. we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities. i hope this help. start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up. i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non-contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about. good luck hope this helps. and do not forget to stretch!"

    "Question": "what are bacterial and viral infections?",
    "Answer": "bacterial and viral infections have many similarities. both types of infections are caused by microbes -- bacteria and viruses respectively -- and spread by routes such as: coughing and sneezing. contact with contaminated people especially through activities such as kissing and sexual intercourse. contact with contaminated surfaces food and water. contact with contaminated creatures including household pets livestock and insects such as fleas and ticks. microbes can also cause: acute infections which are short-lived. chronic infections which can last for weeks months or a lifetime. latent infections which may not initially cause symptoms but which can reactivate over a period of months and years. most importantly bacterial and viral infections -- which are defined as an invasion of microbes able to reproduce in the body -- can cause mild moderate and severe disease. throughout history millions of people have succumbed to diseases such as bubonic plague or the black death which is caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium and smallpox which is caused by the variola virus. in recent times viral infections have been responsible for two major pandemics: the 1918-1919 “spanish flu” epidemic that killed 20-40 million people and the ongoing hiv/aids epidemic that killed an estimated 2 million people worldwide in 2008 alone. bacterial and viral infections can cause similar symptoms such as coughing and sneezing fever inflammation vomiting diarrhea fatigue and cramping -- all of which are ways the immune system tries to rid the body of infectious organisms. but bacterial and viral infections are dissimilar in many other important respects most of them due to the organisms' structural differences and the way they respond to currently available antimicrobial medications."

    "Answer": "it is very hard when a loved one is no longer able to communicate her needs to her caregiver. in this case you need to be sure that she is safe and not in any pain or discomfort. a checkup with her doctor is the first step. the doctor will need to know how long she has been upset at night and if there have been any changes to her care or surroundings that could help explain her behavior. persons who have dementia are often more confused and frightened at night or in unfamiliar surroundings. after a thorough exam the doctor will be able to discuss a care plan that can help both of you. this constant care and lack of sleep can put a lot of strain on the caregivers. your local area council on aging or state department of aging can provide resources to help you cope. webmd also has a slide show that may help called “14 ways to prevent caregiver burnout”. <link> i'm sorry to hear you and your loved one are going through this. it's hard to help when a person can't communicate. i'd suggest you have your loved one checked out by a doctor. whenever an elderly person exhibits odd symptoms the first thing that comes to mind is a urinary tract infection (uti). while these often cause delirium in a patient (as opposed to the physical actions you're describing) it might be a good idea to rule out a uti. at the same time a health care provider may be able to shed some light on why your loved one is exhibiting these symptoms. perhaps she's having pain she can't communicate. it's hard to tell without a physical exam and a knowledge of her medical history. i wish you both all the best!"

    "Answer": "yes one can survive quite a while on ivs but there would need to be special fluids that provide additional nutritional support (calories) not just fluid replacement. nasogastric tubes (through the nose and into the stomach) can be inserted to put special nutritional solutions directly in the stomach or a surgical portal can be put int he stomach to do the same. for this is only for a short time iv fluids will suffice. of course a confused person would have to tolerate any of these tubes and not pull them out."

    "Answer": "widespread concerns about the economy and job security have recently generated news stories about an increase in men requesting vasectomies. . with this in mind i looked back at my own practice and spoke to a number of urologists. for many it does seem that more men are requesting vasectomy. this fits with what we know about past drops in childbirth rates during tough economic times. when money is tight limiting family size is a common theme. after all raising a child is not cheap. . i have seen an increase in both vasectomies and vasectomy reversals in my own practice over the past 6 months. many of my patients are worried about the economy and how this will impact on their personal finances. these concerns have made many couples rethink their own home situation. as fears increase it appears that families are turning inwards. some parents feel they are complete and so opt for permanent sterilization via vasectomy. for others this introspection leads to a different conclusion. some that have had a vasectomy realize that they do want more children and so move ahead with a vasectomy reversal."

    "Answer": "great idea on starting a food log! since you have both nerve damage and fibromyalgia you are going to have to ease change into your life. so you don't stir your symptoms up. also a quick phone call to your doctor to make sure they are ok with you exercising would be a good first step as well. after you have your doctor's ok here are a few ideas. 1. recumbent stationary bike: these type of exercise bikes have a chair seat and are much more comfortable for individuals with back problems. start slow with just 5 minutes three times a week then as your tolerance builds add a second session of 5 minutes later in the day until eventually you can work up to either 2-15 minute sessions a day or 3-10 minute sessions a day. by splitting your sessions up that should make you more comfortable and avoid aggravating your spine and your fibromyalgia. 2. water aerobics: by moving in water your heart and muscles get the benefits of exercise without all the stress on your spine. look around your community and i'm sure you will find a number of places that offer these. on the day of your first class arrive early and explain to the instructor your limitations so they can provide you with some modifications to exercises that might exacerbate your problem. 3. visit webmd's fibromyalgia center: click on the hyperlink below to be taken there. webmd fibromyalgia center you'll find tons of info on how to maximize your health. there is also a community forum that enables you to talk with others with fibromyalgia that way you can find ideas and strategies that worked for them. 4. don't try to change everything at once. pick one item and work on it then when you've mastered that move onto the next item. for example now that writing down what you eat is a habit pick another one--exercise for example. call around and find a water aerobics class and set a goal of attending 2 classes a week. once you've completed that goal then pick another-------------sleep for example. after you visit the fibromyalgia center you will be amazed how many people are living active lives and managing their symptoms. you can definitely lose weight just take it slow."

    "Answer": "that's a good question. you'd think a stye would have cleared up by now. first off i would suggest seeing one doctor repeatedly instead of going from doctor to doctor. seeing the same doctor for a given condition offers continuity of care. perhaps you've been going to urgent care facilities where you don't get a choice of which doctor you see. if possible get set up with a primary care provider and get started on solving the stye problem. it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical exam so the only advice i can give you is to go back to the doctor -- preferably the last one you saw for the condition. it's possible you've developed a second eye condition that has nothing to do with the stye. sometimes coincidences happen. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "i am glad you raised this question. bupropion is the generic or chemical name of the drug and budeprion and wellbutrin are brand names. drugs can have both a generic name and a brand name. the fda released a statement that the brand named medication; budeprion xl 300 mg is not therapeutically equivalent to the brand named medication wellbutrin xl 300 mg. this means that these two versions of bupropion xl 300 mg do not work the same when given to patients. when a suffix or ending is attached to a drug that refers to how often it is taken. bupropion xl (extended release) is taken once daily; bupropion sr (sustained release) and is taken twice daily; and bupropion 300 mg (immediate release) is taken 3 times daily. the fda statement pertained only to the xl 300 mg dose. when brand named medications lose their patents different manufacturers can make their version or the medication can be marketed under the generic name. generic and brand named drugs should contain the exact same active drug and have the same dosage intended use action side effects risks and safety. the difference between generics and different brands of the same drug is that they may vary in the inactive components. these inactive components include dyes and fillers. the fda does studies to make sure that all the different brands and generic formulations are the same. the fda did the studies on the dose of bupropion xl 150 mg and concluded that all the manufacturers were making equivalent medications. the fda did not study the 300 mg dose but assumed the 300 mg would be just as good. due to complaints from patients the fda finally studied the 300 mg dose and found that the budeprion and the wellbutrin version of bupropion xl 300 mg were not the same. there was a difference in the rate to which they were released into the blood stream. there are ongoing studies on the manufacturers of other versions of bupropion xl 300 mg. some physicians feel that the differences in the inactive components of a drug do influence the availability of a drug to the target tissue (bioavailability). this difference is not usually felt to be clinically significant. talk to your doctor about your use of bupropion to determine whether the formulation you are using is the right one for you."

    "Question": "i am 51 and a woman and way overweight by about 60lbs. . my blood pressure has been 128 over 82 and 130 over 89 just this week. are these good blood pressure readings?",
    "Answer": "your blood pressure readings would be considered as normal-high. it is a good practice to regularly check your blood pressure. i would consider the following steps to use that data for your overall benefit: keep a journal detailing the readings the time taken activities involved with prior to obtaining the reading machine used for testing and the time of day; use a different machine and vary the time of day for the test taking; in a separate area of the journal list all foods and beverages consumed during the entire day; also list exercise activities throughout the day; drink at least 64 ounces of water daily; reduce stress in your life; cut back on caffeine and alcohol; do not smoke; take your journal with you for your next family doctor office visit. talk to the doctor about recommendations for weight loss. by cutting back on calories and burning additional calories totaling 500 calories per day you'll trim back by about (1) pound per week. this time next year you'll probably look and feel 20 years younger. and yes i would almost bet the house that your blood pressure will also take a positive drop downwards. i wish you happiness and good health."

    "Question": "i have been thinking about buying drugs online to save money is that a good idea?",
    "Answer": "i would advice this patient that they need to just go proceed with caution. we are finding out that lot of online pharmacies actually take drugs from other countries and send them overseas. so we can't guarantee the products that you get through the internet are really what you think you are getting. so it could be kind of big problem in a small package. so i would highly recommend that if you are going to -- basically what are prescription medications over the internet or through mail-order go through major companies based in united states these are also chains that have stores. we could actually walk into a store and get a prescription refilled and you want to be able to talk a pharmacist you know when you are doing with online you are not going to be able to talk to anybody if you have a question about is it going to interact with my medicine? it's actually a little bit risky. so patients need to understand that the pharmacist is a key person that they need to make sure as part of their healthcare routine the internet is free for some things but not for medications."

    "Question": "can you get genital herpes from a pelvic exam? . i have been married for 19 years and we even use a condom when having sex. we both have always been healthy. i recently had a pap smear done and on that same day felt very swollen in my vagina. the next day we tried to have sex but it was too painful and couldnt. then i noticed a bump followed by by more bumps and high fevers the following few days. the bumps turned into sores. they checked me and said it is herpes. could i have gotten from the tools they used to check me?",
    "Answer": "that would be highly unlikely since those \"tools\" (a vaginal speculum) would need to be unwashed unsterilized and still wet from a previous patient that had genital herpes. most vaginal speculums are not plastic disposable ones. many clinicians still use metal ones but these must be autoclaved (sterilized) before any subsequent use. make sure your diagnosis of herpes is laboratory confirmed not just by clinical observation before you let your mind run amok. while it is not uncommon for a married man to stray and have sex with someone else you need to make sure the diagnosis is correct. since genital herpes is almost always sexually-transmitted it is normal for you to have concerns."

    "Answer": "that is kind of weird isn't it? unfortunately only a physical examination can help figure out what those marks are. from your description they almost sound like stretch marks but the shin would be a very odd place to find stretch marks. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to get them looked at. i don't think they're the hallmark of anything serious but i'm not a doctor. a physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant might see these marks as a sign of some other condition. that's why i'm suggesting you see a doctor. this isn't an emergency situation but it's worth getting checked out. i realize this answer is unsatisfying but i hope you find it helpful!"

    "Question": "what are the side affects of taking 3 to 5 times recomended otc probiotic would it cause unhealthy weight loss. i think this is causing my wife to loss weight by stopping nutrition being absorbed",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as \"natural\" or \"healthy\" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the \"good flora\" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!"

    "Question": "i'm a woman 41 and eat a balanced diet and take a multivitamin. do i need fish oil and calcium too?",
    "Answer": "as a 41-year-old-woman when you think of supplements you consider age gender family medical history your medical history and your specific lifestyle habits (exercise and nutrition). the key is to try to get what you can from whole foods in nutrition. and to do regular exercise (optimally getting in about 30 minutes with some intensity for sure). why? this allows your body to optimize its own physiology so that you can boost immune function and live your best life. that being said studies show that it's tough for most people to get what they need from their usual sources of everyday nutrition. i'd definitely check in with your medical team and discuss supplements as they know your history and can help guide you. and as we get a bit older we have special needs. so a multivitamin that includes iron if you're still menstruating is a basic supplement for most women your age. fish oil is excellent for many reasons and you want to add at the minimum 1000 mg. your medical team may want to increase that based on your history (family and personal) of heart disease. calcium fortified with vit d is a must to prevent osteoporosis. clearly you want to consume calcium-rich foods like dairy but most women do need more and thus the supplement. i would add vit d at 1000 iu as new studies have shown that our current rda is probably too low. vit d (as vit d3 or cholecalciferol) has been shown to be remarkably helpful in boosting immune function all 'round. these are the basics. before taking anything more and turning yourself into a science fair project sit down with your physician and discuss. and please get that physical activity and whole food lifestyle goin'."

    "Answer": "in some cases it actually is not safe. there are some medications that are meant to be split and they have a score down in the middle of them. but however if a tablet is really small and you try to cut it through the line the tablets could easily crumble and therefore you can't guarantee that you're getting the dose that you need. a lot of people become confused too they think that they split it but they really didn't they are not sure what the dosage for maybe. and the other thing is i am finding out more-and-more patients who are trying to cut pills that aren't meant to be split. i recently had a patient who came to me and i found out through a series of questions that she was cutting an extended release tablet that wasn't meant to be cut and she was passing out in her house and it was because of the fact that the drug wasn't releasing the right way because she had destroyed the way it was being released by cutting it in half. so if you have any questions about whether or not your pills or tablet should be cut in half talk to your pharmacist we are going to be able to tell you right away whether or not this is a safe practice to do."

    "Question": "my wife is pregnant (21 weeksish) and our daughter has chicken pox. how much should they avoid eachother? . wife had chicken pox when she was a child. . . . daughter (7 years old) had a vaccine when she was younger.",
    "Answer": "staying away from mom may be difficult but if your daughter truly has an accurately-diagnosed case of chicken pox then she is contagious for about a week. the problem arises in the fact that your daughter was contagious a day or so before she broke out in chicken pox. mom has already been exposed. the incubation of chicken pox is about 14-21 days or so. if your pregnant wife has chicken pox as a child she may be immune. if she doesn't know if she is immune there is an antibody blood test to see if she is even vulnerable. she should bring up this chicken pox exposure to her ob for patient-specific advice but there is a good chance that she will not have any problems whatsoever. subsequent exposure to chicken pox could cause shingles but most of the time it does not."

    "Question": "what is the best way to remove or lighten a dark spot that was caused by the sun and estrogen?",
    "Answer": "the first thing to do is to have a skin cancer screening to make sure that the spots are ok. your dermatologist can then recommend a variety of treatment options depending on the location number and size of the spots. if you are describing the patchy darkness that occurs on the forehead cheeks and upper lip from hormones and sun -- that is usually a form of melasma and for that typically we recommend products that contain hydroquinone retinoids sepi-white as ingredients to look for. other treatments include chemical peels that more dramatically help even out the skin tone and lighten and sometimes even erase the dark spots. if you go in the sun the dark patches will quickly return."

    "Question": "what are the some of the medications used to treat h. pylori?",
    "Answer": "h. pylori is a bacteria that has been found to cause ulcers. there are variety of prescription medications that can be used to treat it usually in combination. it includes antibiotics it includes things like pepto-bismol and it also include things like a proton pump inhibitor. so these combinations of products usually used each day for a number of days have been shown to basically get rid of the bacteria. theory to get rid of the bacteria but ulcer will heal. this needs to be confirmed though through a test that your physician will do to find out whether or not the ulcer you have is being caused by this bacteria. in some cases you may have to space your other medicines with the medicines used to treat h. pylori to make sure that they don't bind to each other. when they bind to each other they may not work as well. so once again talk to your pharmacist about it find out how you are supposed to take it and what to avoid and how to space things. therefore you benefit from taking medication."

    "Question": "my sinus is blocked on the left side of my face. how dod i get this to drain without having surgery. ct scan shows alot of junk on the left side of my face. teeth hurt hoarse at times. been on 1 antibotic for 20 days now going on another round for 30 days along with using nasonex. what else can i do to prevent surgery.",
    "Answer": "stay on those antibiotics and keep using the nasonex. hot or warm facial compresses (20 minutes at a time) can help as well as staying very well hydrated. no one really wants sinus surgery but sometimes that is the only or last resort. hang in there your doctor is doing the best that he can to avoid the operating room by keeping on you an extended course of antibiotics. your situation has probably cleared up by now but i still had to respond because i had the exact same problem a few years ago. i was in the exact same situation. i was taking antibiotics nose spray oral steroids and everything else the doctor could prescribe. one day i read about something called a nedi pot and decided to try it. nothing else worked so i figured why not. there are a few different types and i used the type designed where you put the solution in the container put the tip of the container in one side of your nose lean over a sink and squeeze until the solution comes out the other nostril. then you repeat switching sides. it's a little different design than the traditional nedi pot but i thought it might work better. unfortunately nothing much more than the solution came out. but then about 10 minutes later my left nostril started dripping out a little of the solution (which is not uncommon according to the directions in the kit). so i leaned over the sink held closed my right nostril and blew out threw my left nostril expecting just some remaining solution to come out. a few drops of solution did come out but then all of the sudden to my surprise a massive clump of very thick dark green mucus dropped out of my nostril. i was shocked and amazed. i had never seen anything like it before. and the pain and pressure on the left side of my face was immediately gone. the mucus that was stuck in my front sinus cavity was so thick that the only thing that could get down to it and jar it loose was the warm saline solution that i flushed through my nose and sinuses with the sinus flush kit. and the solution that comes with the kit is a simple all natural saline solution which is safe enough for even a child to use. so for anyone who has ever had sinus facial pain and pressure you must try this sinus flush. and i know this might sound completely disgusting but i wish i had recorded myself doing this flush so i could see it again or even just show people what happened because even to this day i am still amazed at what came out of my nose that day. and all from a kit that cost approx. $10 (i bought the generic store brand) and took about 10 minutes to cure what weeks of taking multiple prescription medications and numerous doctor visits couldn't do."

    "Answer": "hello! there is a slim chance you could be pregnant. however; i don't believe that you are. not unless the condom ( i'm assuming that is what you used? ) broke tore or was defective in some way. which you'd probably notice upon disposal. i think that you are late and now that your stressing about a maybe baby your period is being delayed more so. so lady i say relax! grab yourself a glass of wine a hot bath and good book and try not to think about it. i know it \"sounds\" easier said than done. but worrying isn't going to help you. believe me honey i have been where you are a few times. up until finally getting my period on the very last day of the month or on the first of the next! i wouldn't re- take another test until you haven't received a period by the next month. if it still comes up negative make yourself a doctors appointment if nothing else hearing that your not pregnant from a license doctor along with figuring out whats up with your wonky menstrual cycle will put you at ease."

    "Answer": "i assume that you have been prescribed a brace since you are recovering from a fusion procedure. if so it is unlikley that any type of chair would be very harmful for you as long as you are wearing your brace. some types of furniture that may be helpful to avoid are: ones where your knees have to bend a lot more than 90 degrees for you to get your bottom down to the seat; ones where the cushions are extremely soft causing you to sink down into them; ones that do not have arms that are available to help you get out of the chair; and ones that have a[n] odd angle betwee[n] the seat and the back. recliners in and of themselves are not inappropriate as long as you enter and exit the recliner with the seat in the upright position and you do not recline excessively. it really is primarily an issue of comfort and unfortunately 5 days out from a fusion procedure it is hard to be comfortable in any chair. a lot of that has to do with the surgical pain and dissection of the muscles. this will improve exponentially with time"

    "Answer": "the health care provider will try to find the underlying illness that is causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. at the same time steps will be taken to treat the symptoms and prevent dehydration. any testing will likely be directed to finding the underlying diagnosis. however blood tests may be taken to assess whether the electrolyte balance in the body has been disturbed due to dehydration from continued vomiting. a urinalysis may be done. concentrated urine is associated with dehydration as the kidneys try to hold onto water in the body. ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration."

    "Question": "should a woman be treated for hiv during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "one of the greatest advances in the management of hiv infection has been in pregnant women. prior to antiviral therapy the risk of hiv transmission from an infected mother to her newborn was approximately 25%-35%. the first major advance in this area came with studies giving zdv after the first trimester of pregnancy then intravenously during the delivery process and then after delivery to the newborn for six weeks. this treatment showed a reduction in the risk of transmission to less than 10%. although less data are available with more potent drug combinations clinical experience suggests that the risk of transmission may be reduced to less than 5%. current recommendations are to advise hiv-infected pregnant women regarding both the unknown side effects of antiviral therapy on the fetus and the promising clinical experience with potent therapy in preventing transmission. in the final analysis however pregnant women with hiv should be treated essentially the same as nonpregnant women with hiv. exceptions would be during the first trimester where therapy remains controversial and avoiding certain drugs that may cause greater concern for fetal toxicity such as efv. all hiv-infected pregnant women should be managed by an obstetrician with experience in dealing with hiv-infected women. maximal obstetric precautions to minimize transmission of the hiv virus such as avoiding scalp monitors and minimizing labor after rupture of the uterine membranes should be observed. in addition the potential use of an elective caesarean section (c-section) should be discussed particularly in those women without good viral control of their hiv infection where the risk of transmission may be increased. breastfeeding should be avoided if alternative nutrition for the infant is available since hiv transmission can occur by this route. updated guidelines for managing hiv-infected women are updated on a regular basis and can be found at <link>."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you've been going through this. nobody likes being ill! many different conditions could cause what you're describing. one likely candidate is food poisoning. certain types of food poisoning can cause bloody stool. these types often are accompanied by a high fever (over 101f). you should seek medical attention if your symptoms haven't cleared up within a few days. if this is indeed food poisoning it probably will go away on its own. meanwhile you need to be sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. assuming you're otherwise healthy i often recommend half-strength gatorade or a few glasses of water alternating with one glass of gatorade to help you stay hydrated and maintain electrolyte balance. one thing you don't want to do is take an over-the-counter anti-diarrhea preparation. if this does turn out to be food poisoning diarrhea is your body's way of getting rid of the toxin. so if things don't clear up within a few days see a health care professional before you think about treating yourself. feel better soon!"

    "Answer": "a dermatologist is your expert however many primary care clinicians are quite skilled at helping patients effectively manage their acne. while some over-the-counter acne meds are somewhat effective for certain types of mild acne they are not the definitive treatment. managing acne at home with the limited choices available to you can be frustrating and slow. medical providers have a wide range of treatment options. all you need to do is make an appointment and start the process. the goal of acne management is to limit those breakouts and minimize permanent scarring. get a medical professional on your team. i think you will be pleased by the outcome."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer the most likely cause would be an infection. either a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection. in your case it could be both. the urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis (irritation of your urethra) from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom. you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated."

    "Answer": "tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment."

    "Question": "what cut of steak is good for entertaining?",
    "Answer": "have you ever stood before the meat department and wondered what to do? eye of round london broil new york flank filet mignon … they all stand before you and it can be overwhelming. my cousin celia called me today. she was having that “what to do with the meat? ” dilemma. she was getting ready for a friend’s birthday party (this friend loves a great steak) but wasn’t sure which cut to pick for the crowd. if you’re having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon it can be a costly endeavor. my favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is london broil. it is not a fatty cut. the thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so it’s not chewy. when you are starting make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature — do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. if your meat is too cold when you start cooking it it will end up being dried out and chewy. i recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and don’t cook the steak too long (i recommend medium rare to medium at the most). you can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. i also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds slice it thin. this way you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. you still get your boost of protein and iron — and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! you can rub a london broil piece down with cracked pepper kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sautéed garlic. you can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. anyway you prepare it have fun with it and remember to keep your portion size in mind. a good visual for portion size is the size of your fist."

    "Question": "how are gallstones treated?",
    "Answer": "there are a number of ways to treat gallstones though most gallstones are silent. if silent gallstones are discovered in someone age 65 or older the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only 20%(or less assuming a life span of 75 years. in this instance it is reasonable not to treat the individual. among younger people no treatment also might be appropriate if they have serious lifethreatening diseases -- for example serious heart disease -- that are likely to shorten their life span. on the other hand in healthy young people treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime is higher. once symptoms begin treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. cholecystectomy cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures of the abdominal wall. laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. there also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. digestion is not affected and no change in diet is necessary. chronic diarrhea occurs in approximately 10% of patients. sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. in such situations there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well and cholecystectomy is necessary. it may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery but this may not always be possible. another way to remove gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone. sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. the cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ercp. after the sphincter is cut instruments may be passed through the endoscope and up into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. it also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include the general anesthesia perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum bleeding and pancreatitis. oral dissolution therapy it is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. the medication is a naturally-occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol (actigall urso). bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. the bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones. there are important limitations to the use of ursodiol: it is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. it works only for small gallstones less than 1 centimeter-1. 5 centimeter in diameter. it takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment. due to these limitations ursodiol generally is used only in people with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very high cholesterol content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. it also is reasonable to use ursodiol in people whose gallstones were likely to have formed because of a transient event for example rapid loss of weight since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (eswl) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones particularly those lodged in bile ducts. eswl generators produces shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. the shock waves shatter the gallstone and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically as in sphincterotomy."

    "Question": "how to clear congested nose suck/spit/swallow or blow? . i have a cold. my nose is clogged/runny depending on my head position (laying down one left opens my right nostal and vice versa) when i'm standing my nose becomes runny. i am using a decongestant. yesterday my left ear stated building up pressure. doctor said it's clear okay and not infected. i never thought about it but which is the better way to clear mucus from your nose due to a cold? or is it better just to let it run out or in?",
    "Answer": "the best way to clear mucous from your nose is to first liquefy (use saline nasal spray) and then gently blow your nose --- one side at a time by occluding the other nostril. you can do this repeatedly. perhaps the reason your ear is building pressure is because you are blowing too hard and air is going up your eustachian tubes to your middle ear space (the area behind your eardrum). unless you have a medical reason not to take a decongestant it may be okay to do this during the day only but it will increase the nasal drainage (night time decongestants can keep you awake and the post-nasal drainage will annoy you). if you want to dry up your nose an antihistamine can help. remember that colds only last a week so don't over-treat them. just wait it out. and. finally. it is okay to swallow post-nasal mucous. you can spit it out assuming you do that privately or in a tissue. hocking them out grosses out people."

    "Answer": "tubal ligation is considered \"permanent birth control. \" in your case it sounds like your fallopian tubes were cut and each end was sealed with heat (cautery). this method prevents an egg released by the ovary from meeting a sperm coming up the fallopian tube. the tubal ligation itself should be 100% effective against birth control. the other procedures you mentioned should not affect this at all. the novasure ablation (generic name: endometrial ablation ) is a procedure that uses heat to destroy the uterine lining. this procedure usually is done when a woman has abnormally heavy periods. it has nothing to do with birth control or pregnancy prevention. in the future i'd suggest you ask plenty of questions before having any type of surgical procedure done. it's crucial that you understand why your doctor is recommending the procedure what it's designed to treat what the potential side effects are and how long it will take you to recover. i hope this explanation sets your mind at ease! i had a tubal done 11 yrs ago and an ablation (freezing of the uterus) done 10 yrs ago and i haven't had a period since march 18 my back has been hurting since april 1 my feet have swollen a couple of times and i have minor abdominal cramps! my thoughts go to pregnancy but i feel stupid for even thinking it! my ob/gyn that performed my ablation told me to be sure i didn't want anymore children due to it killing the uterine lining! what are my chances of being pregnant? someone please help!"

    "Answer": "do you wonder whether disposable incontinence supplies are cheaper in the long run than reusable types? do you worry about putting all of those disposable items into the environment? if you are using incontinence products of any kind (pads adult diapers undergarments etc. ) you need to evaluate the types of products available based on what is most important to you — convenience or economy. there is no research to tell you which type of product is better for the skin. disposable products are convenient. purchased in quantity they can be always available when needed and require no labor other than putting them on. underwear and pads come in a wide range of sizes (waist extenders are available for some briefs) and they all are available in light medium and heavy protection levels. disposable incontinence products are more expensive than washable products in general and can cost anywhere from $200 to $400 per month depending on the amount of urine loss. this is a large expense for a person on a fixed income. some people are forced to make their own homemade pads from tissue paper towels and other materials. unfortunately medicare hmos and insurance companies don't tend to cover the cost of absorbent products and their disposal adds to environmental pollution. at the same time reusable products may not be as \"skin friendly\" as disposable ones. washable/reusable products are economical. studies have shown that some washable pads are equivalent in cost to 100 disposable pads of the same absorbency. washable underwear is available in basic styles in styles that mimic regular underwear and in styles that are elegant and indistinguishable from fine lingerie. if you are caring for someone who needs many underwear or pad changes daily the labor of washing these products is a factor to consider. incontinence garments (sometimes called adult diapers) that are washable usually have an outer layer of plastic rubber or synthetic material for protection and can be pulled up snapped on the side or open down the front. they are usually less expensive to use over time than disposable garments. because of their waterproof outer layer many women find washable garments uncomfortable because they don't \"breathe\". such women often prefer cotton underwear with a perineal pad in the crotch to collect urine leakage."

    "Question": "what's the difference between benign and malignant brain tumors?",
    "Answer": "benign brain tumors are noncancerous. malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain. they typically grow faster than benign tumors and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs it will spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually are not deeply rooted in brain tissue. this makes them easier to surgically remove assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. but even after they've been removed they can still come back though benign tumors are less likely than malignant ones to recur. although benign tumors in other parts of the body can cause problems they are not generally considered to be a major health problem or to be life threatening. but even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. brain tumors damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on the tissue under and around it as well as inside the skull."

    "Answer": "this caught my eye because i want to make people aware of why we do not give \"penicillin shots\" or antibiotics for colds. first antibiotics do not do anything for the common cold. antibiotics are only helpful if you have an infection that is caused by bacteria. there has been a lot of antibiotic \"misuse\" in the u. s. (people not taking antibiotics correctly over-prescribed saving them for a \"rainy day\") and that has caused a lot of problems including the fact that good old stand-by medications like penicillin are not working anymore because the bugs have become \"resistant. \" we are getting \"superbugs\" that our current antibiotics cannot touch -- and this is a dangerous and important health crisis. to avoid your problem in the future i would suggest proper symptom management and talking to your pharmacist about what products may be beneficial for you. this may include using nasal decongestants or saline irrigation systems to help cleanse your sinus cavity and avoid the possibilities of infection."

    "Answer": "plastic beads can be challenging to remove and that is speaking from a seasoned medical provider who has removed hundreds of them over the years. mostly from children who are not autistic. i have special instruments and can use directed light and magnification. i suspect that do not have these tools or the skills. unless you can gently irrigate out his ear with a stream of warm water (from a hand-held shower while both of you are in the bathtub or shower) then it would be wise not to attempt it. using any type of instrumentation may hurt him if it scratches the sensitive ear canal or may rupture his eardrum. as much as i know you hate to do this you will either need to take him to see his medical provider see an ent or go to the er. he can be restrained a bit or even slightly sedated but that bead needs to get out of there."

    "Answer": "ah what a great question. i think i have a great answer! when you have medications in your house you can't guarantee that they are stored in the correct conditions (i bet many folks still keep everything in their bathroom cabinet). medications in the home get exposed to heat cold moisture light etc. unlike when they are stored in a pharmacy in their original container. this can lead to the breaking down of the medication which could cause the medication to not work as well or you can have an actual reaction to the components of the medication breaking down (so to answer your question it is not safe). if you notice on your prescription bottles it should have an expiration date from 1 year from the date you got the medication filled. this is to protect you from the possible scenarios i described above. it's always better to be safe than sorry."

    "Answer": "the first step in the diagnosis of arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. the doctor will review the history of symptoms examine the joints for inflammation and deformity as well as ask questions about or examine other parts of the body for inflammation or signs of diseases that can affect other body areas. furthermore certain blood urine joint fluid and/or x-ray tests might be ordered. the diagnosis will be based on the pattern of symptoms the distribution of the inflamed joints and any blood and x-ray findings. several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. a doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist (see below). many forms of arthritis are more of an annoyance than serious. however millions of people suffer daily with pain and disability from arthritis or its complications. earlier and accurate diagnosis can help to prevent irreversible damage and disability. properly guided programs of exercise and rest medications physical therapy and surgery options can idealize long-term outcomes for those with arthritis. it should be noted that both before and especially after the diagnosis of arthritis communication with the treating doctor is essential for optimal health. this is important from the standpoint of the doctor so that he/she can be aware of the vagaries of the patient's symptoms as well as their tolerance of and acceptance of treatments. it is important from the standpoint of patients so that they can be assured that they have an understanding of the diagnosis and how the condition does and might affect them. it is also crucial for the safe use of medications."

    "Answer": "all of your choices are good ones. have you tried trail mix eg almonds dried fruit walnuts. nuts are full of nutrients but have protein as well so that just a few can be 'filling'. also a fiber based cereal with low fat milk is a snack that i often have when i have the munchies. here's a great article <link> also remember that sometimes if a person is stressed or tired he or she may think they are hungry but really it is a stress response. additionally if you are not drinking enough water during the day you may be thirsty and this may feel like hunger. in any case drinking 6-8 glasses of water is key to be healthy. glad you're doing so well with healthy eating. keep up the good work! it seems like this is a tough time for everyone but these are some of my go to snacks 1. plain greek yogurt: it's high in protein and really fills you up. i sweeten it with a little bit of fruit or 1 packet of splenda. 2. a bowl of steel cut oats withs almonds cranberries and honey. these take about 20 minutes to prepare but are well worth the wait. 3. no calorie sparkling water. i don't know why but it tastes good and somehow seems to help quell my hunger. 4. peanut butter or almond butter and banana sandwich on whole wheat. it's a great treat. if my belts a little tigt i'll only have half a sandwich. make sure you measrue your peanut butter serving (1 to 2 tablespoons) 5. 2 slices center cut bacon and apple slices. i don't eat this alot because of the saturated fat in bacon but it definitely fills you up. 6. trail mix: almonds pecans raisins with mini-chocolate chips be sure to measure your serving and pair with some raw veggies to fill it out 7. sliced apple with 1-2 tablespoons of peanut or almond butter 8. string cheese almonds and a serving of fruit 9. my all time favorite is paleo granola. it's very high in calories so you have to keep your servings small but it's delicious. i'll also add a cut up banana to it as well. the recipe below makes 14 servings which comes out to about 300 calories/serving ingredients almonds walnuts and pecans 2 cup ground sunflower seeds without salt 1 cup hulled pumpkin seeds 1 cup coconut flake unsweetened 3 oz canola oil 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup vanilla extract 2 tsp cinnamon ground 1 tsp raisins or dried cranberries 1/4 cup packed directions: 1. grind nuts and seeds and add to a large bowl 2. spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray 3. add 1/4 of cup canola oil and 1/4 of cup honey to small pan and heat 4. add vanilla extract and cinnamon to pan and bring mixture to boil. 5. remove from heat and pour over nuts and seed mixture in bowl 6. mix well and pour onto cookie sheet 7. bake in oven for 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees (watch closely) 8. take out of oven add coconut flakes and dried fruit. sometimes i'll also add some chocolate to the recipe as well. friends have told me they like it better with 1/3 cup of oil and honey. but that will increase the calories. this is not an original recipe but one i got of the internet and modified to suit my taste. late night snacking is difficult for many people. before having a snack i always suggest that you first analyze whether you’re actually hungry or just eating out of boredom. there’s nothing wrong with late night eating as long as it’s a mindful deliberate snack instead of mindless eating. try not to eat too much food before you go to bed. your last full meal of the day should be no less than 2 hours before you go to sleep. eating too much before going to bed may cause indigestion acid reflux or could lead to insomnia and trouble sleeping. make sure that if you do snack that you’re only eating at most between 100 to 300 calories shortly before going to bed. for many people late night snacks often tend to not be very healthy. be sure to keep healthy alternatives readily accessible so that you can make the right choices. check out this article for some great low calorie snack ideas from a dietitian: <link>. hi and thanks so much for your question. sounds like you're a nocturnal eater like so many people out there. here are some thoughts and recommendations: look beyond your eating: what time are you going to bed each night? the later you stay up the more likely you are to be wandering into the kitchen and munching away. try to get to bed no later than 11 and get a full 7-8 hours of sleep each night. it really helps. are you doing things at night that cue you to eat like watching tv and then being enticed by the ads? you have to rein in all cues to eat. these trigger you to knee jerk into your default bad habits. watch out for stress at night as stress overeating is yet another cue. eating throughout the day: try to eat every 3-4 hours starting with breakfast. that means you'll need to have a satisfying mid-afternoon snack like a protein smoothie (fresh or frozen fruit 1-2 scoops of protein powder water/skim milk) or some combo of protein and fiber like peanut butter and apple slices or hummus and carrots. if you mind that mid-afternoon snack this helps control your dinner portions. this is important because nocturnal eating can happen when you come home way to hungry and/or when you eat too much refined sugar and fat at dinner further stimulating your appetite for more food. lean protein serving of grain like quinoa and veggies that you like really help. night eating: if you're truly feeling some hunger a nifty trick is to drink warm water--- like tea--- along with a tsp of some nut butter like peanut or almond butter. it's a great balance of fat sugar and carb. finally stay away from the kitchen after dinner when at all possible. get to the other side of the house and keep your bedroom sacrosanct with no food allowed. good luck! dr peeke i think cottage cheese tastes so gross! so i feel your pain. i like dips like hummus and guacamole which you can eat with veggies like carrots or celery or cucumber. you can buy hummus made with garlic or red peppers it tastes really good! i've also been eating a lot of almonds lately for snacks. there are some almonds at the store that are flavored with wasabi that are amazing. this slideshow has a bunch more ideas for low calorie snacks: <link>"

    "Answer": "you can do lunges and stair climbing for your legs. no external resistance just your own body weight. if you have someone to hold you by the legs you can do back extensions by lying on your belly with your torso off the bed and lift your back up. you can also just do this lying on the floor then you won't need anyone to hold you. for lats you can lie down on the floor bring your arms up in front of you elbows on the floor and press down trying to lift your torso off the floor. that will work lats. you can also do chair dips they will work your lats a little. it can be more difficult to exercise while traveling but it’s certainly still attainable. here are some ideas and suggestions for ways that you can get exercise while traveling: • there are plenty of different body weight exercises calisthenics or stretches that you can do in your hotel room. here’s a great list of exercises that don’t require equipment: <link> • many hotels have onsite fitness rooms or swimming pools that you may have access to • try to find nearby parks or ways to get involved in recreational activities outdoors • go for a walk or run outside or do stair climbing • resistance bands require little space so they can be packed easily and be used in a hotel room • if you’re bringing a laptop you can bring an exercise dvd to use in your hotel room. if you don’t own an exercise video you can search for free ones to watch online be unconventional and think outside of the box if necessary. if it’s still a challenge for you to do exercise while traveling make it a point to be more diligent by doing exercise on days where you have more control of your environment or try to plan your exercise around travel as best as possible."

    "Answer": "once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone. a combination of glycolic aha and retinoid-based products along with a traditional topical skin care regimen for skin brightening will work. hydroquinone-based products work well. however there are other alternatives such as bearberry extract kojic acid licorice extract and niacin. these compounds will work toward brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone. the key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo- or hyperpigmentation."

    "Question": "what is polymerase chain reaction?",
    "Answer": "polymerase chain reaction is a method to analyze a short sequence of dna (or rna) even in samples containing only minute quantities of dna or rna. pcr is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of dna or rna. previously amplification of dna involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria and took weeks. but now with pcr done in test tubes it takes only a few hours. pcr is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the dna. moreover pcr uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying dna: two \"primers\" short single-stranded dna sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the dna stretch to be copied. an enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of dna reading its code and assembling a copy. a pile of dna building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."

' remember that some people who get the flu may not have symptoms and can spread the virus too. good hand washing hygiene and getting the flu vaccine can help prevent getting the flu. you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick as well as while you are sick. most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. some people especially young children and people with weakened immune systems might be able to infect others for an even longer time. typically during the first 72 hours whenever a fever is present or before antibiotics are administered. 2 weeks 2 days"

    "Answer": "i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "glycolic acid is a chemical that's designed to make your skin cells less sticky so that they slough off. glycolic acid in its pure form when its not buffered its a strong acid and if you put it on the skin and don't neutralize it it will keep working and eventually burn your skin as a chemical burn. over-the-counter glycolic acid are buffered. they are somewhat neutralized so that they are less likely to create a chemical or too strong a chemical reaction in your skin. so the ones that you get from your doctor would be stronger. the doctor will watch the treatment and then neutralize it at the appropriate time for you to have the desired benefit. if you are going to do one from over-the-counter it has to be a milder form of it in order to have that benefit without the risk."

    "Question": "both my husband and i have been out of work for years. we own too much to get medicaid. . how are we supposed to get health insurance so that we don't have to pay the $984 fine? that's $984 per person. the federal government told me we could use \"low cost clinics \" but that's not health insurance so we'll still be responsible for this penalty. so what's the point of this law? how can they make people who are out of work pay even more money that they don't have?",
    "Answer": "the fine is either $95 per person/$285 for a family (not $984) or 1% of your annual household income whichever is greater. even if you haven't qualified for medicaid before you might now. the law expands the guidelines making it possible for a couple earning up to roughly $21 000 annually to get medicaid coverage. of course many states aren't expanding the program. if you live in one that is not you'll still want to shop on the marketplace for insurance because you'll likely qualify for a substantial subsidy to lower the cost of coverage. if medicaid isn't an option and you can't find a plan that costs you less than 8% of your income you won't be penalized for not having insurance."

    "Question": "how do fat absorption inhibitors work? will i really have anal leakage?",
    "Answer": "this is the product alli or orlistat that's available over-the-counter and is still available as prescription known as xenical. what they do is it actually binds to fat that's in fatty foods and it absorbs it and makes it bind together so when you actually have a bowel movement it's passed through that way. so it's never really absorbed in the body the fat triazole 9:38 it's like a sponge it soaks it up. it's very safe. it is effective. the over-the-counter version is actually half of the dose of the prescription so therefore there are less treatment effects such as abdominal pain. a lot of people say that they see oil or fatty stools that's absolutely fine that's actually the medication working. what it does is it tries to train you to eat better. the alli website has a lot of great examples of menus. they even have a book that will tell you when you go to places like mcdonald's or burger king what you can and cannot eat. if you happened to have a really fatty meal you're going to know because you probably will be in the bathroom for a little bit longer than what you expected but once again it's training you to eat healthier. so they are really good product and once again all their literature is great because they advise you that you should be doing things like exercising and drinking more water using things like a pedometer tracking your progress and then also having realistic expectations. you're not going to lose 20 pounds in one month that's not really a good goal to have. gradual weight loss is the way to go and if you end up losing two or three pounds per month that's great and plus too you're changing your lifestyle. a lot of pharmacists have gotten a lot of questions about this product since it was launched in 2007 and it really has been a great way for pharmacists to get to know their patients better. come and ask us for the medication experts we're happy to help you."

    "Answer": "most cases of hypothyroidism in the united states are caused by hashimoto's thyroiditis which cannot be prevented. although you cannot prevent hypothyroidism you can watch for signs of the disease so it can be treated promptly. some people who are at high risk of having hypothyroidism but do not have symptoms can be tested to see whether they have mild or subclinical hypothyroidism. expert groups differ in their recommendations for screening: the american thyroid association recommends that all adults be tested beginning at age 35 and continuing every 5 years. 7 older adults especially women older than 60 those with a family history of hypothyroidism and those with addison's disease rheumatoid arthritis pernicious anemia and type 1 diabetes should also be tested according to these recommendations. the u. s. preventive services task force makes no recommendation for or against thyroid screening for people who do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism. its statement indicates there is not enough evidence to support screening. 8 another panel of experts from several medical specialties recommends against widespread screening. 4 but these health professionals say that if you are high risk you may want to be screened. those at high risk include women older than age 60 and people who have type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases. 4 talk to your doctor about whether you should be screened. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "should people get \"regular\" ct scans (or some other head scan) to check for tumors in the brain (before its too late). i just feel that diagnosing/finding tumors early in the process of formation is the best way to prevent serious damage and i understand that tumor growth would exhibit certain symptoms but it is possible that people under high stress/anxiety may think its just because of their lifestyle when in fact there may be a more serious underlying issue. also tumor growth in brain regions that control personality (ie. how outgoing you are being socially awkward etc) may be harder to call a symptom",
    "Answer": "the amount of radiation involved in a ct scan would not justify the use as a screening test for the general population. it would probably cause more cancer than it would find. there are very specific symptoms and signs that would indicate an intracranial problem so it would be best to screen these patients first with a neurological exam rather than just recommending that all people get a brain ct scan. just like a pap smear or mammogram."

    "Answer": "i'm not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this? my friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds. i was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight. the first thing i did was not allow her to make her own plate. she thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate. a sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein (1 sausage) and a glass of orange juice. or since you're young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal that's healthy and without all that sugar. an ex could be kashi or something like raisin bran. the second thing i did was teach her about nutrition. her mom is 300+ pounds so i knew there was no one there who knew either. if you ball your hand into a fist that's the size of your stomach. that's how much food can actually fit. anymore than that then you're stretching your stomach out. the more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size it's supposed to be. third which should probably be first but i wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise. you have to exercise. skipping at school or pe isn't enough. i walked with her everyday for 30 minutes. she didn't think she could do it but i stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her. we were even able to start doing it twice a day. hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging. fourth you have to drink tons of water. sometimes your body might feel like it's hungry when you're actually thirsty. a good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day. to help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cups/glasses and that's how you can keep track. fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods. i made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal. her snacks were fruit. also a good time to say eat 5-7 small meals everyday and when i say small i mean the size of your fist small."

    "Question": "if i am at high risk for colon cancer but not yet 50 why won't doctors bill a colonoscopy as routine? . my brother-in-law was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at 46 years old. he died last september. . my husband is 48 and wants to get a colonoscopy but the procedure is not being billed as \"routine\" so we would have to meet our entire deductible before insurance pays anything. . what are our options?",
    "Answer": "push the insurance company. do not take \"no\" as the first answer and ask to talk to the medical director or better yet have your physician request an exemption to the rule. a friend of mine wanted a colonoscopy early because her grandmother had colon cancer. they refused at first only offering a sigmoidoscopy (a cheaper and less- thorough exam). they finally okayed the colonoscopy and a pre-cancerous lesion was found in a place where the sigmoidoscopy would not have discovered. had she waited several more years like the insurance company wanted she would have definitely had colon cancer by that time. fight 'em!"

    "Answer": "it sounds like you've been able to receive low-cost care through a community based health clinic. if you're income is low enough you'll likely be exempt from a tax penalty if you choose not to buy insurance. anyone who can't find a plan costing less than 8% of their annual income needn't buy coverage. but you'd do yourself a favor by going online to healthcare. gov or talking with someone at the clinic about your insurance options just to check out what's available to you. there's a very good chance you'll qualify for either a subsidy to help you buy affordable insurance or for medicaid if your income is low enough and you live in a state expanding its program."

    "Question": "i want larger-looking lips. should i go with a lip plumper or filler?",
    "Answer": "for a temporary change the obvious answer is to use a commercial lip plumper and see how it goes. more and more cosmetics companies are bringing out lip plumpers some already tinted some not. lip plumpers can be surprisingly effective; in a few cases users not only get strikingly fuller lips but the results last up to eight hours as well. to be honest though the effects of most lip plumpers rarely last more than an hour especially if users eat or drink. most lip plumpers use an irritant such as cinnamon wintergreen or ginger that causes enough of a reaction to make the lips swell and look temporarily fuller. some of them especially those with higher concentrations of cinnamon and wintergreen can really make the lips burn sometimes quite painfully. and that burning sensation applies not only to the woman who used a plumper on her lips but to anybody she kisses as well. if your significant other is allergic i’d stay away from these plumpers; obviously people with sensitive skin should also avoid them because they may get a whole lot more than they bargained for. never use lip plumpers on cracked lips or on cold sores because the pain can be excruciating. less irritating plumpers are those with retinol or oligopeptides both of which stimulate collagen production. the advantage to these plumpers is that with repeated use lips will not only look fuller but smoother and less wrinkled. a warning: retinol increases sun sensitivity. i recommend that lip plumpers with retinol be used only at night. for a longer-lasting look you’d have to go with fillers usually hyaluronic acid fillers; my two favorites are prevelle silk and juvederm. in my experience prevelle silk gives a more subtle look while juvederm lasts longer. these lip fillers cost $750- $1000 and last three to four months. some people just want to define their lips so they get a tiny amount of filler injected all around the lip border; their lips stand out more but without added volume. this technique is especially popular with women over forty because the lip border becomes less distinct with age. i would never ever recommend more permanent procedures such as silicone injections or lip implants. with silicone injections problems such as lumps and irregular or asymmetrical lips are actually pretty common and lip implants frequently look artificial. think before you get lip fillers. if you want to see how you would look with fuller lips then try lip plumpers first and see if you like the way you look. when buying a lip plumper or any other beauty product try to read and decipher the ingredients contained in the product in order to see how the plumping or moisturising will occur. also remember that most lip plumpers will eventually result in drying of the lips as most of the plumping ingredients act as an irritant to the lips therefore resulting in the plumping. these products typically work by irritating the thin delicate skin of the lips with ingredients like menthol or camphor. this makes the lips swell slightly which may also diminish the appearance of fine lines in that area. lip filler procedures provide immediate results that should last for up to six months after which time you may need a top-up to maintain the volume. initially there will be some swelling and sometimes bruising in the lip area from the injections. this should quickly subside to reveal your full and plump lips. some of the most common side effects of collagen lip injections are instances where lips swell or bruise after treatment. there can also be bruising around the sides of the mouth depending on the material that is used and the method of injection as well as how the body handles the foreign material. some patients can be allergic to some aspects of collagen lip injections and that can cause excessive swelling or related side effects it’s generally not a good idea to ignore the warning signs of complications from this process which could cause a patient long-term harm. consult a doctor before selecting one of these treatments to talk about lip injections or lip plumpers and what kinds of potential side effects may result."

    "Question": "can herbal eye drops lighten the color of your eyes? if not then what will besides contacts? . my eyes are too dark. when i look in the mirror at my eyes i see a dark brown but i want to make my pupil lighter.",
    "Answer": "when you look at your eyes in the mirror you see three basic colors: the white of your eyeball the colored part of the iris and the black of the pupil. let's look at these in a little more detail. everyone's eyeball is white. it's just how they're made. everyone's pupil is black because the pupil is actually an opening that allows light to go inside the eyeball. the pupil looks black because there's no light inside the eye to illuminate it. if there were the pupil might look bright white or even orange as if it were glowing. wouldn't that be cool? the iris is the colored part of the eyeball. the iris is not a muscle but it does expand and contract to control the size of your pupil (and by extension how much light gets inside your eye). the color of your iris is genetically determined. genetics is complex business so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say you can't use any product to lighten darken or otherwise change the color of your iris. the color is \"hard-coded\" into your dna. if you are unhappy with the color of your eyes the only way to change it is with contact lenses. that said i would tell you not to obsess over your eye color. there's no such thing as \"too dark\" or \"too light. \" beauty is in the eye of the beholder (pun intended). try to love your eye color because it is absolutely unique in the universe. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "over-the-counter lip plumpers use ingredients that increase blood flow to the lips like cinnamon and wintergreen. when blood flow is enhanced the lips tend to get mild swelling and increase in redness. sometimes these lip plumping ingredients can cause a sensation of tingling. here is a link to an article that has lots of info about lip plumpers. <link> take care"

    "Answer": "good nutrition is important for strong bones and muscles. for people with lupus bone health is a particular concern. that’s because medications used to treat it can increase the risk for osteoporosis a condition in which the bones become less dense and break easily. eating foods high in calcium and vitamin d is important for bone health. when buying dairy products choose ones that are either low-fat or fat-free. good choices include: 1% or skim milk low-fat low-sodium yogurt low-fat cheese if you cannot drink milk good alternatives include: lactose-free milk soy milk almond milk juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin d dark green vegetables are another source of calcium. if you don’t get enough calcium in your diet your doctor will probably recommend a calcium supplement."

    "Answer": "i'm glad you got that spot on your hand frozen. it's better to get those suspicious lesions off before they can turn into something serious. regarding your blister. don't \"drain\" it. don't pop it. leave it alone. the clear liquid you see coming out is a sign of the body trying to heal itself. that liquid contains proteins and cells of other types the body needs to repair the damage caused by freezing the skin. if you continue to drain off that fluid your body will have a more difficult time repairing itself. a better idea is to apply some antibiotic ointment and apply an adhesive bandage. then leave the wound alone for several days. keep it dry as much as possible. when showering either leave the bandage in place or remove it but do not scrub the wound. simply allow water to flow over it. then re-apply the bandage. after about 5 days of being left alone you should notice a scab or some other \"dry\" type of healing going on. at that point you can leave the bandage off. and don't pick the scab. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "\"white strips\" are not a clinical sign of strep so no. this is not typical. if you had a confirming lab test (rapid strep or culture) then your diagnosis was most likely accurate and you will be feeling better soon (assuming you are on the correct antibiotic). if you were diagnosed clinically --- just by a visual examination -- then there is a 50/50 chance that your diagnosis was incorrect and you do not have strep but rather a viral infection. viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics and one virus in particular --- the one that causes mono can actually become worse when you are taking antibiotics."

    "Question": "what happens to someone when they get inguinal hernia?",
    "Answer": "inguinal hernias typically flatten or disappear when they are pushed gently back into place or when you lie down. over time hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. if you can't push your hernia back into your belly it is incarcerated. a hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. this is not necessarily an emergency. but if a loop of the intestine is trapped very tightly in the hernia the blood supply to that part of the intestine can be cut off ( strangulated ) causing tissue to die. in a man if tissue is trapped the testicle and its blood vessels can also be damaged. a strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. in adults a hernia that can be pushed back into the abdomen can be surgically repaired at a convenient time. this is because incarceration is rare in adults. a hernia that cannot be pushed back can be repaired when surgery is convenient unless you have increased pain redness of the overlying skin fever nausea and vomiting or abdominal bloating. if any of these symptoms occur the hernia may need to be fixed sooner. inguinal hernias can come back after surgical repair. but in women it is rare for inguinal hernias to recur. fertility is usually not affected by an inguinal hernia or hernia surgery. but in males there is a chance that surgery or an incarcerated hernia can cause injury to the vas deferens the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra. it is not yet known how often or to what degree this affects a man's ability to father a child. in rare cases surgery or an incarcerated hernia may injure the blood vessels that supply one or both testicles with blood which may cause the affected testicle to shrink. hernias in children infants or children with an inguinal hernia need to have surgery as soon as possible because of the increased risk that a part of the intestine will become trapped and blood supply will be cut off leading to tissue death. incarceration when intestinal or abdominal tissue fills up the sac of a hernia occurs in about 2 or 3 out of 10 infants younger than 6 months who have hernias. most incarcerated hernias occur before the infant is 1 year old. 1 female infants face a higher risk of incarceration. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "if you're worried about phn (postherpetic neuralgia) don't despair. there are medications that can cut your risks of getting the condition. there are three antiviral drugs used: famvir valtrex and zovirax. these medications need to be started within two to three days of the onset of shingles. \"if you look at the clinical trials with any of these drugs in people over 50 \" says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y \"they cut the rate of pain at six months in half. that's a very significant improvement. \" they are also very safe and have few side effects he says. but who needs the drugs? dworkin says there's not a clear consensus yet. there are some obvious cases. \"i think everyone would agree that someone who is over 50 and has severe symptoms should get preventative treatment \" he tells webmd. but for younger people or those with fewer risk factors the course is less clear. \"some people think that everyone who gets shingles should get preventative treatment with antiviral medicines \" he says \"because the medicines are so safe and have such few side effects. \"\" others argue that preventative treatment should only be given to those at greater risk. the main reason for this dworkin says is cost. \"a full course of treatment could cost anywhere between $100 and $160 \" he says. \"that can add up and insurance companies might not want to pay if the risks are very very low. \"\""

    "Question": "how do you get a chiled to eat healthy during the preoperational stage by using preoperational thought? . what are some characteristics of preoperational thinking that i can use with my child to get her to eat more healthy?",
    "Answer": "the pre-operational stage between ages of 2 and 6 can be tough as there is a lot going on both physical and cognitively. children have slowed growth (and appetite) so their eating is erratic this is also the time that food neophobia (fear of new foods) peaks increasing picky eating. here are some things parents can to do encourage healthy eating: set structure at meals. that means eating regular meals and 1-2 snacks between in a focused way (preferably the kitchen table). children who graze on snacks may eat poor at mealtime because they have small bellies. follow the ellyn satter division of responsibility of feeding where parents decide the what when and where of feeding and children decide the whether and how much of eating. pressuring children to eat actually makes them eat less so allow your child to take the lead and you'll be surprised how much better they do over time. battles make mealtime a negative and eating suffers. eat together and model healthy eating habits. children learn by watching others eat -- encourage touching food or smelling it to get a child comfortable with new items. have children help with meal preparation and get them involved as much as possible. hands on leaning is always best at this stage as telling a young child a food is \"healthy \" translates to \"it must taste bad. \" always tell them it tastes good! build on foods the already accept. so if they like a certain sauce try a healthy item in that familiar sauce. if they like a certain dip try a new veggie with it. if they like breaded chicken try breaded veggies like zucchini. make sure there is always something at the table your child likes so they aren't overwhelmed with new food. they will be more likely to try something if they feel there is safe food there. it is not that tough to meet a child's nutritional needs at this stage. remember that a varied fruit intake can make up for low veggie intake. 2-5 year old's only need 2-3 ounces of protein per day. and always look at their eating over a week and not one day. it usually evens out. the good news is after 6 children become more open to food especially if mealtime has been a positive experience with them. never label them as picky and always have an expectant attitude when it comes to eating. good luck!"

    "Question": "can a person go off high blood pressure medication if he looses weight or is this a lifetime medication once started?",
    "Answer": "when a person becomes overweight they make it harder for their heart to function. think about it: every pound of extra fat requires extra blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells. as your heart works extra-hard to pump blood through possibly miles of extra blood vessels it can cause high blood pressure. when a person who is overweight loses weight the opposite effect can occur. the fat and extra miles of blood vessels have gone away with the weight loss so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. this can lower blood pressure. so yes if a person is overweight and takes high blood pressure medication they may be able to get themselves off the meds by losing weight. i say \"may\" because factors other than extra weight may be causing the individual's hypertension problems. if you are overweight and taking medication for high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you begin a weight loss program. that way your healthcare provider can monitor your progress and adjust your medications as you lose weight. no one should ever stop taking a medication like one for high blood pressure on their own. that definitely could have bad consequences. wishing you well!"

    "Question": "my medications aren't working for mood stability but my doctor doesn't want to change anything. what should i do? . i have been on and off psych medications for almost eight years now (i started to be medicated for major depression when i was 13 then they started treating me for bipolar 2/bpd along with anxiety ptsd and psychotic episodes). along with the constant medication shifts until my current psychiatrist refuses to change my medication i was hospitalized in a state mental facility went through ect treatments and psychotherapy. i don't know what to do. please help.",
    "Answer": "oh my it sounds as if you're having a very rough time of things. first off i want to tell you that you are not alone. i also suffer from bipolar disorder and my 9 year old was diagnosed with it as well as being diagnosed with ied. i understand much of what you're going through. i'm a bit surprised you were being treated at such a young age (since they don't recommend it) but considering your diagnosis it sounds like the benefits outweighed the risks. the trouble with psyche meds is that eventually they don't work as effectively or at all. it could be that one med isn't effective or the combination of a few of those you take isn't working. obviously you've spoken to your doctor about he hasn't been willing to make a change. have you explained why you want the change that the meds are no longer as effective? have you been assertive? some doctors act as though you don't know as much as they do. but it's your body and your mind. you know if you don't feel right he doesn't. also has he ever given you a reason as to why he doesn't want to change your meds? you deserve an explanation that makes sense. if you have already gone through all this and he's still not willing to discuss changing your meds i suggest finding another doctor who suits you and your needs better. and don't feel guilty about the change. you deserve a doctor that you're comfortable with that will listen to your needs and concerns. good luck and remember you're not alone in your struggles with mental illness. <positive_smiley>"

    "Question": "how can i help research on epilepsy?",
    "Answer": "there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders."

    "Question": "i've had white noise (with corresponding hearing loss) in my left ear for 2 months. what causes it and can it be fixed. i have had an mri -- negative for tumor ms or anything else that might be causing it.",
    "Answer": "hearing loss would generally be caused by a problem with the ear or a problem with transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. it sounds like you have had tests to detect any brain or nerve problem. i would have to assume at this point you have also seen an ent (ear nose and throat) doctor to have your ear thoroughly examined. sometimes it can be tough to identify the cause of ringing in the ears or white noise-type sounds like you describe with associated hearing loss. the only recommendation i can offer at this point is to work closely with an ent doctor to keep searching for what might be causing it as the list of possibilities is lengthy. based on your symptoms i am not able to tell what might be going on. i am sure you have done quite a bit of research on your own at this point but a search on \"hearing loss\" on webmd will bring up a host of useful information. to get started here's information on the most common causes of hearing loss. did any doctor call it \"tinnitus? \" if that's what it is here are some reasons why you might have it that i found. not sure though that this is helpful if you do not have tinnitus. \"the most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging (presbycusis) but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises (acoustic trauma). tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. other possible causes of tinnitus include: a buildup of earwax. medicines especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. ear infections or eardrum rupture. dental or other problems affecting the mouth such as temporomandibular (tm) problems. injuries such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. a rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position such as when bicycle riding. blood flow (vascular) problems such as carotid atherosclerosis av malformations and high blood pressure (hypertension). nerve problems (neurologic disorders) such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. other diseases. these may include: acoustic neuroma. anemia. labyrinthitis. meniere's disease. otosclerosis. thyroid disease. most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. you may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms does not get better or go away or is in only one ear. there may not be a cure for tinnitus but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. i also found this article on home treatments: <link>"

    "Answer": "if your doctor put you on a low-dose aspirin regimen i would urge you not to discontinue it without your doctor's approval. your health care provider wouldn't put you on an aspirin regimen unless he or she believed you needed it. if you're experiencing undesirable side effects like the bruising and bleeding issues please make an appointment to discuss these with your health care provider because he or she needs to know that this is happening. your doctor may want to take you off aspirin lower the dose or put you on a different medication altogether. if on the other hand you started taking daily aspirin on your own because you've read it might be good for you or help prevent a heart attack or something then you probably are ok to stop. going to an every-other-day regimen is a great way to taper off the dose. do that for a week then go to every second day for a week and so on until you're down to once a week. at that point you can stop. i want to make a point that no one should self-medicate for heart concerns with aspirin whether low-dose or regular strength. blood thinning should be done only under the supervision of a health care provider. also when a person is on an aspirin regimen he or she should be aware of over-the-counter supplements such as fish oil and vitamin e that also have blood-thinning properties. taking too many (or too much) of these products can cause the bleeding and bruising problems you describe. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "i think what you may have read is its better to get nutrients from food because of the other health benefits such as fiber and antioxidants. it's true that you will likely absorb more from food because the nutrients are not provided in one dose like a multivitamin. for example calcium is better absorbed when giving through out the day instead of one big dose. it would be impossible to put together a drink with food that had 100% daily value of vitamins and minerals like a multivitamin has. instead work to get the recommended amount of food in your daily diet. smoothies with fruits vegetables and yogurt can help you meet your produce goal (5 or more daily). to figure out your needs based on your indiviual needs go to choosemyplate. gov"

    "Answer": "it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type 2 diabetes. that's because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs. there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well. after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type 2 diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity. we don't fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it. the answer is likely in the genetics but we don't know which genes confer protection or susceptibility. similarly some thin people develop type 2 diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance. again the answer is in the genes but we don't know which genes."

    "Answer": "what is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you. let me give you some background information. the test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone. it has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone. think of it as a bill collector. if you don't respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond. the tsh is the bill collector and if your thyroid \"isn't paying the bills\" aka isn't producing enough thyroid hormone (t4); tsh levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary (master) gland decides its a hopeless cause and tsh production decreases or stops. the reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their tsh is too high. they don't realize the tsh is not actually the thyroid hormone (which is the hormone that will be low in this case). i just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results. some providers don't realize that if your tsh is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms. thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your tsh down to the lower ranges of normal (0. 7 -2 approximately). . the range used to be 0. 5 to 5 for tsh. the national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 0. 3 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within \"normal range\". i prefer to keep my tsh around 1 because that's when i feel normal. \" everybody is different so that may not work for you. what it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result; if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor. do some research write down questions/symptoms when you think of them and talk to your pcp about it. if you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion."

    "Question": "what is considered preexisting condition by travel insurance companies. in april fractured l1 vertebra. in july booked trip as felt fine. in august fractured l2 l3 and l4 vertebrae. doctors insisted i cancel trip. insurance company claiming preexisting condition due to l1 fracture. i don't think so as l1 had healed and i had no way of knowing i'd do something stupid and cause fractures to addi\\titional vetebrae.",
    "Answer": "travel insurance operates under different regulations than other health insurance. however a pre-existing health condition is a condition that you previously had and were treated for. the fact that it's now healed is irrelevant in the insurer's eyes. from your description it sounds like you did fracture your l1 vertebrae prior to applying for coverage. if that's accurate then you do in fact have a pre-existing condition and assuming travel insurers are allowed to consider that when you apply for coverage (insurers of major medical health plans cannot) the insurer could use that to deny you coverage or charge you more for a policy."

    "Question": "23 yr old non smoker w/ swollen enlarged tonsil hard to swallow but tests showed it isn't strep or mono so what is it? . i went to see a doctor today but his diagnosis (acute pharyngitis) does not feel right. about 3 wks ago i was diagnosed with strep throat. my lymph nodes were very swollen and tender to the touch. i had a fever throat was sore and there were white spots on my tonsils. no swab test. i was on antibiotics for 5 days (z-pak and prednisone) which helped. my sore throat came back over a week ago. i then noticed a little red bump on my left tonsil that got bigger and now my sore throat is worse! help!",
    "Answer": "as you know i cannot \"see\" your throat and examine you over the internet and unfortunately your description is really not specific enough for me to even guess. a medical provider must see these things first-hand. a mono test taken early in the course of an illness may not be very accurate so your medical provider should consider doing an ebv titer (a very sensitive mono test) if the clinical findings warrant it. a z-pack is not the treatment of choic for strep so perhaps a repeat strep culture is indicated as well (not the rapid strep test) and while you are at it a cbc (complete blood count) would be helpful information. the vast majority of sore throats are viral but sometimes this virus is mono so this diagnosis needs to be revisited."

    "Answer": "ouch! that must be uncomfortable! i suggest you get this checked out by your primary care physician or other healthcare provider as soon as possible. what you're experiencing clearly isn't normal and you don't want to take any chances with your reproductive health. if you experience any of the following symptoms seek immediate medical attention because these are the signs of testicular torsion : sudden severe pain of the testicles/scrotum (sack) enlargement of a testicle swelling of the scrotum (sack) tenderness of one or both testicles with luck your primary care provider can tell you what's going on and treat it if necessary. please don't feel embarrassed to speak with a medical professional about this issue. trust me we deal with situations like this all the time in a respectful way. we want to make sure you get the care you deserve. best wishes!"

    "Question": "what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner? what are the risks if he is infected? . hello . i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear. however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms. i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him? i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about? . thank you",
    "Answer": "i recently went to my gynecologist and well i was told that i had abnormal cells on the cervix and that hpv caused it. my doctor said that everybody has hpv if you had sex at least once. that is why you need to have that pap-smear done every year to detect cancer cells which are caused by this hpv virus (in between other things). so needless to say that you cannot avoid transmitting it to him since he already has it unless he has never had sex. don't quote me. i read about it and it enforces what my doctor said according to the info i got however educated and uneducated people will have different discussions about this. the best thing is to go see your own personal doctor and ask them these questions. good luck <positive_smiley>"

    "Question": "how do you heal small cuts near the vaginal opening anus? . last friday my partner and i were having sex and i felt a little discomfort in the area between my anus and vaginal opening. i thought it was from his pubic hair but two days later it noticed a stinging sensation when i urinated. i thought it was the usual soreness that i experience after sex with my partner but that usually goes away after two days. it's now thursday 12/20/12 and it still hasn't healed. is there anything i can use to help this heal faster?",
    "Answer": "these may be tiny fissures or tears but this is just a blind guess since i cannot see it. fissures should heal in a week or so if you keep the area very clean and dry (be careful when you towel dry it would be better to \"pat dry\" this area). use a topical antibiotic ointment and check the area periodically with a mirror to make sure it is not getting infected. make sure that your underwear is not irritating this sensitive area. wear more breathable cotton ones for now. should this area fail to heal or if you think it is getting worse you will need to see a medical provider. hi just think sea salt this will help clean and heal your tears do this twice a day in a warm bath if possible till there have healed but try and keep of sex till then if it happens again make sure your using lots of lubrication sex oils. but till then keep it clean and dry wear cotton knickers or just go commando. hope this helps you. good luck from personal experience (this may or may not be the same thing you're dealing with). i went to the dr for the same thing. apparently people have the staph bacteria all over their body all the time and usually you're fine but sometimes the bacteria will get balsy or get into tiny openings in the skin and cause what feels like little cuts. i was getting them inside my nose for not apparent reason and nothing gets rid of it and then it happened in the same place you're talking about. i was prescribed mupirocin and it went away in about 3 days."

    "Answer": "no. antibiotics play no role in treating the common cold. antibiotics are effective only against illnesses caused by bacteria and colds are caused by viruses. not only do antibiotics not help but they can rarely also cause severe allergic reactions that can sometimes be fatal. furthermore using antibiotics when they are not necessary has led to the growth of several strains of common bacteria that have become resistant to certain antibiotics. for these and other reasons it is important to limit the use of antibiotics to situations in which they are medically indicated. though occasionally a bacterial infection such as sinusitis or a middle ear infection can develop following the common cold the decision to treat with antibiotics should be determined by your physician or health-care practitioner."

    "Question": "if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th?",
    "Answer": "the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps!"

    "Question": "how does stress affect fertility?",
    "Answer": "for couples struggling with infertility it's a particularly cruel fact: not only can infertility cause a lot of stress but stress can affect fertility. it's known to contribute to problems with ovulation. for many people the longer you go without conceiving the more stress you feel. fears about infertility may also lead to tension with your partner and that can reduce your chances of pregnancy even further. after all it's hard to have sex if one of you sleeps on the couch. while it's a fact that coping with infertility is stressful that doesn't mean you have to give into it. if your doctor can't find a medical cause for your ovulation problems consider finding support groups or a therapist who can help you learn better ways to cope with the anxieties that come with infertility. the american society of reproductive medicine offers these tips for reducing stress: keep the lines of communication open with your partner. get emotional support. a couples' counselor support groups or books can help you cope. try out some stress-reduction techniques such as meditation or yoga. cut down on caffeine and other stimulants. exercise regularly to release your physical and emotional tension. agree on a medical treatment plan including financial limits with your partner. learn as much as you can about the cause of your infertility and your treatment options."

    "Answer": "groin hernias are somewhat more likely to develop on both sides. this is probably because the structural elements develop symmetrically and the stresses on the body that occur over time are similar on both sides. when a patient becomes aware of a groin swelling on one side examination by a doctor will often identify a small hernia on the opposite side."

    "Question": "where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages textbooks and research journals. they also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines. the food and drug administration (fda) is the part of the u. s. government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the u. s. the fda lets a company sell a medicine in the u. s. if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. companies that make medicines usually have to show fda doctors and scientists whether birth defects or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. most of the time drugs are not studied in pregnant women. the fda works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. but in most cases there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing babies. many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. but a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. here is an example: a medicine is given to pregnant rats. if the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies it may or may not cause problems in human babies. if there are no problems in the rat babies it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies. the fda asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. this improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies. there is a lot that fda doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. in a perfect world every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. unfortunately this is not the case."

    "Answer": "you ask an interesting question. when used as directed for smoking cessation nicotine replacements (such as gum and patches) probably can be safely used for an indefinite period of time. however it's possible to abuse nicotine replacement products by exceeding the maximum dosage. in this case a person could cause him/herself harm over the long run. it's worth noting also that nicotine itself is kind of a 'bad actor. ' it can cause slow wound healing among many other physiological effects. it can deplete the body's vitamin c stores. anyone who uses tobacco products or uses nicotine replacement products should take a vitamin c supplement in my opinion. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "not worried but definitely concerned. your daughter should be evaluated by her pediatrician first and then by a pediatric endocrinologist. the main concern of course would be that she has precocious puberty. what can start out as breast buds could progress to pubic hair if her little brain is somehow sending out singles to her ovaries that she is older than her chronological age. we do not want a four-year old wearing a bra by kindergarten. a bra would not be the major concern however. it would be all of the other bodily changes that start at puberty that is a larger concern. infants can have breast buds due to maternal estrogen but when a four-year old develops breast buds from making estrogen on her own it is concerning and this must be properly evaluated."

    "Answer": "lice are live so a person exposed can have live lice relatively fast if the encounter was sufficient. head to head activities use of combs/brushes sharing hats all can transmit lice from one person to the next almost immediately. nits are either unhatched eggs or the remnants of hatched egges. obviously the unhatched eggs are problematic since they will hatch in about two weeks and be mobile. soon they will be laying there own eggs. nits are firmly glued to the hair shaft. the unhatched nits are within a 1/4 or so of the scalp. the nits do not easily transfer from person to person unless it is with combs or brushes. live lice do not live long off of their chosen human hosts -- several hours at best (they gotta eat! ) so exposure from carpets furniture etc. is possible but considerably less likely. you will need to check your kids (and each other) for the next week looking for live lice and nits. they can be elusive so look carefully. if you don't find them you are probably in the clear from this unwanted birthday party gift. if you do find them they will need to be promptly treated. this is a gift that can keep on giving."

    "Question": "my ears get red suddenly is that a blood pressure issue? . i work 3rd shift and it seems to happen in the early morning. but happens more often now at other times.",
    "Answer": "no \"red hot ears\" is not usually a problem with your blood pressure but it is \"vascular\". in most cases this unusual phenomenon is just a variation of blushing -- warm red blood is shunted to your outer ears giving them that red appearance. unlike other blushing this is not necessarily caused by embarrassment or other triggers; it just happens. for some people the ears can uncomfortably hot or even painful. to the very least it can be embarrassing. there is very little that you can do for this but since you mentioned blood pressure the use of a class of drugs called beta-blockers has been used for red hot ears. these are use for high-blood pressure preventing migraines and other cardiac problems. sometimes it helps; sometimes it doesn't. it would be up to you to convince your doctor to prescribe them for this purpose. red hot ears are harmless but if you consider the problem severe beta-blockers may be worth a try. there are many discussions about red hot ears on webmd's ear nose and throat community board. if the ear is red and hot only along the top two thirds or so where the cartilage is located and the tip of the ear or the ear lobe is still close to normal in color the problem could be relapsing polychondritis. this is a very rare autoimmune disease that attacks the cartilage in the body and is not limited to the ear. it can attack the trachea heart valves eyes joints and connective tissue. this can be a very dangerous disease that is very difficult to diagnose as only about 3 or so people out of every 1 million ever develop the disease. mayo clinic has a good easy to understand write up about it. if you suspect that this may be your problem after reading the mayo and/or other articles you would do well to contact a rheumatologist and mention it to him/her. be sure to bring up the name \"relapsing polychondritis\" as most doctors have never seen this disease. it took me ten years to get diagnosed. i have the same issue and i see it was suggested to try beta blockers here. given that it does not seem to be an issue to be concerned about is it worth to run the risk of beta blocker's side effects to deal with this? thanks for your answer. hi - i've had the same problem for the past 3 - 5 years; for no obvious reason one or both ears suddenly heats up most often at night. if this happens while i'm sleeping i end up with a migraine so what i do is drink a lot of water before i go to sleep - meaning i have to wake up to pee; i then also douse my ears and neck with water to cool down. kind of unpleasant but it's the only way i know to fend off a day-long fuzzy-brain headache. about the beta-blockers: i was given one (propranolol) for the migraines; took it for about 18 months but it didn't seem to make a huge difference. and it didn't have any impact at all on the hot ear syndrome. hope this helps. i had red ear syndrome and although ibcouldnt find a trigger i visited a chiropractor for a different reason. after an adjustment on my neck my ear immediately turned red. i then returned for about 5 neck adjustments and he fixed the problem. that was five years ago and i'm convinced movement in my neck was occasionally hitting a nerve."

    "Answer": "fruit and veggies are full of vitamins and minerals like vitamins a and c. meat contains protein and minerals like iron and zinc. without knowing your age and what else you are eating it sounds like you could use a daily multivitamin with minerals if you don't eat much meat or fruit and veggies. find one that that provides 100% of the daily value for most vitamins and minerals. you can also get lab work done to see if you need additional iron or vitamin d. for more on how much to take see this webmd article. good luck!"

    "Answer": "you're right that you should still be fully protected against pregnancy since you doubled up on a pill instead of skipping it. i'd recommend you continue the pack as usual and then start the new pack a day early. in other words just continue as if you didn't take the extra pill. hope this helps!"

(they're also not expired) i just want to know if anything terrible is going to to result from me taking them.",
    "Answer": "the terrible thing is that you may or may not need any antibiotics. most viral infections are viruses and do not require antibiotics. a few are strep but making a \"self-diagnosis\" based solely on symptoms is not much better than a coin toss. some viral sore throats are mono (mononucleosis). i can't blindly diagnose you over the internet and you may or may not have the skills to accurately diagnose yourself so my recommendation is for you to be tested for strep at student health. a simple rapid test if you do have it then the amoxicillin may be appropriate (assuming you have the proper dose. you didn't share that information) for your weight and severity of infection."

    "Question": "when do i use an antacid versus an h2 blocker versus a proton pump inhibitor?",
    "Answer": "that's a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is. if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product. you want to make sure though that you shake it really well; a lot of people forget about that. also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it; either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine won't work as well. if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker. pepcid is one consideration. zantac. you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications. zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines. so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions. if it's two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that. you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing. then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation."

    "Question": "what is prostate cancer?",
    "Answer": "prostate cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor (growth) that consists of cells from the prostate gland. generally the tumor usually grows slowly and remains confined to the gland for many years. during this time the tumor produces little or no symptoms or outward signs (abnormalities on physical examination). however all prostate cancers do not behave similarly. some aggressive types of prostate cancer grow and spread more rapidly than others and can cause a significant shortening of life expectancy in men affected by them. a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness is the gleason score which is calculated by a trained pathologist observing prostate biopsy specimens under the microscope. as the cancer advances however it can spread beyond the prostate into the surrounding tissues (local spread). moreover the cancer also can metastasize (spread even farther) throughout other areas of the body such as the bones lungs and liver. symptoms and signs therefore are more often associated with advanced prostate cancer."

    "Question": "what types of medications are available to treat nausea and vomiting?",
    "Answer": "drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting are called antiemetics. many types of antiemetics can decrease the severity of nausea although most require a medical evaluation and prescription. medicines available over-the-counter are mainly recommended for use in motion sickness and for cases of mild nausea. meclizine hydrochloride (bonine) is an antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of nausea vomiting and dizziness associated with motion sickness. unless recommended by a doctor it should not be taken by people with lung diseases glaucoma or those who have difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate. meclizine may cause drowsiness and should not be taken with other sedatives such as alcohol tranquilizers or sleeping pills. due to drowsiness people using meclizine should not drive or operate dangerous machinery. meclizine is not recommended in children under 12 or in pregnant or nursing women unless recommended by a doctor. dimenhydrinate (dramamine) also is an antihistamine. its use should be limited to motion sickness. it can cause drowsiness and should be avoided in the same situations as meclizine. several different formulations of dimenhydrinate are available including a children's liquid which should be used according to the directions under the direction of a doctor. dramamine less drowsy formula contains meclizine like bonine and may have fewer sedative side effects. both meclizine and dimenhydrinate are recommended to be taken about an hour before travel to prevent motion sickness. emetrol is an oral solution designed to soothe the stomach when nausea and vomiting are caused by a viral or bacterial infection or overeating. emetrol contains sugar and phosphoric acid. diabetes patients should not use emetrol without medical supervision because of the concentrated sugar. according to its manufacturer emetrol should not be taken for more than five doses in one hour without consulting a doctor. consult a doctor before using this medicine for pregnant or nursing women and young children. bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) is a product containing bismuth subsalicylate a chemical shown to be effective in relieving nausea and upset stomach. this remedy has a direct effect on the stomach lining and has no known serious side effects. it may cause darkening of the stool color and of the tongue. pregnant or nursing women should consult their doctors before using bismuth subsalicylate since part of the active ingredient (salicylate) is chemically similar to aspirin which may harm infants and the fetus. patients allergic to aspirin or related drugs also should not use bismuth subsalicylate. use under the direction of a doctor if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or have diabetes or gout because the salicylate may further promote the anticoagulant effect."

    "Answer": "the symptoms of early cataract may be improved with new eyeglasses brighter lighting anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. if these measures do not help surgery is the only effective treatment. surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. a cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities such as driving reading or watching tv. you and your eye care professional can make this decision together. sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. for example a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. if you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times usually four to eight weeks apart."

    "Answer": "however in this case two different issues are being confused: calorie intake versus a diabetic diet. whether or not you have diabetes your calorie needs depend on your current weight activity level and desired (ideal) weight. if you need to lose weight you should eat fewer calories per day. the example you cited above contains about 1540 calories. this is a diet for someone who wants to lose weight. to give you an example a female who is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds requires about 1700 calories per day to maintain that weight even if she gets little to no activity during the day. a man who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds would require many more calories per day even with no exercise involved. many people with type 2 diabetes do indeed need to lose weight. you should consult your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator for guidelines on calorie intake. eating to maintain blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the day doesn't really revolve around the number of calories consumed. maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is more about the types of foods you eat. a good diet for diabetes should be balanced with whole grains (no refined grains) vegetables fruits protein and healthy fats (such as olive oil or canola oil). this sample meal plan for type 2 diabetes from webmd offers ideas about the types of food you should eat but the calories in this meal plan may or may not be adequate for your sex height and current weight. if you have questions about how to eat healthy to control or reverse (with type 2) your diabetes consult your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator. best wishes to you!"

    "Answer": "if the eel was fumigated maybe that's causing a bit of an issue. honestly your case of the nerves over being forced to eat something is likely to be the main cause of this especially if they are not having diarrhea. or you could have gotten it from some other issue that's happening at the same time. sushi and sashimi have to be prepared under some pretty high standards in most cases i'd trust it more than a regular hamburger."

    "Answer": "in chronic stress particularly when a person lives with long-standing uncertainty about safety or shelter or other risky situations there is a chronic over-stimulation of the fight/flight response and the sympathetic nervous system. the most prominent hormonal effect is on adrenaline and cortisol from the adrenal glands. these hormones can raise the blood sugar levels and cause chronic overstimulation of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. we can measure hormone levels in the blood fairly easily and we can measure cortisol in the saliva as well. in research studies we can measure brain activity using functional mri scanning with hyperactivity of the subconsious parts of the brain involved in flight/flight. in animal experiments they can monitor sympathetic nervous system activity and tone. this is not practical for individual patients however."

    "Question": "how does testing for lactose intolerance differ in adults?",
    "Answer": "lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the lactose tolerance test or the lactose hydrogen breath test. the lactose tolerance and lactose hydrogen breath tests are not given to infants and very young children who are suspected of having lactose intolerance because they require cooperation for multiple samplings of blood or breath which can be difficult if the infant or child is not cooperative. the dose of lactose that is needed for the lactose tolerance and hydrogen breath tests also may present problems for infants and very young children since if they are intolerant of lactose they may develop diarrhea and become dehydrated. special masks have been developed for infants and very young children that can make the sampling of breath for the lactose hydrogen breath test easier to perform."

    "Question": "quit smoking 8 days ago how long before the nicotine is out of my system. i am also taking chantix i have been taking it for seventeen day s now and feeling very good.",
    "Answer": "nicotine levels in your body will drop significantly between 8 to 12 hours after your last cigarette. your body won’t be completely nicotine-free until 24 to 72 hours afterwards however. do an internet search for “smoking cessation timeline” if you’re curious about some of the other benefits that you’ll notice by becoming smoke free. for example after 24 hours your risk of having a heart attack decreases dramatically and your ability to smell and taste will be enhanced after 48 hours. after years of having quit smoking your risk of developing cancer having a heart attack or having a stroke decrease significantly. quitting smoking is one of the most important things that you can do for your health. keep up the great work! my understanding is that the nicotine is out of your system within 24 hours."

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?",
    "Answer": "common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding and diarrhea but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. generally patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. the different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation: ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. in many patients with ulcerative proctitis mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may in addition experience rectal pain urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling) and tenesmus (ineffective painful urge to move one's bowels). proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). symptoms of proctosigmoiditis like that of proctitis include rectal bleeding urgency and tenesmus. some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and the descending colon). symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal cramps weight loss and left-sided abdominal pain. pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon left colon transverse colon and the rectum). symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal pain and cramps weight loss fatigue fever and night sweats. some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. generally however patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration severe abdominal pain protracted diarrhea with bleeding and even shock. they are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colon rupture (perforation). patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. unless they respond to treatment promptly surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colon rupture. while the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. therefore when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his disease the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. nevertheless a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. thus patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis."

    "Question": "what is high blood pressure?",
    "Answer": "high blood pressure or hypertension means high pressure (tension) in the arteries. arteries are vessels that carry blood from the pumping heart to all the tissues and organs of the body. high blood pressure does not mean excessive emotional tension although emotional tension and stress can temporarily increase blood pressure. normal blood pressure is below 120/80; blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89 is called \"pre-hypertension\" and a blood pressure of 140/90 or above is considered high. the top number which is the systolic blood pressure corresponds to the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries. the bottom number the diastolic pressure represents the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes after the contraction. the diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure to which the arteries are exposed. an elevation of the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure increases the risk of developing heart (cardiac) disease kidney (renal) disease hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) eye damage and stroke (brain damage). these complications of hypertension are often referred to as end-organ damage because damage to these organs is the end result of chronic (long duration) high blood pressure. for that reason the diagnosis of high blood pressure is important so efforts can be made to normalize blood pressure and prevent complications. it was previously thought that rises in diastolic blood pressure were a more important risk factor than systolic elevations but it is now known that in people 50 years and older systolic hypertension represents a greater risk. affecting approximately one in four adults in the united states hypertension is clearly a major public health problem."

    "Question": "how do i calculate my target heart rate during aerobic exercise?",
    "Answer": "heart rate reserve your heart beat rises during aerobic exercise. it can rise from 70 beats per minutes (bpm) at rest to as high as 170 bpm or even higher during exercise depending on the intensity of the exercise your fitness level your age and other factors. whether you train aerobically or anaerobically is determined by the intensity of your workout and monitoring the intensity is the key to know if you are working out aerobically. for many individuals simply monitoring how the body feels while exercising is enough to determine the proper aerobic intensity. “warm and slightly out of breath\" is a good measure for aerobic activity; that is ask yourself if you feel warm and slightly out of breath while you're exercising and if the answer is \"yes \" then that's good enough. on the other hand some people like to know with more precision how their body is doing during exercise. if that's the case for you then taking your heart rate during exercise and using a target heart rate training zone might be just the ticket. target heart rate zones range anywhere from 50% to 100% of your maximum heart rate (your maximum heart rate is based on your age). aerobic exercise is anything less than 85% and anaerobic exercise is anything above that. a nice starting point for a sedentary individual is somewhere in the range from 50% to 65% (you can always increase as you get more fit) and 65% to 85% for more conditioned individuals. try the heart rate reserve method for calculating a target heart rate. here's the formula and an example of the method for someone 27 years old assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm and a training range of 70%. if you plug in other values you can get other ranges. 1. 220-age = max hr. 2. subtract resting heart rate from max hr = heart rate reserve (hrr). 3. multiply hrr times percent you want to train at. 4. add back resting heart rate. assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm 27 years old and 70% training range: 220 - 27 = 193 193 - 70 = 123 123 x. 70% = 86 86 + 70 = 156"

    "Question": "can you get pregnant from genital rubbing without ejaculation? . my fiance and i were fooling around the 22 october. i ejaculated nowhere near her genitals. i did not urinate after the ejaculation. she got on top of me and our genitals rubbed without any penetration. i did not orgasm. we are both virgins. on the 7th november she did a home pregnancy test as her period was late and the result was negative. she later did 2 different (brands) pregnancy tests on the 10 november and it was also negative. her last period started around the 7 or 8 october.",
    "Answer": "your fiance is not likely pregnant based on those negative tests but those things can be very frightening. a late period can be due to stress. it is biologically possible (albeit rare) to get pregnant if any rogue sperm somehow make it into the vagina at the time your partner is ovulating. seminal fluid -- the clear fluid that will leak prior to ejaculation and during sexual stimulation -- can have viable sperm living in it from a prior ejaculation so it is best not to have this type of genital to genital contact in the future unless you are wearing a condom or if your fiance is not taking any form of birth control."

    "Question": "are there different types of vaccines?",
    "Answer": "there are two major categories of vaccines. the first category of vaccine is made from live viruses that have been \"attenuated\" or weakened so that they usually do not cause the disease. in some cases the vaccine itself does cause the disease. usually the disease caused by the vaccine is milder than the natural disease. the second category of vaccine inactivated vaccine is produced by growing the bacterium or virus in culture and then inactivating it (killing it) by using heat or chemicals. these vaccines cannot cause the disease but allow the body to develop immunity. while these vaccines are safer they do not produce protection as good as that from the live vaccines. these vaccines require multiple doses and often require periodic supplementation. live attenuated vaccines measles mumps rubella vaccinia varicella zoster yellow fever rotavirus intranasal influenza oral polio bcg oral typhoid inactivated (killed) vaccines diphtheria tetanus polio shot hepatitis a hepatitis b rabies influenza shot pertussis acellular pertussis human papillomavirus anthrax typhoid cholera pneumococcal meningococcal salmonella haemophilus influenza type b"

    "Question": "what causes gallstones?",
    "Answer": "there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause. cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol. they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas. cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile. (secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body). in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; fats do not dissolve in watery solutions. in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents -- bile acids and lecithin -- into the bile. these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve. similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve. in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones. there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself. the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow. pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia. there are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones and 2) brown pigment gallstones. pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells. the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood. bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile. black pigment gallstones: if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones. the pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard. brown pigment gallstones: if there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. the bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. the pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. this type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. it also is softer than black pigment gallstones. other types of gallstones. other types of gallstones are rare. perhaps the most interesting type of gallstone is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic ceftriaxone (rocephin). ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. it combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. like cholesterol and pigment the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is stopped but they still may cause problems until they disappear. another rare type of gallstone is formed from calcium carbonate."

    "Question": "how are cataracts diagnosed?",
    "Answer": "cataracts are detected during a medical eye examination by an eye-care professional. the abnormal lens can be seen using a variety of specialized viewing instruments. using a variety of tests your doctor is able to tell how much a cataract may be affecting your vision. usual eye tests include testing visual acuity glare sensitivity color vision contrast sensitivity and a thorough examination of all other parts of the eye. your doctor will make sure vision loss is not due to other common eye problems including diabetes glaucoma or macular degeneration. most cataracts associated with aging develop slowly and many patients may not notice visual loss until it is fairly advanced. despite being told that you have cataracts it is not imperative to have surgery to remove them until they begin to affect your vision. the development of cataracts is unpredictable; some cataracts remain small and never progress to the point where they affect vision and require treatment while others progress more quickly. thus the decision and timing to proceed with cataract surgery is individualized for each patient. your doctor will be able to tell you how much of your vision loss is due to cataracts and the type of visual recovery that may be expected if surgery is chosen."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very unpleasant! a number of things could be going on here but it's not likely your gallbladder is involved. the gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage. it's doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder. i can think of any number of reasons you'd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a rotator cuff injury to an aggravated bursa. the only way to find out what's going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an x-ray. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider (pcp) to have this evaluated. it would be helpful to evaluate it when it's actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time. even if you're not having a pain episode your pcp might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment. best of luck to you! the main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest. this pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough. some people feel the pain in the shoulder. deep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worse. pleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity. this can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms: bluish skin color (cyanosis) coughing shortness of breath rapid breathing (tachypnea) pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. this inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisy. it may also occur with: asbestos-related disease certain cancers chest trauma pulmonary embolus rheumatoid arthritis lupus copied from:<link> when i have my pains it is in the middle of my back. it doesn't start on the right or left. it starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move. the only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieve's or 2 midol's. i had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything. they said it was my breathing but i can't remember if that was exactly the case. i lost 41 pounds but i could still feel the start of it but i would take medicine before it could go any further."

    "Answer": "there are no treatments similar to botox that last longer. botox does work very well in the right candidate to smooth neck bands but not for excess skin. there are new radiofrequency and less invasive liposuction-like devices that are coming in the next year or so that may work well for \"turkey necks\" but nothing beyond liposuction and plastic surgery for now."

    "Question": "why don’t men take better care of themselves?",
    "Answer": "the problem is when men are young they’re going to live forever nothing’s going to get in their way that’s why young guys do stupid things. because it’s not going to hurt them. why are teenagers promiscuous in the face of hiv hepatitis c and all those other diseases because it will happen to somebody else but it won’t happen to them and then as men get older they get into this pattern of reactive care. they don’t understand about proactive health care they don’t understand that that’s their body for life that they have to be in tune with their body and take care of it and if they do the quality of their life experience will be dramatically improved. but when they do these abusive things when they drink too much drugs overweight then that impacts on them. they don’t realize that that “never happening to me ” it will happen and then it’s just around the corner. and then it’s often too late. why is it too late? because they’ve had years of abusive behaviors. they’ve eaten the wrong foods they’ve had too much to drink they smoke hypertension diabetes liver disorders cholesterol problems. and those are the guys you know you read about people in their 40s and 50s who suddenly get a heart attack and die or have a massive stroke. it doesn’t make sense. sometimes it’s random bad luck but sometimes it’s things they’ve been doing all these years. unlike women who mentally society programs them to be into preventative health. they go to the ob-gyn young in life. they go to the doctor for checkups. women are the leaders in health care in this country almost all of the health care decisions are driven by women. i’m sure on webmd a lot of the women in fact on the men’s health message board a lot of times it’s women asking the questions. you want to wonder if it’s about blood in the semen or erection disorders or pain or lumps or bumps how come the guy isn’t there asking the question himself? and it’s because that’s not what guys do. guys will comment on it but i don’t know whether it’s fear or denial or maybe they don’t value themselves enough but the wives are the ones that go online and ask the questions. even on your message board. even on the men’s health message board. women are the ones asking the questions."

    "Answer": "i don't know if you are a teen boy or girl but there are many things that can be done to control acne. acne is mostly caused by your raging hormones and those hormones are doing some very important things right now. you need them. consider acne an unavoidable side-effect. acne is temporary but it can last years. improperly treated or managed your acne can leave permanent scars so i would recommend that you see a dermatologist. yes some topical acne medications cause dryness and other temporary skin changes. you must learn to tolerate them for the greater benefit that can be achieved by remaining on them. i don't know what you have tried but under the careful eye of a trained medical professional i am confident that you can find the right medication regime that can achieve the optimum results. many teens expect too much; too soon when under acne treatment. they want a blemish-free face overnight and this does not happen. it can take months or a year or more of treatment to control acne. only getting older will cure your acne and unfortunately many adults will still get it. don't be frustrated. you are not alone and many of the adults around you were struggling when they were teens as well. the advantage you have now is that there are effective treatments. all we basically had when we were teens was soap!"

    "Answer": "any sudden changes in bowels should be checked out by a healthcare provider. here are some things you can do in the meantime: increase fiber: gradually increase fruits vegetables whole grains and beans/legumes. these foods contain fiber that help with constipation. it's recommended women (19-50) get 25g of fiber daily and for men (19-50) it's 38g. see getting enough fiber. stay hydrated: while increasing fiber make sure you get enough water. when you are dehydrated water is reabsorbed from stool resulting in hard stools. keep active: regular activity also helps relieve constipation. walking dancing and hiking are just a few ideas to keep your body moving. add fermented foods: look for ways to increase foods with probiotics such as yogurt kefir and probioitc drinks. adding a probiotic may help but the research is not clear on this. see probiotics and digestive health. manage stress better: anxiety worry and stress can all affect your gi tract. working on healthy ways to handle daily stressors can help! see stress management."

    "Answer": "the biggest factor may be genetics -- not something that you can change unfortunately. it is still impossible to increase weight without eating more calories than you body needs to maintain weight so her diet may still need some adjustments. she may be sneaking in extra calories at night or at school. i worry about the \"strict diet\" comment. while i do not know her height and weight children are growing and must have sufficient calories for that. you don't want her to cry because she is hungry or develop a negative self-image about her weight. when she becomes a teenager these messages can backfire and you could end up with a bulimic child so be very very careful. keep an accurate food diary and see where you can trim. give her a huge salad and non-calorie drink before dinner and pace the speed of her eating. serve dinner on a plate (a small plate) and do not have leftovers. be more like a restaurant than an all-you-can-eat buffet. have low-calorie snacks (sugar free jello) apples etc. for dessert but make her wait an hour or so after dinner. involve the whole family. at her age losing a pound or so a month is a triumph. even if she stays the same this is progress. in a few years hormones are going to be playing a significant role and the strategies will change."

    "Answer": "there really aren't any foods you need to avoid while taking coumadin. since coumadin works on vitamin k foods that are high in vitamin k can affect your inr (the test to measure how well your coumadin is working). foods like kale spinach collard greens and brussels sprouts all have high amounts of vitamin k. while you shouldn't binge on them one day and avoid them the next if you have one or two servings a week consistently you should not notice a difference."

    "Answer": "this combination medication is used to temporarily treat symptoms caused by the common cold flu allergies or other breathing illnesses (such as sinusitis bronchitis). dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that affects a certain part of the brain reducing the urge to cough. decongestants help relieve stuffy nose and ear congestion symptoms. acetaminophen (apap) is a non-aspirin pain reliever and fever reducer. antihistamines help relieve watery eyes itchy eyes/nose/throat runny nose and sneezing. this medication is not usually used for ongoing coughs from smoking asthma or other long-term breathing problems (such as emphysema) or for coughs with a lot of mucus unless directed by your doctor. cough-and-cold products have not been shown to be safe or effective in children younger than 6 years. therefore do not use this product to treat cold symptoms in children younger than 6 years unless specifically directed by the doctor. some products (such as long-acting tablets/capsules) are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years. ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details about using your product safely. these products do not cure or shorten the length of the common cold and may cause serious side effects. to decrease the risk for serious side effects carefully follow all dosage directions. do not use this product to make a child sleepy. do not give other cough-and-cold medication that might contain the same or similar ingredients (see also drug interactions section). ask the doctor or pharmacist about other ways to relieve cough and cold symptoms (such as drinking enough fluids using a humidifier or saline nose drops/spray)."

    "Answer": "many medications are safe to split. because of this insurance companies and doctors are increasing prescribing higher dose scored tablets as a cost savings for patients. yet some medications are compromised when they are split and this should not be done. for example capsules or tablets without a score or pills with an exterior coating shouldn’t be split. splitting these medications could result in uneven doses of treatment and can causes harm under-treatment or inadvertent overdose of medications. to see if your medication can be split check the ‘how supplied’ section of the package or ask your pharmacist. yes you can cut them in half. i just called my own pharmacist and asked this very question today and was told i could absolutely cut it in half. i don't see why not. i wouldn't recommend taking less than the doctor perscribed though. if it's a tablet then use a pill cutter or a thin knife to cut it in half. if it's a capsule or something else i don't think it can be cut in half. hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that \"comes and goes. \" usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were \"fine\" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is -- if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well!"

    "Answer": "hi after doing research come up with this. you may notice a tingling or burning sensation on your lips or face several days prior to the emergence of a cold sore. once the sore erupts you will see a red raised blister full of fluid which will usually be painful and tender to the touch. the sore will remain for two to three weeks and it is contagious until it crusts over. your first cold sore may not appear for up to 20 days following infection with the herpes simplex virus. in addition to one or several sores you may experience any of the following symptoms during an outbreak: fever muscle aches swollen lymph nodes touching your cold sore before touching your eyes can cause eye infections. you should seek immediate medical care if you develop an eye infection during a cold sore outbreak. this is because infections caused by herpes simplex can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. i think the best thing you can do now is get to an std/gum clinic you do need to have tests done but do this asap don't be afraid the staff really do know what there doing it would be your best way to go for the help you now need. i do hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "it's always concerning to have unexpected after-effects from surgery. the pain you're describing isn't unusual after an anterior cervical discectomy. the surgical positioning for that procedure can cause upper back muscle stiffness and soreness that lingers. in addition sometimes as the previously compressed spinal nerves come back to life they can cause tingling shooting or stabbing pain in areas where sensation previously was limited. all that said if your post-surgical pain is getting worse instead of better it's always a good idea to call your surgeon's office and speak to the nurse or physician assistant (pa). he or she can tell you what's expected in terms of pain and the general course of recovery. best of luck to you!"

    "Answer": "drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: aliskiren ace inhibitors (such as lisinopril) angiotensin ii receptor blockers (such as valsartan losartan) cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel \"blood thinners\" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer this is a question only your doctor can answer. sometimes doctors keep their cardiac stent patients on blood thinners like clopidogrel (plavix) for at least one year after surgery. that's because platelets can stick to the stents and cause a blood clot. you should not discontinue the plavix unless your doctor specifically tells you it's ok. so. take a trip to the cardiologist and ask him or her when you can stop taking the clopidogrel. and good luck with the kidney transplant!"

    "Question": "can a girl get pregnant from precum the day after her period then taking the morning after pill. i had sex with my gf twice this weekend. once on sat night and once sun morning. i did not use a condom nor did i cum inside of her. she just got off her period the day before we had sex. i was worried so i had her take the morning after pill. she also took the morning after pill last month for the same incident. should she be ok not getting pregnant since i didnt cum inside her and she took the pill?",
    "Answer": "the short answer is yes and no. yes she can get pregnant from pre-cum and no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends. the long answer is as follows: using a condom and/or birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby. most health departments will offer both at little to no cost. if it is true that her period ended on friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant day after pill or not. sperm can live for 24-72 hours in the female body. most will die off en-route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm. a woman's cycle works like this. period starts and triggers a turn of events. the lh phase is the phase when her body is not fertile typically 10-16 days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle. then the fertile days come in to play. for about 4-5 days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant. once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy. i would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month. mostly because i don't see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should. at least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant. it can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy. please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a 'normal' cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period. this information comes from personal experience with tracking my own cycle to achieve pregnancy which i have done successfully. best of luck to you both!"

    "Question": "what medications and treatments are available to treat food allergies?",
    "Answer": "medicine is used to treat some food allergies. medicines to treat a severe allergic reaction or an anaphylactic reaction are packaged in a prescribed allergy kit. for mild allergic reactions people often try nonprescription medicines first. you can try prescription medicines if nonprescription medicines fail to control allergy symptoms or cause drowsiness or other bothersome side effects. medication choices medicines used to treat a severe allergic reaction include: epinephrine. epinephrine is given as a shot. it acts quickly to stop the further release of histamine and to relax the muscles that help you breathe. antihistamines. antihistamines block the action of histamine during an allergic reaction and help improve symptoms such as itching and sneezing. corticosteroids. these medicines help reduce inflammation. medicines used to relieve mild food allergy symptoms include: antihistamines and corticosteroids for hives gastrointestinal symptoms or sneezing and a runny nose. bronchodilators for asthma symptoms. bronchodilators relax the airways of the lungs making it easier to breathe. what to think about medicines that treat symptoms of food allergies can have side effects. they are typically used for short periods and are discontinued as soon as symptoms are resolved. the best way to avoid symptoms is to avoid the food you are allergic to. read all food labels and be aware that sometimes food allergens are called by other names on food labels. there is no medicine that you can take before eating a certain food that will reliably prevent an allergic reaction to that food. allergy shots (desensitization therapy) for food allergies are considered experimental and are not recommended. a recent small study of a medicine for peanut allergy showed promising results. the medicine called an anti-ige drug binds to the antibodies (ige) released during an allergic reaction to peanut. 9 a larger study is under way to find out whether this medicine is safe and effective for people who have peanut allergies. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "what if my therapy is not helping my depression?",
    "Answer": "1- start with any therapist you like. ask if they use time-limited short-term therapy or open-ended long-term. if the latter ask how long is long term. 2- work with your therapist weekly for 8-12 sessions. often patients feel they don't click have some conflict and quit therapy too soon. just like patients quit medicines too soon. a key to therapy is to discuss that you feel you are not getting along or there are conflicts in the therapy itself. sometimes it is not the content of what happened to you during the week that is important to discuss it is the process of dealing with your therapist that is actually the therapy! 3- if you are not at least partially better after about 6 months seriously ask your therapist what chance you have of responding to their therapy techniques. consider adding a med add a group therapy that uses a different style or skill consider changing therapists. 4- if you are not better at all after a year really consider a new therapist who uses a different therapy style. it doesn't mean your therapist is poor at doing therapy it means the therapy style isn't helping you. if you are gradually improving even at a slow pace stick with the therapist forever -- as long as you are improving. some therapies can take several years but expect to see gradual improvement. 5. like using antidepressants some meds don't work for some people. so we switch and add meds around. some psychotherapies do not work for some people either. know when to stay in and know when to get out. have this discussion with your therapist if you feel stuck."

    "Answer": "sometimes doctors can find the cause of a couple's infertility by doing a complete fertility evaluation. this process usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories. if there are no obvious problems like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation tests will be needed. for a man doctors usually begin by testing his semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. for a woman the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are several ways to do this at home or doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries. if the woman is ovulating normally more tests are needed. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography: in this test doctors use x-rays to check for physical problems of the uterus and fallopian tubes. laparoscopy: during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy."

    "Question": "when should i use a professional clinic for my post-op recovery?",
    "Answer": "i believe if one has a more invasive procedure such as a major tummy tuck and a major face and neck lift again these can be long operations recovery in a professional facility trumps recovering at home. now again in most big cities now there are facilities for patients to recover with professional care. these are dedicated focused again super specialized facilities. we have 4 or 5 of them within a few miles of this office here in beverly hills. one is in a wing of a hotel. the wing is not for hotel guests. it’s exclusive it’s secured only for patients who’ve had cosmetic surgery. i’m not the only surgeon to utilize it. my colleagues use it also. what they provide is a comforting professionally administered post-operative sojourn. we provide the medications they provide the tender loving care and most importantly they act as my eyes and ears because when i call that facility at 8:00 o’clock at night and again at 10 to check on the patient talk to the nurse she’s telling me how they are doing how’s the pulse how’s the blood pressure is there too much bruising is there any discomfort? i mean these are signs that i may even have to go check them out go down there and take a look. but they kind of know how to sort things out. they know what to expect because this is all they do. these nurses know what to expect they have my written instructions they have their little pharmacy there of the medicines that i have provided them in case of say a sudden elevation of blood pressure. most people aren’t going to have that but occasionally somebody does. again we don’t want to have to wait to have a pharmacy to send anything over. again forethought planning they are in an environment which is a couple of notches below a hospital see? is there an extra cost for that? there is. for the patient that has that service basically the cost is built into the service. in other words it’s an outsourced cost if you will. or if the patient wants to pay for it directly themselves they can but basically they usually just pay us for all the services and we pay the outpatient surgery center and the doctor anesthesiologist and then the hideaway because frankly it’s just simpler for the patient to write one check for all of the services and we take care of the details. again we’re acting like a general contractor but all the subcontractors are fine with that and it works out fine. and patients like to know that they are in an environment where they are safe and they are safe and we can’t expect their brother or sister to be able to pick up the early signs of say leakage of blood under the skin in excess of what we expect or more bleeding after the nose job. we can’t expect the average lay person to ascertain whether this is normal or it is not normal. but our nurses know and frankly it’s a service that is mandatory for certain procedures. in other words if someone is having a face lift in our practice they have to go there. they have no choice. it’s not an option. again it’s part of the service built into the fee. i can tell you that a service like that runs around $700 a night $750 something in that range. but you’re getting your hotel service by the way a round the clock kitchen and it’s special meals. they know what to do. and the nursing and they even have a limo that brings the patient back and forth. so basically when the patient is dropped off at the surgery center in the morning when it’s time to go to the hide away and that may be 3 4 5 o’clock in the afternoon they have no worldly concerns. the family is off the hook because hey mrs. smith is being picked up taken there they are going to look after her they bring her back in the office in the morning. sometimes a one night stay is required sometimes a two night stay and by the way some patients elect to stay 3 or 4 nights if they feel like popping for that luxury but typically 1 or 2 nights is all they need. it’s a great service. it is unique i think in communities where cosmetic surgery is done in large volume. i wouldn’t expect to find that type of facility in a town of 200 00 people it’s just not likely."

    "Answer": "the national athletic trainers' association recommends the following hydration guidelines for exercise: 1. two to three hours pre-exercise: 17 to 20 fluid ounces of water or sports drink. 2. ten to 20 minutes pre-exercise: 7 to 10 ounces of water or sports drink. 3. during exercise: fluid replacement should approximate sweat and urine losses and at least maintain hydration at less than 2% body weight reduction. this generally requires 7 to 10 ounces of water or sports drink every 10 to 20 minutes. include carbohydrates in the beverage if the exercise is intense or lasts more then 45-50 minutes. water alone will suffice and save calories if the exercise is moderate or less than 45-50 minutes. 4. post-exercise: athletes should weigh themselves nude before and after workouts to learn how much weight is lost from sweat (water and salt) and then ingest fluid equal to 150% of the weight loss ideally within two hours and no more than four to six hours after the event. including sodium in the drink allows fluid volume to be better conserved and increases the drive to drink and carbohydrate in the drink will improve the rate of intestinal absorption of the fluid as well as replenish glycogen stores in the muscles and liver. 5. the volume of fluid in the stomach is critically important for proper hydration. maintaining 12 to 20 ounces of fluid in the stomach will optimize gastric emptying and prevent dehydration. concentrations of 4% to 8% of carbohydrates should be used if they are included in the fluid (for example gatorade and other energy drinks). concentrations higher than 8% slow the rate of fluid absorption while 6% to 8% concentrations are optimal for hydration and performance. the effects of dehydration can be profound. they are: 1. a loss of just 1% to 2% of body weight begins to compromise cardiovascular body temperature regulation and muscular function and can lead to decreases in aerobic power. for example heart rate rises an additional three to five beats per minute for every 1% of body weight loss. 2. muscle endurance and maximal aerobic power decreases when 3% to 4% of body weight is lost. slightly more than 2% loss of body weight can result in as much as a 35% to 48% reduction in physical work capacity. 3. dehydration of greater than 3% of body weight increases the risk of developing exertional heat illness (heat cramps heat exhaustion or heat stroke). heat illness is common in sports and can occur after just one hour of intense exercise in the heat. as for drinking too much there has been a great deal of discussion and some controversy recently over the issue of over-hydration during athletic events and the risk of abnormally low sodium (hyponatremia). it started when runners at a marathon presented at the finish line with what appeared to be dehydration. the medical people confused the symptoms of hyponatremia with dehydration (the symptoms are similar) and so they rehydrated the runners with intravenous fluids in the medical tent then rushed them to the emergency room where they subsequently died not from dehydration but from over-hydration. hyponatremia is an electrolyte disorder where not enough sodium (salt) is present in the body fluids outside the cells. as a result water enters the cells in an attempt to balance the concentration of salt outside the cells and the cells swell as a result of the excess water. most cells can accommodate the swelling but brain cells cannot because the skull confines them. brain swelling accounts for most of the symptoms of hyponatremia which include: loss of appetite nausea vomiting headache restlessness fatigue irritability abnormal mental status possible coma hallucinations consciousness decreased confusion convulsions muscle weakness muscle spasms or cramps both hyper- and hypohydration are conditions that can and should be prevented. weigh yourself without clothing before and after your workouts to determine how much fluid you lose and then replace those fluids as per the nata guidelines. a liter water of water weighs 2. 25 pounds and so you can make your calculations based on that information."

    "Answer": "viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year. please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since i have no way of examining you. the most important thing is fluid replacement. you must stay well-hydrated. don't eat very much for a few more days. most of these viral infections resolve in about 7-10 days so hang in there. at least you are not vomiting so be greatful. in my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas. your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined."

    "Answer": "the key statement in your question is this: \"one thing that worries me. \" any time you are experiencing a health condition that worries you it's a good enough reason to consult a medical professional. usually shaving or waxing can produce bumps so the fact your lesion is concave (caves inward) could indicate there's something else going on. the only way to tell for sure is to have a physical examination by a health care provider. he or she can either set your mind at ease or diagnose the problem to get you prompt treatment. i hope this helps!"

    "Answer": "we have several friends who are bipolar and they do not steal. there is no relationship to her stealing to the bipolar disorders. she just steals. more concerning would be a possible addiction to (narcotic) pain medication. hide your pills. keep them out of your medicine cabinet where she is likely snooping when using the bathroom. put the pain medication bottle in there (no pills) with some m&ms and note asking her to get some help. in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsively/partake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it. but it is no excuse to lie/cheat/steal. there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc. call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure he/she would be a good help. bipolar disorder is about moods. lying cheating stealing is about their character. she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one. no bi-polar disorder doesn't directly cause her to steal meds but the illness can cause her to not care that she is doing this activity. she needs to be under better care for her illness and taking her medication. so many people who suffer mental illnesses don't always take their medications. there are those who abuse even their own medications. she does need help. put your medications away!"

    "Question": "what is osteoarthritis?",
    "Answer": "osteoarthritis is a joint disease that mostly affects cartilage. cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over each other. it also helps absorb shock of movement. in osteoarthritis the top layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together. the rubbing causes pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also bone spurs may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space which causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis often have joint pain and reduced motion. unlike some other forms of arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joints and not internal organs. rheumatoid arthritis -- the second most common form of arthritis -- affects other parts of the body besides the joints. osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis."

    "Question": "what are pneumonia symptoms and signs?",
    "Answer": "most people who develop pneumonia initially have symptoms of a cold (upper respiratory infection for example sneezing sore throat cough) which are then followed by a high fever (sometimes as high as 104 f) shaking chills and a cough with sputum production. the sputum is usually discolored and sometimes bloody. depending on the location of the infection certain symptoms are more likely to develop. when the infection settles in the air passages cough and sputum tend to predominate the symptoms. in some the spongy tissue of the lungs that contain the air sacs is more involved. in this case oxygenation of the blood can be impaired along with stiffening of the lung which results in shortness of breath. at times the individual's skin color may change and become dusky or purplish (a condition known as \"cyanosis\") due to their blood being poorly oxygenated. the only pain fibers in the lung are on the surface of the lung in the area known as the pleura. chest pain may develop if the outer aspects of the lung close to the pleura are involved in the infection. this pain is usually sharp and worsens when taking a deep breath and is known as pleuritic pain or pleurisy. in other cases of pneumonia depending on the causative organism there can be a slow onset of symptoms. a worsening cough headaches and muscle aches may be the only symptoms. children and babies who develop pneumonia often do not have any specific signs of a chest infection but develop a fever appear quite ill and can become lethargic. elderly people may also have few symptoms with pneumonia."

    "Question": "i want to know if the flu-like symptoms i'm experiencing are from the valacyclovir i was prescribed. i was prescribed valacyclovir for treatment of hsv1. i had been taking 500mg twice daily for 4 days. on day 4 i went on a 2 mile run. i noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were somewhat swollen and tender. after sleeping for 6 hours i woke with flu symptoms. tight neck headache congestion nausea fever chills etc. i read online that these symptoms are also common side effects of the valacyclovir. is it likely that the medication in combination with the run just brought on an actual flu?",
    "Answer": "well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the flu--or influenza --can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot \"cause\" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well! in response to the answer above i never said the valacyclovir caused the flu the specific term i used was \"brought on\". also a common symptom of the flue (as i found online) is vomiting. so unless people vomit without feeling nauseous i dont see how nausea isnt a symptom of the flu. thanks for your response though."

    "Question": "what are some tips for grilling fruit?",
    "Answer": "some fruits hold up better to the grilling process than others due to their texture or simply their size. a few of my favorites are: pineapple peeled cored and cut into wedges rings or cubes peaches cored and cut in half mango cored and cut in half thick slices or cubes papaya slices or cubes firm bananas slice in half lengthwise pear cored and cut in half nectarines halved and pitted here are four beginner’s tips for grilling fruit: tip #1: for best results grill fresh fruit over low to medium heat to allow the fruit to cook all of the way through before getting the desirable grill marks on the outside. tip #2: a little canola oil cooking spray on the outside of the fruit keeps the fruit from sticking to the grill and promotes the browning process that creates the desirable grill marks (and flavors). tip #3: use fruits that hold up well to grilling and cut them into sizes that are easy to handle on a skewer (cubes) or by themselves (such as pineapple rings or peach halves) tip #4: grill fruit until it is slightly softened and light grill marks have formed. this can take about 3 minutes per side depending on the fruit."

    "Answer": "prostate cancer screening is controversial. some doctors and organizations recommend regular screening while others don't. the american cancer society says men should talk to their doctors about the benefits risks and limitations of prostate cancer screening before deciding whether to be tested. the group's guidelines make it clear that prostate-specific antigen (psa) blood testing should not occur unless this discussion happens. for most men at average risk screening is started at age 50. however some doctors recommend that men at higher risk of prostate cancer -- african-american men or those with a family history of prostate cancer -- start screening earlier. the american urological association recommends a first-time test at age 40 with the schedule of follow-up testing to be determined on an individual basis. if prostate cancer screening is done it involves a blood test and possibly a prostate exam by your doctor. whether or not you test is something you and your doctor must decide together."

    "Question": "why does diarrhea develop?",
    "Answer": "with diarrhea stools usually are looser whether or not the frequency of bowel movements is increased. this looseness of stool -- which can vary all the way from slightly soft to watery -- is caused by increased water in the stool. during normal digestion food is kept liquid by the secretion of large amounts of water by the stomach upper small intestine pancreas and gallbladder. food that is not digested reaches the lower small intestine and colon in liquid form. the lower small intestine and particularly the colon absorb the water turning the undigested food into a more-or-less solid stool with form. increased amounts of water in stool can occur if the stomach and/or small intestine secretes too much fluid the distal small intestine and colon do not absorb enough water or the undigested liquid food passes too quickly through the small intestine and colon for enough water to be removed. of course more than one of these abnormal processes may occur at the same time. for example some viruses bacteria and parasites cause increased secretion of fluid either by invading and inflaming the lining of the small intestine (inflammation stimulates the lining to secrete fluid) or by producing toxins (chemicals) that also stimulate the lining to secrete fluid but without causing inflammation. inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon from bacteria or from ileitis/colitis can increase the rapidity with which food passes through the intestines reducing the time that is available for absorbing water. conditions of the colon such as collagenous colitis can block the ability of the colon to absorb water. diarrhea generally is divided into two types acute and chronic. acute diarrhea lasts from a few days up to a week. chronic diarrhea can be defined in several ways but almost always lasts more than three weeks. it is important to distinguish between acute and chronic diarrhea because they usually have different causes require different diagnostic tests and require different treatment."

    "Answer": "yes. you can use probiotics but that will not solve the sore bottom. not all diaper rashes are the same. some are caused simply by the acidic irritation of having diarrhea but some can be yeast or even bacterial. each would be treated differently of course. since i can't diagnose your baby over the internet i can make a little suggestion that i use for my own patients. use a combination of an anti-yeast cream (over the counter. the pharmacist can help you pick one) and 1% hydrocortisone cream (for the inflammation). rub a small amount well in those sore areas and then cover this with a barrier cream or ointment (a&d desitin zinc oxide vaseline etc. ). change the diaper frequently and make sure you wipe of all traces of stool even if you have to give them a bath. if the area is bleeding or getting worse you will need to have it examined by the pediatrician."

    "Answer": "i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing \"bridge therapy\" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!"

    "Answer": "update from original post. saw ent had biopsy done and ct scan. biopsy was negative for cancer. swelling by ear is gone and one in neck is somewhat smaller. the ent wants me to have the lymph node (neck) removed and biopsied. i'm not in good health have intractable facial nerve pain from dental procedure (going thru nerve blocks for that) among other conditions. i want to wait on removing the lymph node as none of the tests showed a definitive problem. need some advice. probably will ask for a second opinion."

    "Question": "what other medical conditions cause high blood pressure? . i am 66 years old female and do not take any medications. i am not overweight. i workout 1 hour 3 days a week. i do not have a family history of high blood presure. i do not smoke or drink. i eat healthy meals and do not overuse salt. i am not under stress. up until this year my bp was 100/60 now it ranges from 100/60 to 140/90. what other medical conditions can cause bp problems?",
    "Answer": "well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the \"hypertension threshold \" but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise -- that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called \"essential hypertension. \" although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us. clinicallasers is a leading brand in laser equipment services and laser cutting fractional palomar aesthetic supplier companies laser equipment sales. clinicallasers provide complete laser equipment solutions according to your business needs. for know more visit to <link>"

    "Question": "can exercise help relieve some of the symptoms of pms?",
    "Answer": "research studies are still needed to demonstrate whether or not a true effect of exercise on the relief of pms symptoms exists. however evidence does show that exercise can help relieve some of the symptoms of pms. physical activity improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and anxiety. exercise is believed to release endorphins. endorphins contribute to euphoric feelings such as the \"runner's high\" experienced after prolonged exercise. endorphins are chemical messengers for nerves (neurotransmitters) that affect mood perception of pain memory retention and learning. aerobic exercise strengthens the heart and improves overall fitness by increasing the body's ability to use oxygen. swimming walking and dancing are low-impact aerobic activities. they avoid the muscle and joint pounding of more high-impact exercises such as jogging and jumping rope. benefits include cardiovascular fitness muscle tone weight loss or control decrease in fluid retention and increase in self-esteem."

    "Question": "my 76 year old dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer. his urologist said he needs to have a turp first. should he?",
    "Answer": "a turp stands for transurethral resection of the prostate. it is a procedure done through the penis/urethra where the urologist uses an instrument called a resectascope to remove prostate tissue that may be blocking the urinary chanel. it is the gold standard urologic surgery to relieve urinary obstruction from a prostate gland that is enlarged and blocking urinary flow out of the bladder. most board-certified urologists are expert at this procedure as it is one of the common operations that urologists frequenty perform. whether it should be done prior to radiation for prostate cancer is dependent on a number of factors: 1. if your dad has a lot of urinary symptoms such as hesitancy small stream and poor flow he may benefit from a turp. 2. if the urologist measures a high residual urine in the bladder after voiding then a turp may be needed. 3. if there are other complicating factors such as bladder stones or bleeding from an enlarged prostate then he may need a turp. in general his urologist should explain to your dad why he thinks a turp is needed. on the other hand most men do not rountinely need a turp before external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer."

    "Question": "what is the best low carb high protein diet? . in the past i have done the high protein diet however in my opinion there were not enough fruits or vegetables you could eat \"legally\". with some of the new ideas out there i think that has changed some. i would love to know which of the low carb/high protein diets is most recommended. and where to get the information about such a diet. thank you for any help you can give.",
    "Answer": "there doesn’t seem to be any bigger controversy in nutrition than discussing everyone’s opinion regarding what is the healthiest most ideal diet. my take on the matter is that there doesn’t have to be only one single diet or eating plan that everyone should follow; rather there may be many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and achieve a healthy diet. choosing the right diet can be difficult. the biggest factor that you have to first consider is what’s going to work well for you. try to figure out what you want to accomplish by changing your diet. is there a particular benefit or health outcome that you’re trying to achieve? certain diets may be better than others in providing different health outcomes so you first need to identify what you want to get out of your diet. the next part is to learn to set realistic expectations for yourself. will a certain diet be too restrictive for you or completely eliminate all the foods that you enjoy? do you think that you’ll feel hungry all the time or won’t be able to have anything to eat in social situations? you need to contemplate whether the eating plan that you’re looking at will actually work well for you. of course you may have to make some concessions and compromises with your diet sure but you also need to be realistic in what’s going to be achievable and manageable for you. a good way to start is to make slow and gradual changes to your eating habits. pick maybe one aspect of your diet that you would like to improve upon and work on changing that area first. once you’re successful there begin to make other changes until you finally reach a place where you’re comfortable with your diet. this strategy may work well to help ensure that you don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to make a drastic change or trying to do too much too soon. remember you need to approach this in a manner that you can sustain long term as part of a lifestyle change not as a short term solution to a problem. with all of that said to answer your question the paleo (caveman) diet has become quite popular. it’s a relatively low carbohydrate high protein diet that emphasizes grass-fed beef fish eggs fresh fruits and fresh vegetables; while it excludes dairy grains and refined/processed foods. see if this diet will work for you and feel free to explore other diets by reviewing diets a-z. personally i reccommend the paleo lifestyle. you can get all the information you need online you don't have to buy a book or anything. it is also called the caveman diet and it is pretty balanced. a website called the daily apple (google it) is helpful and also free. i find that eating paleo (or at least mostly paleo) is fairly balanced and fairly low carb. the main idea as you may know is to avoid eating things we wouldn't have had before agriculture. think vegetables lean meat fruit nuts seeds eggs animal based fats fish limited beans. it eliminates a lot of the junk we all eat and it helps you feel a lot fuller and more energetic. the biggest problem for me is cost. i use a somewhat modified version in that i add cheese and yogurt a somewhat pastoralist variation. for healthy dieting combination of slow carbs fast carbs & protein is necessary. so if we have meals containing these in proper combination it will help to loose weight naturally. i'm following a diet called food lovers fat loss system by tryfoodlovers is based on this principle. it helped me to loose fat in a healthy manner."

    "Question": "how can hsv 2 igg be positive but (igm)ifa be negative. i just received my herpes test results back and it says:. hsv 1 igg type specific 5. 00 h. and the bottom of the page it says: hsv 1/2 ab (igm) ifa w/rfl to titer. hsv 1 igm screen: negative. hsv 2 igm screen: negative. reference range: negative. can you please explain why one is poistive and one is negative?",
    "Answer": "herpes simplex virus 2 (hsv2) igm refers to current infection or outbreak. so this would be postive if you recently have had or currently have a herpetic outbreak. whereas hsv2 igg refers to a previous infection which means that you have been infected with the herpes virus and are therefore able to transmit the virus to someone else. once you have the virus like all viruses you will have it forever. essentially a positive igg and negative igm means you have the virus but not a current or recent outbreak. if you have frequent outbreaks or if your partner tests negative for herpes it is very important that you start suppresive antiviral therapy to prevent outbreaks and to decrease the risk of transmitting the virus. realize that even if you are on suppresive medication you can still pass the virus on to your partner so using a condom is also very important."

    "Answer": "the affordable care act (aca) which permanently reauthorizes the indian health service (ihs) makes several changes for the health care coverage of native americans. anyone with tribal membership is exempt from the “individual mandate”—the requirement to purchase insurance or pay a penalty. for those who choose to purchase insurance several options are now made available to native americans. american indians and alaskan natives may choose to receive coverage through ihs (as occurred before the aca); through medicare medicaid and chip (where eligible); or through health insurance exchanges. the aca allows tribes and tribal organizations to pay premiums on behalf of covered individuals in the exchanges. it prohibits cost sharing for native americans who earn below 300 percent of the federal poverty level ( $34 470 for one person and $70 650 for a family of four in 2013). any benefits paid for by tribes or ihs on behalf of an individual cannot be taxed as part of the individual’s income. any spending by ihs or a tribe on prescription drugs counts towards the individual’s medicare part d out-of-pocket threshold."

    "Answer": "ah gravity. it gets to all of us ladies sooner or later doesn't it? unfortunately i don't have good news for you. whether your breasts are naturally droopy due to age or whether you feel breastfeeding took an unkind toll the only way to lift those breasts back up is through breast lift surgery (also called mastopexy or mammoplasty). plastic surgeons and cosmetic surgeons perform this procedure which isn't usually covered by insurance. if you really don't want to go through surgery the only other way to lift the breast up a bit is to use some sort of padding (you can buy silicone bra inserts) and a very good bra. i recommend you see a certified bra fitter as a first step. the vast majority of women do not wear the correct size bra. a bra fitter will measure you to determine your real bra size and then help you choose a bra that gives you the best lift. a bra fitter may also be able to help you find an insert to help your breasts look as good as possible in a bra. in terms of various creams and potions you may see advertised to \"firm the breasts \" i want to mention there is absolutely no scientific evidence that they work -- and no reason they would work. droopy or saggy breasts are largely due to stretched-out skin. no cream or lotion can fix that. all the best to you!"

    "Answer": "if you were diagnosed with strep on monday and then started on antibiotics i doubt that you have spread it to your eyes. you could be allergic to the antibiotic that your doctor gave you but you would know whether or not you are allergic if you have been on any antibiotics in the past. if so then the eye problem i believe is a separate thing altogether. go and call your doctor back and let them know of when your eyes started itching and oozing. i am not sure of the antibiotics and whether or not they will help your eyes and your eyes should not be oozing anything and especially something green. i would have called my doctor back and then go to the emergency room because the longer you wait you might have damaged your eyes. penicillin is a good antibiotic but as far as the oozing out of your eyes it may not be the right one. so please call your doctor and let them know and see what they say. i do hope you get to feeling better. please keep us informed of your situation. and please let us know if you can help in anyway. thank you."

    "Answer": "yes you can do this but remember that a fever -- especially a mild one in a child -- is actually helpful in fighting a virus. a fever is the one of the body's most powerful immune responses so it is not necessary or even medically recommended to treat a fever. you can however treat the discomfort associated with a fever so if your little one seems uncomfortable just use the acetaminophen or ibuprofen products that you mentioned. mucinex is a mucous-thinning agent and will not necessarily help a cough. loosened mucous can drain down a child's throat at night and actually make a cough worse so please keep that in mind. during the day mucinex is certainly okay. use saline nose sprays/drops and use a cool mist humidifier. colds last about a week but some symptoms like runny nose or cough can hang on longer. don't over-treat a cold."

    "Question": "what medications and treatments are available to treat hyperthyroidism?",
    "Answer": "antithyroid medicine is often used for hyperthyroidism because it works more quickly than radioactive iodine therapy. radioactive iodine therapy destroys part or all of the thyroid gland depending on the dosage used. but antithyroid medicine does not cause permanent thyroid damage. you may take antithyroid medicine before you have radioactive iodine treatment or surgery-to bring your metabolism to normal to make you feel better or to reduce the chances of more serious problems. antithyroid medicine does control hyperthyroidism in many people. but the medicine does have some drawbacks. you have to take the medicine for at least 1 year. your symptoms may come back after you stop taking it. and then you have to start taking antithyroid medicine again or try a different treatment. there are some rare side effects from the medicine ranging from a rash to a low white blood cell count which can make it hard for your body to fight infection. your doctor may prescribe additional medicines to treat symptoms caused by hyperthyroidism such as rapid heartbeat or dry eyes. these medicines can help you feel better while you wait for another treatment to begin to work. medication choices antithyroid medicines additional medicines what to think about antithyroid medicine may or may not make your hyperthyroidism permanently go away. somewhere between 30% and 50% of people will have their hyperthyroidism go away (go into remission ) after taking antithyroid medicine for 1 or 2 years. 3 antithyroid medicine works best if you have mild hyperthyroidism if this is the first time you are being treated for graves' disease if you are younger than 50 or if your thyroid gland is only swollen a little bit (small goiter). it is not used for thyroiditis. antithyroid medicine is used instead of radioactive iodine if you are pregnant breast-feeding or trying to become pregnant. children are treated with antithyroid medicine because experts do not know if radioactive iodine treatment is safe for children. treating children with antithyroid medicine is challenging. it is hard to know how much medicine they need when they are growing so quickly. your doctor may prescribe low doses of thyroid hormone medicine to take with your antithyroid medicine so that your thyroid hormone levels do not get too low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Question": "will calcium supplement help to heal broken bones faster? what will speed the healing? . 2 broken bones in the right hand of my sixteen year old son. the break is vertical so less likely to shift.",
    "Answer": "i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster. after all bones are made of calcium right? so feeding them calcium should speed up healing. unfortunately that's not how it works. unless you have a pre-existing calcium deficiency (not likely in an otherwise healthy 16-year-old boy) taking calcium will not help your bones heal. the process of bone healing is called \"remodeling. \" your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place. this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule. for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks. unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out. what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture. resting the hand (to keep the fractures stable) will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal. wishing you well! this answer is true. most fractures especially of bigger bones will take 6 to 8 weeks. smaller bones like those of the fingers and/or wrist will only take 4-5 weeks. just gotta baby them. the body is made to heal itself. just let it"

    "Question": "what are complex migrains. i had an incident at work where my right arm went numb i had problem speaking for a few seconds and felt like i might faint. i was in the hospital for 5 days undergoing stroke tests. i was diagnosed with complex migrains and was told that it produces stroke symptoms. what exactly or as close as i can get is a complex migraine and how can i treat it without medication?",
    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you went through such a scary episode but i'm glad it was a migraine and not a stroke! \"complex migraine \" is a term used to identify rare types of migraine headaches that have specific symptoms not usually associated with a common or classic migraine. for example a classic migraine usually starts with a visual disturbance (called an \"aura\") and then proceeds to a painful headache. a complex migraine may fall under one of these types: hemiplegic which includes temporary paralysis or weakness on one side of the body (often mimicking a stroke) retinal which includes loss of vision in one eye basilar artery which usually affects young women and includes symptoms such as confusion and difficulty speaking ophthalmoplegic which includes pain and paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye status migrainosus which is a severe migraine that lasts for days it sounds like you may have experienced a hemiplegic migraine or a basilar artery migraine. just because you had one migraine doesn't mean it will ever happen again. that's the tricky thing about these headaches. often doctors will wait to treat a patient until they've had multiple migraines over a course of time. that may be why you were sent home without any treatment. if you have any questions about your migraine experience i suggest you follow up with your primary health care provider. he or she can help you understand what happened and if you need treatment. wishing you all the best! i had basically the same thing happen to me. i was driving in high holiday traffic during december on the bqe in nyc for my nieces' baptism. all of a sudden i was going numb on left side of my face and scalp as well as feeling weak but had no pain. then bam my eyesight went and came back. i panicked and managed to pull over. i had no idea what was happening to me. i thought i was having a stroke and my heart was racing because i panicked. so it felt like a heart attack. my boyfriend drove us the rest of the way and i went to the er to be checked out. i had an mri cat scan echo blood drawn for tests etc. i was vamped pricked and prodded by 4 different doctors. then the neurologist saw me and said he thinks i had an atypical complex migraine headache and a mild panic attack. i was told to avoid several things. all of which lead to migraine headaches and for me most are not avoidable but some are. thing such as chocolate too much sleep too little sleep caffeine stress alcohol smoking extreme fatigue skipping meals and bright or flickering lights. you better believe that the things this doctor listed pretty much was like a check list for my 6 hour drive. i worked a 10 hour shift skipped dinner drank 4 20 oz cups of coffee and had a chocolate bar all while arguing over navigation issues with the bf. also was stressing because i was the god mother and if we were late to the church my sister would never forgive me. i was also surprised to learn that when i would get stressed at work i would get a mild headache with a tick or fluttering eye muscle and \"floaters\" in my eye and that it was a migraine but with out the pain. i now keep a headache or migraine diary and try to figure out what my triggers are. the biggest ones for me are sleep stress and caffeine. just know that you aren't alone in this and you might never even have another one again. it helps to just take care of yourself and avoid caffeine/stress."

    "Question": "i have to force myself to eat i havent ate much in a week. so far this week i have ate a half bowl of oatmeal two sandwiches and some fries and its thursday my parents are worried i think and so am i. i am overweight and 13 so could it be my brain saying \"hey fatty stop eating\"? any help would be much appreciated! thanks",
    "Answer": "be happy of your body but also believe it is what you make of it! not eating is not a reaction by your brain instead eating is encouraged in order to meet the vitamins nutrients and protein your body needs to get through the day and promotes brain functions. not eating can also cause problems to the functions of your hypothalamus. if there has been any new medications in your regimen maybe that is a problem. i would encourage an exercise program as it has helped me in a daily routine of eating. exercise is necessary among individuals whether you are overweight or not due to the release of endorphins which is food for your brain and makes you feel better. i was able to trim 6% body fat in 3 months due to a steady exercise program of 6 days a week and i am even eating 5 meals a day to keep my calorie intake high. i would suggest the first week starting slower with 3 days a week in order to loosen your muscles. stretching is also a very important key to a successful workout in which should be done before and after. the best advice is to not give up on yourself. losing weight and eating healthy takes time to adjust but noticing results will help your morale and motives on a daily basis. your diet is the most important thing and needs adjusting in a more strict regimen of what and when to eat. if you begin exercising running for a half hour will burn roughly 300-500 calories depending on speed. keep in mind that is simply a large fry from mcdonalds. completely cut all of those greasy foods out and begin eating healthier to feel better. boosting metabolism is a great way to start so drinking a coffee or green tea in the morning is a great way to do so. no soda. milk is necessary for calcium but stay away from the fats! try almond milk for lower fat content and higher calcium water is a great thing to drink as it keeps you hydrated and well. breakfast: possible one-a-day for key nutrients and vitamins otherwise get cereal with vitamins and nutrients. my favorite is post grape nuts which has a lot of the vitamins required for a daily intake along with protein. oatmeal is also another good way to jump start your day. eggs are a great breakfast food for the proteins and omega-3. lunch: my personal go to is a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread greek yogurt and banana. tuna fish sandwich is also a good lunch meal dinner: be creative! pasta and chicken that is not breaded is very good for glutamine and starch for energy. quinoa is my personal favorite as it contains every essential amino acid (really good cooked in chicken brother instead of water). rice is another good one and i also prefer fish. these foods and more such as split peas and soy beans will help you keep a healthy balanced diet which will lower your sugar and saturated fat intake. i really hope this helps as it has changed my life greatly!"

    "Question": "do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon?",
    "Answer": "this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain. so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they -- they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list. because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably don't need. i would like to be able to find a more non-drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake. so we want to make sure that that patient understands that. the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need. so that's where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this? this happens all the time in the pharmacy. i can't tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know? well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor doesn't know about this one. everyone needs to know about it. that's why that medication list is so important. not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments. that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer heating formula in the microwave will not destroy the nutrients but it is not recommended. the reason is it does not heat the milk evenly potentially resulting in milk that is hot in some areas and cold in others. a better way to warm up formula is by running it under warm water or placing it in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. just make sure the bottle is not to hot when you give it to your baby. congratulations on your baby"

    "Answer": "yes it's true some who are under stress or who have had a problem with choking on food in the past sometimes experience problems with swallowing. it's very much like developing a phobia. first something frightening or painful happens and this sets up a situation for fear in the future. then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. you eat you're afraid you'll choke and then you have problems swallowing. the more it happens the stronger the fear is reinforced. for some people it amounts to a situation where they can only swallow liquids. i suggest that you look for a licensed certified biofeedback specialist who can work with you on this."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. as a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse i've worked with many hidradenitis patients so i understand how painful and embarrassing it can be. i'm afraid in general i don't have good news for you. hidradenitis suppurativa is a difficult insidious disease. it basically is an infection of the apocrine sweat glands and only occurs where these glands are located in the skin: the armpits groin perineal area perianal area and areola (area around the nipple). hidradenitis in not curable. in general patients go through mild outbreaks that are treated with antibiotics or other therapies. in my experience hidradenitis almost always recurs however. the only permanent solution to the problem is surgery. surgery is usually reserved for intractable cases where the lesions won't heal and stay open and oozing for weeks or even months. i'm not sure what your doctor is planning to inject you with. botox (botulinum toxin) is not indicated for hidradenitis and there's no evidence it would be useful. botox is used to treat excessive sweating which is called hyperhidrosis. it's possible your doctor is planning to inject corticosteroids into the lesions because this is a fairly common treatment when the disease is in the milder stage. in general hidradenitis patients should focus on keeping the apocrine gland areas very clean with gentle daily washing using an antibacterial cleanser and cleansing only with bare fingers. it's helpful to avoid any sort of skin trauma in susceptible areas and even washing with a washcloth can possibly trigger an outbreak. i wish you all the best with this condition. had simalar problem and could not get any answers. researched simalar conditions for over two years. finally found a possibile answer (not a cure but keeps them at bay). cut out all pork out of your diet. read all labels and take caution no chips fried in pork fat no lunch meat no canned meats etc. etc. it took me about three months for the bacteria enzymes ? what ever it is in pork to get purged out of my system and it worked. have not had any reoccurances since then. it may be worth a shot ain't gonna hurt. good luck. back in the 60's i had boils. after many months of suffering my doctor sent the pus from the boil to a lab & had a vaccine made from it. i took injections of the vaccine for approximately 6 weeks & i haven't had a boil since. can this not be done for those suffering with boils today? l. wilborn this condition started 5 years ago and exacerbated with shaving. it is extremely painful cannot be improved with excessive hygiene is embarrassing has resulted in multiple scars and had a psychological effect on me also. i just want it to go away! sometimes the boils last 2-3 weeks. can it be permanently cured or go into a \"remission period\"? it's so gross!"

    "Question": "have herpes why when i try to go to sleep does the area have a fire burning feeling just discomfort til then. 5 days in",
    "Answer": "i don't know why but over the 20+ years i've had it - i've noticed as soon as i change out of my clothing from the day i have this problem. i just figured it must have something to do with the area suddenly being exposed to oxygen. i've learned to not wear tight jeans during a breakout to avoid agitation. i have found it comforting to gently wash the area before bed with just water and a clean washcloth. another thing i've done for relief if it's unbearable which my husband came up with is: get chamomile tea bags; steep 1 in a bowl of hot water. lie on a folded towel you don't mind staining (or you'll \"make tea\" on your sheets); place the tea bag on the sore; re-steep and continue until the water's cold. it will help and relax you so you can sleep. but if the sore is already burst open and the chamomile agitates the skin - discontinue. then wear fresh all cotton white briefs underwear to bed (during a breakout even if you normally don't). and finally the zovirax cream is wonderful - just a little bit a few times a day / or of course following your dr's. instructions for dosing / right where the sore is -- and don't scratch! i don't take the zovirax pills as a preventative anymore. they make me feel a bit cruddy so with a mild breakout i just use the cream. but if i have swollen glands in my groin and/or have that \"just kicked in the crotch and hit by a truck\" feeling -- i take the pills for 3 days plus the cream. of course during a breakout we abstain from sex due to pain anyway. but for a while after healed use condoms! in 18 years i have not infected my husband. best wishes i know life with this illness is a drag but it is manageable & after a while doesn't seem like the end of the world. over time you should go long periods without breakouts. stress and lack of rest can bring them on so take good care of you. k"

    "Question": "what are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?",
    "Answer": "people with bipolar disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that occur in distinct periods called \"mood episodes. \" an overly joyful or overexcited state is called a manic episode and an extremely sad or hopeless state is called a depressive episode. sometimes a mood episode includes symptoms of both mania and depression. this is called a mixed state. people with bipolar disorder also may be explosive and irritable during a mood episode. extreme changes in energy activity sleep and behavior go along with these changes in mood. it is possible for someone with bipolar disorder to experience a long-lasting period of unstable moods rather than discrete episodes of depression or mania. a person may be having an episode of bipolar disorder if he or she has a number of manic or depressive symptoms for most of the day nearly every day for at least one or two weeks. sometimes symptoms are so severe that the person cannot function normally at work school or home."

    "Question": "my husband switched to fentanyl patches after taking oxycontin for two years. when can he expect relief from his pain?",
    "Answer": "so pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that it’s not working i have to ask him a few questions. i want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way. sometimes patients don't understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body. they also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they shouldn't leave the other patch on and then put on another one. so i tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch. i will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it. now my skin is going to be different than your skin. so patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect. so if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass. in this case i also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company. because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch. also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that. so it's a step wise approach and individualized therapy. the physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it wasn't really treating his pain. so the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient."

    "Answer": "your doctor is being thorough. trying to give you a more definite answer based on the results of both tests. there is always a cause to be concerned so your doctor is trying to alleviate any diagnostic uncertainty. as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i've learned from my experiences. i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions. mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics. dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri. each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses. it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety. i believe in prevention in all things. i believe in early detection saves lives. most lesions turn out to be cysts. however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better. if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome. also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment. mammograms do save lives! i found my tumor myself through self-exam. i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms. my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found. mammography saved her life! mammography also brings relief and joy! two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free!"

    "Question": "is falafel good for me?",
    "Answer": "falafel a middle eastern dish is high in protein and popular with vegetarians. it’s usually made from chick peas shaped into a ball and served in a pita pocket or on folded flat bread. my family members are fans too and we love getting falafel pita sandwiches at the farmer’s market in town. we are such falafel fans that i want to be able to make them at home too. they are actually easy to make ahead of time and can be used as a fun lunch entree for grown-ups and kids alike. falafel are usually deep fried but you can lighten them up by either cooking them in a nonstick frying pan with a controlled amount of canola or olive oil. or you can lightly coat the outside of the falafel balls with canola or olive oil cooking spray and bake them until nicely browned. here’s a recipe for the baked version. ingredients 1/3 cup dry bulgur wheat 15 ounce can garbanzo beans (chickpeas) drained and rinsed (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup chopped green onions 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1 large egg higher omega-3 if available 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons minced or chopped garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional) 1/2 cup finely ground italian-style or plain breadcrumbs canola or olive oil cooking spray preparation 1. place bulgur in a small bowl and pour in boiling water to cover it by 2 inches. let soak for about 15 minutes. 2. in the bowl of a food processor combine 3/4 cup of the cooked bulgur (remove the bulgur from the bowl with a slotted spoon) with garbanzo beans green onions whole wheat flour egg parsley garlic cumin and red pepper flakes if desired. pulse scraping the sides of the bowl after about 5 seconds until the mixture is thick enough to form into balls. 3. place breadcrumbs in a small bowl. use a tablespoon measure to scoop a level tablespoon of falafel dough and drop it into the breadcrumbs; roll it around in the breadcrumbs to lightly coat. place the coated falafel on a sheet of waxed paper on the counter. repeat with the remaining falafel dough. cover the falafels loosely and let them stand for 1 hour. (you can skip this waiting period if you don’t have the time). 4. preheat oven to 450-degrees. while still on the waxed paper coat the tops of the falafels generously with cooking spray. lay the falafels cooking-spray-side down on a cookie sheet. spray the tops of the falafels generously with more cooking spray. 5. bake until golden brown about 22 minutes. while they are baking you can whip up a batch of tahini dressing. yield: makes about 5 servings. nutritional analysis per serving: 182 calories 9 g protein 31 g carbohydrate 3 g fat . 4 g saturated fat . 4 g monounsaturated fat . 4 g polyunsaturated fat 42 mg cholesterol 6 g fiber 464 mg sodium. calories from fat: 14 percent. omega-3 fatty acids =. 1 gram omega-6 fatty acids =. 3 gram. tahini dressing ingredients 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste or butter) room temperature and stirred to smooth 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon minced or chopped garlic 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon tabasco sauce (optional) 2 teaspoons honey preparation 1. place all the dressing ingredients in a blender or small food processor bowl or small mixing bowl. 2. beat or pulse until well blended (it should look whipped). 3. place dressing in a bowl and serve or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. yield: makes 1/2 cup. nutritional analysis per tablespoon: 50 calories 2 g protein 3 g carbohydrate 3. 5 g fat . 5 g saturated fat 1. 5 g monounsaturated fat 1. 5 g polyunsaturated fat 0 mg cholesterol . 4 g fiber 38 mg sodium. calories from fat: 63 percent. omega-3 fatty acids = 0 gram omega-6 fatty acids = 1. 5 grams."

    "Answer": "if your cough is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever chills sore throat or other symptoms you should be seen by a physician. likewise if you are coughing up phlegm (sputum) that is thick green or excessive in amount you should be seen by a doctor. in addition if you identify things that trigger your cough such as dander or pollen this may be more than a simple cough and should be investigated. finally it is common sense that anyone with diabetes (or without diabetes for that matter) should not smoke. there are over-the-counter remedies available without sugar and if in doubt your pharmacist should be able to point you in the right direction. in particular benylin adult is sugar- and alcohol- free and provides some relief from a non-productive (dry) cough. this should not be used in conjunction with drugs called maois or in those who are pregnant or nursing. the active ingredient in this formula is dextromethorphan and it is ppa free. another possibility is robitussin cf. this preparation has been re-formulated to be ppa free and now contains pseudoephedrine instead. the other active ingredient is dextromethorphan and together this preparation helps to suppress cough and also helps to expectorate (which means it makes the bringing up of phlegm easier). robitussin cf is sugar-free and alcohol-free. it should be used with caution in patients with high blood pressure or heart disease and should be avoided in patients on maois. this medication is not recommended for pregnant or nursing mothers. there are other stronger medications available but these should be taken on the advice of a physician after a full assessment. it there is no improvement in symptoms within 5 days you should be seen by your primary doctor for further evaluation."

    "Answer": "keloid scars do happen in some people more than others and it typically is a genetic potential that makes you prone to that. what we use to treat keloids are a combination of two things. often simply cortisone injections into the scars themselves over time it takes a few treatments usually done at four-six week intervals will help flatten those scars. there will still be a scar but it will be smoother and flatter. the other thing that we can use is a pulsed dye laser that targets the blood vessel in the scar and helps it flatten. so those two sometimes used together can help that area heal and become smoother softer and flatter more quickly. over time you may have to repeat the treatment because sometimes keloids reform over time. but typically after a few treatments you will see the area get better and then maybe once a year or so you will have to retreat."

    "Answer": "most couples are able to become pregnant within the first 12 months of having regular unprotected sex. if after a year of trying a woman under 35 is still not pregnant then a checkup is in order to see if there is a problem. there are many reasons why a couple may have a problem getting pregnant. sometimes it is a health issue for the man and sometimes it is a health issue for the woman. a woman can have a problem with her hormones or with her womb or fallopian tubes. a man may not have enough healthy sperm. sometimes both the man and woman can have an infertility problem. just because you are not pregnant yet does not mean that you can’t have a healthy baby. you should make an appointment with your gynecologist and have your partner see his doctor or urologist to see what may be the cause. your doctor will most likely give you a prenatal vitamin to be sure that your pregnancy gets a healthy start. in the meantime make sure you are eating a healthy diet. get enough exercise. and avoid tobacco alcohol and any drugs that have not been prescribed by your doctor. for more information check out this link to webmd’s infertility and reproduction health center. <link>"

    "Answer": "hi there are many sex killers and he has 3 of them heavy smoking heavy drinking of alcohol and stress sorry double stress. so can you see the answers then? he must stop drinking get rid of the smoking google natural ways out of stress you should find some help there. but the drinking and smoking this is all down to self control. but you also need to look at what he eats if he is a fast food and junk food eater then these also need to go to much high salt and sugars get him to eat healthy. these would be a good start save going for the viagra there are natural herbs that would be far better for him it can be done i did. do hope this helps you. good luck ps if he's on any meds some of these are also sex killers just google each drug with ed side effects you should find things that way."

    "Question": "when i bend over clear fluid leaks out of my left nostril it happend last year but it stopped now it happend this week. i have a deviated septum and mucus is always in my throat witch i have to spit contently i am terrified it could be a csf leak i had a mri of the head and it came back clear now it dose not happen all the time i can bend down now and it wont happen it maybe happens twice or once every year right now i have headaches and head pressure on my nose and face and back of head with headaches im also dizzy saw ents and doctors and blood test all came back fine doctors think its anxiet coulditbeallergies",
    "Answer": "you were wise to get this situation checked out because it is possible for a person to leak cerebrospinal fluid (csf) through a nostril and this is a dangerous situation that can lead to a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain. however since you've had a battery of tests done that have shown the fluid leaking from your nose is not csf then you can rest assured your brain is fine. the fluid coming from your nose must be normal mucus. many people (myself included) suffer from a chronically runny nose. clear fluid coming from the nose can indeed be caused by allergies. there also is an interesting condition called 'gustatory rhinitis ' which is fancy talk for getting a runny nose while eating. since your runny nose comes and goes it does sound like it could be seasonal allergies. only your health care providers can solve this mystery for you. i wish you all the best."

    "Answer": "based on your age your target heart rate would be between 82bpm and 114 bpm. this is based solely on your age. if you want to calculate this based on your fitness level you can use the karvonen formula: target heart rate = ((max hr - resting hr) × %intensity) + resting hr take your pulse at rest subtract this from max hr (220 minus your age) multiply this by. 60 and. 70 to get your target heart rate range."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer depending on the size of the stone stones in the kidney can move into the ureter (the tube between the kidney and the bladder). if it moves to the neck of the kidney it will be painful as well. most people who have had kidney stones myself included will agree that kidney stones hurts. a lot! when you are having a 9 on a 10 scale of pain how do we know you had just one kidney stone? the one causing the pain could have been the size of a grain of salt and still cause incredible pain on its journey to the bladder. i am guessing but i suspect that you passed a tiny one before the er even did your ct scan."

    "Question": "are insurers still able to deny coverage to individuals because of pre-existing conditions?",
    "Answer": "unfortunately the answer to this question is yes. as of right now if you apply for insurance on the private market (as opposed to getting it through your job) insurance companies will look into your medical history and can deny you coverage based on what they find. in some instances you may be extended a plan in spite of a pre-existing health condition but will be charged more for it. as of january 2014 however the affordable care act (the health reform law) will prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage on the basis of their medical history. in addition carriers won't be allowed to charge people different rates for health insurance because of their health status or gender. if you've shopped for health insurance on the private market and have been denied coverage don't give up just yet. some minor health issues (think well-controlled asthma migraines etc. but not diabetes or heart disease however) won't be declined by every insurance company."

    "Question": "what other factors may play a role in atopic dermatitis?",
    "Answer": "in addition to irritants and allergens other factors -- such as emotional issues temperature and climate and skin infections -- can affect atopic dermatitis. although the disease itself is not caused by emotional factors or personality it can be exacerbated by stress anger and frustration. interpersonal problems or major life changes such as divorce job changes or the death of a loved one can also make the disease worse. often emotional stress seems to prompt a flare of the disease. bathing with harsh soaps without proper moisturizing afterward is a common factor that triggers a flare of atopic dermatitis. typical recommendations include using a very gentle soap-free cleanser or milder soap the \"three-minute rule\" of lubricating with a rich moisturizer within three minutes of drying off after a bath or shower is particularly helpful for many patients. the low humidity of winter or the dry year-round climate of some geographic areas can intensify the disease as can overheated indoor areas and long or hot baths and showers. sweating and chilling can also induce an attack in some people. bacterial infections can also prompt or increase the severity of atopic dermatitis. if a patient experiences a sudden onset of illness the doctor may check for a viral infection (such as herpes simplex) or fungal infection (such as ringworm or athlete's foot)."

    "Answer": "hi got this piece of info from the uk’s nhs. it’s the uk’s health service so all info is pretty good and correct. increased risks taking ibuprofen particularly at high doses over long periods of time can increase your risk of: stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is disturbed heart attacks – when the blood supply to the heart is blocked in women long-term use of ibuprofen might be associated with reduced fertility. this is usually reversible when you stop taking ibuprofen. if you accidentally take an extra dose of ibuprofen miss out the next dose so you are not taking more than the recommended maximum dose for a 24-hour period. so now do you think its best to stay at what you doing the shot would be far better for you and you would be off the drugs being drug free is far better for you and your health but do stay away from golf tell you get it sorted out. good luck"

    "Answer": "hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system the body’s natural defense system. without a strong immune system the body has trouble fighting off disease. both the virus and the infection it causes are called hiv. white blood cells are an important part of the immune system. hiv invades and destroys certain white blood cells called cd4+ cells. if too many cd4+ cells are destroyed the body can no longer defend itself against infection. the last stage of hiv infection is aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). people with aids have a low number of cd4+ cells and get infections or cancers that rarely occur in healthy people. these can be deadly. but having hiv does not mean you have aids. even without treatment it takes a long time for hiv to progress to aids-usually 10 to 12 years. if hiv is diagnosed before it becomes aids medicines can slow or stop the damage to the immune system. with treatment many people with hiv are able to live long and active lives. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "ultimately she is responsible for her own mental health and life. bipolar doesn't go away ever and she will have to learn to monitor and control herself so that her moods don't run her life. there are 12-step programs for adult children of alcoholics (and other dysfunction such as perfectionism hyper-religiosity and any kind of abuse). she needs to know that her own out-of-control tendencies (anger indiscriminate sex any addiction including shopping among others) are not acceptable behaviors (learn to communicate without fighting) and start working on herself. you can be supportive but you can't do the work for her. she is not good mother material so i would avoid even thinking about it until she has proven she can get herself under control. a bipolar person is unstable and instability is not what a child needs to thrive in all ways including emotionally."

    "Question": "what is cystic fibrosis?",
    "Answer": "cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic progressive condition that affects the body's respiratory and digestive systems. it is due to a gene defect. people who have cf produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs and leads to repeated lung and sinus infections as well as difficulty breathing. the thick mucus also obstructs the ducts of the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines. because so little food is absorbed children with cf have difficulty gaining and maintaining weight. cf also affects the reproductive systems of both males and females. females with cf may have difficulty getting pregnant. males with cf are almost always sterile because they produce relatively few or no sperm."

    "Question": "how can type 1 diabetes be prevented?",
    "Answer": "preventing type 1 diabetes currently there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes but ongoing studies are exploring ways to prevent diabetes in those who are most likely to develop it. people who have a parent brother or sister with type 1 diabetes and are willing to participate in one of these studies should talk with their doctors. they may want to be tested for islet cell antibodies because if they have these antibodies they are more likely to get diabetes. vaccines have not been found to contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes. 4 children who are at risk for developing diabetes still need to get the recommended immunizations. see the childhood immunization schedule recommended by the u. s. advisory committee on immunization practices the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians. preventing diabetes complications people with type 1 diabetes can help prevent or delay the development of complications such as eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve diseases by keeping their blood sugar near normal levels. they also need regular medical checkups to detect early signs of complications. if complications are treated early the damage may be stopped slowed or possibly reversed. people who have other health problems along with diabetes such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol need to treat those conditions. also not smoking can reduce the risk of complications. having other health problems can increase the risk for complications from diabetes. preventing flu and pneumococcal disease people who have diabetes should have a flu shot every year and a pneumococcal vaccine. usually people need only one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine. but doctors sometimes recommend a second dose for some people especially if they have a long-term disease. talk with your doctor about whether you need a second dose. the pneumococcal vaccine helps prevent infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria. people with diabetes especially those who have heart or kidney disease are at high risk for complications hospitalization and death from flu and pneumococcal disease. 5 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

    "Answer": "unfortunately there are no \"natural\" or alternative treatments available at this time with enough research to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness to reduce the risk of broken bones in people with osteoporosis. preventing broken bones in a person with osteoporosis requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates the following four critical components: 1) a prescribed osteoporosis medication; 2) calcium 3) vitamin d; and 4) exercise. calcium vitamin d and exercise alone are insufficient for preventing fractures in people with significant bone loss (osteoporosis). in addition to calcium and vitamin d there are other vitamins and minerals that are important for bone health. for example magnesium and vitamin k are often added to \"natural\" supplements for bone health. research studies however show that the amount of magnesium and vitamin k that is necessary for bone health can be obtained from a well-balanced healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. there are many supplements on the market that claim to treat osteoporosis naturally. it's important to be cautious as many such products lack sufficient evidence to show that they positively impact bone health reduce the risk of fractures and are safe."

    "Question": "i had my genital warts removed by surgical excision 3 days ago how do i know if they're infected. . i have been cleaning with soap and water 2-3 times a day and apply bacitracin as well. i did not get stitches he used silver nitrate to stop the bleeding. in these places it looks as if they're oozing with puss but it seems more gooey and doesn't come off.",
    "Answer": "it sounds like you're doing a good job caring for your post-surgical wounds. be sure to keep following all the post-surgical instructions you were given. the risk of infection for your procedure is relatively low. the classic signs of infection are: fever loss of appetite feeling like you're coming down with the flu severe pain/swelling/bleeding in the surgical area. if the \"gooey pus\" you're seeing is yellowish in color chances are good this is not an infection. as the skin heals itself it tends to over-produce protein cells. these cells look kind of yellow gooey and sticky. if that's what you're seeing it's probably a normal part of the healing process. don't scrub these cells off. just gently wash with warm soapy water and rinse well. if your surgeon told you to use antibiotic ointment like bacitracin then continue to do so according to the post-surgical instructions you were given. as your wounds heal you also can apply a vitamin a & vitamin d ointment (often used for diaper rash) to help your skin heal. if you develop a fever or any other signs of a true infection contact your healthcare provider immediately."

    "Answer": "if you are a young person looking for health insurance or a parent looking on behalf of your child here are some options to explore: your parents' plan students who are about to graduate college without a job supplying health insurance should look to join or remain on their parents' health plan if that's an option. graduating from college and losing existing insurance coverage is considered a qualifying event meaning you'd be eligible to sign up now rather than having to wait for the fall when most companies conduct open enrollment. college plans not all colleges offer a student health plan but many do. and some colleges require students to prove they have some form of health insurance. if you're a college student or the parent of one student health plans may offer an affordable route to coverage. most of these plans currently have low benefit caps which means you'll very quickly bump up against the limits of what the plan will pay for leaving you with a big bill if you go to the emergency room or get very sick. the private market for a young reasonably healthy person the private insurance market may offer some reasonable and affordable options. the federal government's web site healthcare. gov is a good place to start your search. to compare plans and purchase online or with the help of a licensed broker you can also log on to ehealthinsurance. com or vimo. com. for more information about the health insurance options available to college grads check out the young invincibles' tool kit available on its website."

    "Question": "is she pregnant? . i am 18 years old. i had sex with my girlfriend yesterday at 5pm(bangladesh gmt+6). it was her period time. her period was started 1day ago. i didn't use a condom. after having sex she taken pregnancy stop pills \"no risk\" which was suggested to take after 12 hours after having sex. and she taken another pills after 12 hours. but no blooding was held and also her period stopped. now please tell me is she pregnant? and have i possibility of hiv(aids)?",
    "Answer": "assuming your story is accurate the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is very very small. ovulation occurs about 2 weeks after menstruation so this was not her \"fertile\" time. there is still a very remote chance that some of your sperm (it only takes one sperm out of millions) will remain viable if she ovulates early. you are very foolish for not using a condom so don't ever put your girlfriend at risk ever again. condoms also help prevent sexually-transmitted diseases. if your girlfriend was hiv positive than yes you are now at risk as well. if she does not have hiv or aids you are not at risk. if you are going to be having sex in the future please do so safely. use a condom."

    "Question": "can being in an un-compatible relationship trigger migraines?",
    "Answer": "stress including anger can trigger migraines. i am a migraine sufferer and i find that during periods in my life where i argue more often or am otherwise emotionally stressed by relationship troubles i'm more likely to have more migraine episodes. under emotional stress the sympathetic nervous system releases stress hormones and these can result in changes that set off migraines. since vasodilation in the brain is one of the causes of migraines and anger specifically causes vasodilation in the brain it is an emotion often associated with stress-induced migraines. other migraine triggers can include certain foods (chocolate alcohol) and environmental triggers such as mildew or perfume."

    "Question": "what happens in co-infection with hepatitis b virus and hiv?",
    "Answer": "the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis b virus are transmitted in similar ways and it is not uncommon for an individual to have both infections. persons with hiv who acquire hepatitis b are more likely to become chronically infected with hepatitis b than persons who do not have hiv. the reason for this is thought to be that hiv suppresses the immune system and impairs the ability of the body to eliminate the hepatitis b virus. some nucleoside ucleotide analogues (a class of antiretroviral drugs) are used to treat both hiv and hepatitis b although dosages may vary in the two different infections. stopping one of these agents when the hiv regimen is adjusted may cause hepatitis to flare."

    "Answer": "most helpful answer hi depending on what time of your cycle you had sex would determine if you get pregnant his high sperm count would not matter. but timing dose if you had unprotected sex on say day 12 of your cycle (it works this way day one is the day you start your period) around day 14 is your egg release day male sperm takes 3 days to reach your womb and can live a lot longer than your egg will so hopefully they meet at the right time so can you see how its all down to timing and not so much high sperm count. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Question": "how is orthostatic hypotension diagnosed?",
    "Answer": "the key to the diagnosis is a good history and physical examination. the health care practitioner will want to know the circumstances that are associated with the symptoms of lightheadedness or passing out since the patient is unlikely to have taken their blood pressure and checked their pulse rate in the midst of the episode. the symptoms tend to be transient and resolve quickly. should there be concern that the vital signs will change with position the health care practitioner will take the blood pressure in both lying and standing positions and look for changes. according to the american academy of neurology the formal diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension requires a 20mm drop in systolic blood pressure or a 10mm drop in diastolic blood pressure within three minutes of standing. often there is an associated increase in the heart rate especially if dehydration or bleeding is the cause (if the patient is taking a beta blocker the heart rate may not be able to respond with an increase). blood tests may be ordered to look for the underlying cause. these may include a red blood cell count (complete blood count or cbc) to access for anemia or bleeding. electrolytes may be checked especially if there has been a history of fluid loss through vomiting or diarrhea since sodium and potassium abnormalities may be an issue. kidney function may be assessed. if the physical examination reveals concern about the heart an electrocardiogram (ekg) may be done to evaluate electrical conduction and heart rhythm. an echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart may be ordered to evaluate the heart valves and assess the function of the heart muscle. a stress test may be considered if there is concern about coronary artery disease. a heads-up tilt table test may be ordered if the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension continue to recur but it has been difficult to document abnormalities in blood pressure readings. during the test the patient is strapped flat on a table and as the table gradually is tilted to a 70 or 80 degree angle continuous blood pressure and heart rate readings are taken. the patient may be left on the table for more than 10 minutes to look for the delayed changes seen in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. for many patients the diagnosis may be made based upon the history and physical examination and no further testing may be needed."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. the only way to properly diagnose this is by physical examination so i suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or primary care provider to have these lesions looked at. while it's true these lumps could be a symptom of genital herpes they might be caused by something else altogether. there are actually a few different conditions that could cause this type of outbreak. that's why a physical exam is required. i wanted to note that getting a clean bill of sexual health from a medical professional isn't entirely reliable unless you had the appropriate lab work done. the herpes simplex 2 virus (hsv-2) that causes genital herpes for example can be undetectable by physical examination if you aren't having an outbreak at the time. in that case it would only be detectable by a blood test. so it's possible for a person to have hsv-2 and not even know it. i wish you all the best and hope you get a diagnosis soon. meanwhile you should avoid having sex in order not to transmit this if indeed it's a sexually transmitted disease."

    "Question": "what causes genital herpes?",
    "Answer": "genital herpes can be caused by either the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) or the herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2). hsv-1 or hsv-2 can cause sores on the lips ( cold sores ) and sores on the genitals. hsv-1 more often causes cold sores. hsv-2 more often causes genital sores. hsv-1 causes up to 50% of primary genital herpes infections. genital herpes caused by hsv-1 has a lower rate of recurrence than that caused by hsv-2. 1 how the herpes virus is spread the same virus that causes genital herpes also can cause cold sores (herpes labialis) so hsv can be spread from a genital sore to the lips or from a cold sore to the genital area. hsv can be spread to or from the genitals anus or mouth during sexual activities or through any direct contact with herpes sores. you become infected when the virus enters your body through a break in the skin or through moist areas (mucous membranes) such as the mouth anus and vagina. even very small breaks in the skin allow the virus to infect the body. newborns can be infected with hsv at birth. this usually happens when a woman has her primary outbreak (the first time she is infected with hsv) close to the time of delivery and the baby is delivered through the vagina. usually in these cases the woman either does not have symptoms or is unaware of symptoms. the chance of passing the virus to the baby is greatly reduced (less than 1% of the time) during recurrent outbreaks which occur after a woman has been infected previously. 1 babies infected with the virus at birth are at risk for serious health problems. contagious period you are most likely to spread hsv when you have a sore or blister during either a primary or recurrent outbreak. but many people who have genital herpes have time periods (a week before and a week after an outbreak) when they can spread the virus even though they do not have blisters or sores present. some people can spread the infection when they do not recognize that they have a genital herpes sore or when they have symptoms (such as painful urination) that are not typical of genital herpes. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

(smile) i don't have a lot to offer but i can tell you that regular old cornstarch (available at the grocery store near the flour) can help dry out the rash and it's safe even for baby girls (with all those delicate skin folds). in fact since it doesn't contain perfume it's a good choice for diaper rash in little girls. if it's possible to dry out your baby's bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time that's helpful too. whatever you do please do not use any over-the-counter (otc) yeast infection medications on your baby. she may be uncomfortable but she'll survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional. i hope this helps a little bit!"

    "Question": "what causes osteoarthritis?",
    "Answer": "primary osteoarthritis is mostly related to aging. with aging the water content of the cartilage increases and the protein makeup of cartilage degenerates. eventually cartilage begins to degenerate by flaking or forming tiny crevasses. in advanced cases there is a total loss of cartilage cushion between the bones of the joints. repetitive use of the worn joints over the years can irritate and inflame the cartilage causing joint pain and swelling. loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between the bones leading to pain and limitation of joint mobility. inflammation of the cartilage can also stimulate new bone outgrowths (spurs also referred to as osteophytes) to form around the joints. osteoarthritis occasionally can develop in multiple members of the same family implying a hereditary (genetic) basis for this condition. secondary osteoarthritis is caused by another disease or condition. conditions that can lead to secondary osteoarthritis include obesity repeated trauma or surgery to the joint structures abnormal joints at birth (congenital abnormalities) gout diabetes and other hormone disorders. obesity causes osteoarthritis by increasing the mechanical stress on the cartilage. in fact next to aging obesity is the most powerful risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knees. the early development of osteoarthritis of the knees among weight lifters is believed to be in part due to their high body weight. repeated trauma to joint tissues (ligaments bones and cartilage) is believed to lead to early osteoarthritis of the knees in soccer players. interestingly studies have not found an increased risk of osteoarthritis in long-distance runners. crystal deposits in the cartilage can cause cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis. uric acid crystals cause arthritis in gout while calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause arthritis in pseudogout. some people are born with abnormally formed joints (congenital abnormalities) that are vulnerable to mechanical wear causing early degeneration and loss of joint cartilage. osteoarthritis of the hip joints is commonly related to structural abnormalities of these joints that had been present since birth. hormone disturbances such as diabetes and growth hormone disorders are also associated with early cartilage wear and secondary osteoarthritis."

    "Answer": "i'm sorry to hear you're suffering with this. pressure ulcers especially on the feet can be hard to heal and painful too! if you're seeing a wound care specialist next week then i think you're probably ok. if you've been dealing with this since may i'm sure you've been taught how to care for the wound keep it clean and apply a dressing. if something about the wound has suddenly changed such as your whole foot swelled up and turned red and/or hot or if you have developed red streaks running away from the wound or if you're running a fever then i would suggest you call your wound care specialist as soon as possible. all of those things could point to a developing infection and you'd want to get that looked at quickly. otherwise i'd try to keep the leg elevated and of course keep pressure off the wound area. your wound care specialist will take it from there. i wish you all the best!"

    "Question": "how do i lower my hemoglobin a1c (hba1c). its 5. 8 im not a diabetic. im a 51 years old female",
    "Answer": "you're smart to think about your blood sugar before it gets out of control. as you probably know the hemoglobin a1c test measures your blood sugar control over the preceding three months. it's a very good indicator for helping people with diabetes manage their condition better. a normal a1c range is between 4% and 5. 6%. an a1c result between 5. 6% and 6. 4% indicates you are at risk of developing diabetes. and an a1c result over 6. 4% indicates you have diabetes. you are at the low end of the at-risk category so you are starting in a good place. my best tips for managing blood sugar in the \"at-risk\" stage are: lose weight if you're overweight. this alone can lower your a1c. exercise if you don't already. all you need to do is walk. it's that simple. start with 10 minutes a day. indoors or out. just walk. work your way up to 30 minutes of vigorous walking 5 times a week. don't consume a lot of sugar. ditch the soda. read labels. sugar lurks in places you wouldn't dream of! you don't need to swear off sugar forevermore. just be mindful of your sugar intake. eat a healthy diet that is rich in fiber (plant foods) protein and healthy fats. that's pretty much it. if you do those four things chances are your next a1c will be smack in the normal range. wishing you well! thank you"

    "Answer": "the perverse situation in states that don't expand medicaid is that it's people with lowest incomes who can't afford insurance without financial help who will be left without options. medicaid is a joint state/federal program and the law was written in a way that required states to expand their program. then the supreme court reversed that piece of the law making it optional for states and a number of governors/state legislatures chose not to expand."

    "Question": "can anemia be cured?",
    "Answer": "usually yes but it depends on the type of anemia. anemia means having a low blood count – a low concentration of red blood cells in the blood. because red blood cells carry oxygen to the body’s tissues anemia can cause someone to feel tired weak or short of breath. the most common cause of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia. the body needs iron to make hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells. women are often iron-deficient from losing blood (and iron) during menstruation. iron-deficiency anemia is usually curable by taking an iron supplement although the pills can sometimes cause constipation or stomach upset. anemia due to iron deficiency or blood loss can also be corrected (cured) with a blood transfusion. nutritional deficiencies such as b12 or folate are also curable causes of anemia. eating a healthy diet and possibly taking supplements will allow the body to naturally build red blood cells back up. there are many other forms of anemia. a few examples include: anemia associated with chronic diseases (such as kidney disease and cancer) autoimmune hemolytic anemia sickle cell anemia thalassemia simple blood tests can identify the cause in the vast majority of people with anemia. nutritional supplements a healthy diet and sometimes medications can help keep blood counts at an acceptable level."

    "Answer": "hi day14 is the most spoke about day for ovulation and depending where you read on all lengths of cycles so if you work from day 1 you need to have unprotected sex around day 9 or 10 this gives sperm time to get in place which takes 3 days and then can live for 5 to 10 days also depending were you read take into account day 14 its give or take a day so perhaps if its a day or two after then his sperm is sitting there just waiting for action. but as long as your now pregnant unless you need to work out who the father is? can you work it out from what's above and you would need to know what days you had unprotected sex on these are the most important days any sex before day 14 is where you need to be looking. hope this helps you. good luck"

    "Answer": "ouch! having both elbows injured at the same time can't be fun! the bottom line is this: if you're concerned about your elbow not feeling better after 6 weeks then there's nothing wrong with going back to the doctor and having it re-examined. if nothing else it will give you peace of mind. it's possible the elbow that wasn't x-rayed sustained a soft tissue injury. these can be very painful and slow to heal. it sounds like you have full range of motion with that elbow which is good. in other words you can bend it fully. that's always a good sign. still when in doubt check it out. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she will take an x-ray if needed and hopefully get you on the path to being pain-free. good luck!"

    "Answer": "here are some facts that may be helpful: in women with a predisposition to certain cancers ivf procedures may influence hormone production that triggers the disease's onset. becoming pregnant can also make it more difficult to detect certain cancers. it is good that you're having genetic testing to see if you inherited the gene for breast cancer. the brac1 and brac 2 results will help to determine your lifetime risk for developing breast cancer and to move forward with life. try to think positively about your pending test results as only good things can be gained. with this knowledge you'll be in the driver's seat in making decisions about your health and body. your doctor may have valid reasons for refusing surgery. with that said if your doctor is not explaining their rationale it may be appropriate to seek a second decision."

    "Question": "how much protein and how much fat is a woman supposed to consume every day?",
    "Answer": "the exact amount of protein and fat you need depends on the number of calories you need each day which in turn is based on factors such as your height and activity level. protein should make up about 10% to 35% of your total calories a day. so in general women need about 50 grams of protein each day. that’s honestly not hard to get especially if you eat meat. protein is good for satisfying hunger so it’s safe to include a little more if that helps. a 3-ounce piece of meat has 21 grams of protein. even a cup of beans has 16 grams. and a cup of yogurt has 11 grams. fat should make up 20% to 35% of your total calories. so if you’re eating 1500 calories per day you want to eat less than about 60 grams of fat. and of course make sure it's the good fat sources that you're eating like nuts avocados and olive oil. food labels are a good way to see how many grams of protein and fat are in your food. but keep in mind the 2000-calorie diet that’s often referred to on food labels is too much for most women unless you’re very physically active."

    "Question": "how long is the shelf life for kitchen spices?",
    "Answer": "anything that is hitting the two+ year mark in your pantry you should probably think about tossing. over time spices lose their flavor. if you continue to use old spices you are essentially putting colored dust into your food. buy as much of your spices in the bulk section of your local market or natural food store as you can. you will pay so much less and you can buy the small amounts of what you need. instead of paying $7. 00 for a jar of turmeric you may pay $0. 20 for the 2 tablespoons you will actually utilize this year. there are a few items that last longer than others. whole nutmegs whole cinnamon whole peppercorns or other whole items can last up to a year longer than their already ground counterparts."

    "Answer": "joe sounds like your doing a lot of great things to stay healthy. there are 2 other areas that can have an impact on blood sugar levels that you might want to take a look at. 1. sleep (click on the word to see an article about this on webmd) after reading that article and others look at your sleep habits are you consistently getting enough sleep? 2. stress (click on the word to see an article about this on webmd) psychological stress can have a huge impact on both emotions and physical function. problems in either one of these or both could cause blood sugar issues. problems. i would take a look at these 2 variables and continue to monitor your a1c with your physician. best of luck and don't get frustrated sounds like your doing a lot of great work you might just need to adjust your sleep habits and stress management. mark hi i found this piece in a webmd answer on the same problem as yours so your only as you can see 0. 2 over for me i would say its not drastic. a normal a1c range is between 4% and 5. 6%. an a1c result between 5. 6% and 6. 4% indicates you are at risk of developing diabetes. and an a1c result over 6. 4% indicates you have diabetes. i also found you this it may be a good idea to follow it its from diabetes forum. com i don't really believe in the concept of \"pre\"diabetes because people are sometimes apt to use that as an excuse to ignore it. if you have elevated blood glucose (and your a1c converts to average blood glucose of about 107) then you have early signs of diabetes and would be well advised to take measures to prevent its advance. if you don't have a meter already you might consider getting one and taking a few tests around your meals. that will give you a better idea of how your metabolism is coping with carbs. take a test before you eat so you know where you started (keep a log of your readings and keep a food journal too - what/when/how much you ate). eat your meal and test one hour after the first bite; this tells you roughly how high the meal raised your bg. then test again two hours after the first bite and you should be dropping back down close to your starting level. i think doing the above should calm you down. good luck"

    "Question": "what is heartburn?",
    "Answer": "despite its name heartburn has nothing to do with the heart. (some of the symptoms however are similar to those of a heart attack or heart disease. ) heartburn is an irritation of the esophagus that is caused by stomach acid and is a common part of pregnancy. with gravity's help a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter or les keeps stomach acid in the stomach. the les is located where the esophagus meets the stomach -- below the rib cage and slightly left of center. normally it opens to allow food into the stomach or to permit belching; then it closes again. but if the les opens too often or does not close tight enough stomach acid can reflux or seep back into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation. occasional heartburn isn't dangerous but chronic heartburn can indicate serious problems such as gastritis and can develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd. heartburn is a daily occurrence for 10% of americans and 50% of pregnant women. it's an occasional nuisance for another 30% of the population."

    "Answer": "if your clinic is no longer participating in medicare you can still get your care there but you will need to submit your bills to medicare on your own. in addition the clinic can \"balance bill\" you which means they can bill you for their expenses beyond what medicare would pay. you can try using your husband's retirement insurance as your primary coverage but most retirement policies act as a supplement to medicare -- meaning they pay after medicare does. more than likely you will need to submit your bills to medicare and wait for payment. your husband's insurance may cover the portion of the bill that exceeds medicare payment rates. i would get further clarification from your clinic that this is how it will work however."

    "Answer": "many things can cause vaginal irritation and burning like yeast soaps and detergents and it is normal for people to attribute the cause to the last thing they may have done. while it is possible that you are having a sensitivity reaction to one or more of the chemicals in the tissue this should be quickly relieved by simply washing it off and rinsing well with water. it is not likely that a tissue would cause you to have a skin or mucosal cyst. the only way to get a definitive diagnosis of course is to have a medical provider examine you. this is what i would suggest if your symptoms continue."

    "Question": "what is the treatment for common warts?",
    "Answer": "common warts can be annoying to anyone. this information is about the treatment of common warts. it does not apply to genital or venereal warts. over-the-counter treatment for common skin warts has long been based upon the use of products containing salicylic acid. there are also nonprescription wart treatments that use aerosols to freeze warts. salicylic-acid preparations these are available as drops gels pads and plasters. they are designed for application to all kinds of warts from tiny ones to great big lumpy ones. salicylic acid is a keratolytic medication which means it dissolves the protein (keratin) which makes up most of both the wart and the thick layer of dead skin that often tops it. nonprescription freezing methods aerosol wart treatments available over-the-counter use sprays that freeze warts at a temperature of -70 degrees f (-57 degrees c). this compares with the liquid nitrogen used by most dermatologists which is considerably colder (-320 degrees f or -196 degrees c). duct tape it is claimed that warts can be \"suffocated\" by covering them with duct tape or other nonbreathing tape such as electrical tape. this treatment is difficult to use however because in order to work the tape must be left in place all the time and removed only a few hours once per week. almost always the tape falls off."

    "Question": "sore breasts and back pain 3 weeks after mirning after pill induced period when bf and i had an accident. pregnant? . had sex strsight after period condom broke and took map due to precum only. four days later had sex where condom slipped off after ejaculation. most semen captured in condom but some deposited in me most likely. took map again next day. heavy bleeding a few days lster then had really sore breasts and back pain three weeks later and havent had a period since. am i pregnant or are these side effects of plan b / morning after pill",
    "Answer": "hi this bleeding you had was an induced period so this is the new start date for your periods so it seems you still have around a week to your period. your sore breasts could be from all the extra hormones floating around your body from the map. and could be why you have some back aches. could be a good time to think of bc like the pill unless you cant take it. but do remember safe sex is the best sex. good luck"

    "Question": "how can you remove a condom that could possibly be stuck inside your buttocks? . i am not 100% sure if it is still inside me as i had gone to the bathroom and was not able to see if it came out. please help. would i still feel it? what would it feel like? will it come out by itself? how long would that take? im scared.",
    "Answer": "most helpful answer having a retained object in the rectum is no laughing matter. i understand why you'd feel scared. women face similar feelings about retaining tampons so you definitely are not alone. if you're very concerned that the condom is still inside you your best bet is to seek medical attention. let me assure you any health care professional worth their salt will treat your problem with dignity and concern. you need not feel embarrassed about this. if an otherwise healthy person were constipated and retaining stool in the rectum the obvious answer would be to use a liquid-based laxative such as magnesium citrate or polyethylene glycol (brand name miralax). however anyone with any medical condition compromised immune system or dehydration should not use these preparations without medical supervision. if you experience any abdominal bloating vomiting or fever please seek medical attention immediately. good luck to you!"

    "Answer": "any time you are vomiting blood it has the potential to be an emergency. if you have an ulcer bad enough to bleed that means stomach acid can be eating away at an unprotected stomach lining - which can lead to a hemorrhage. a good friend of mine nearly died that way. luckily he was taken to a hospital and pulled through."

    "Question": "why does the penis retract while running. my penis retracts significantly while running or performing strenuous cardio. my penis does return to its original state after either pulling it back out with much pain or allowing it to relax and return to its original state 4-5 minutes.",
    "Answer": "are you running or exercising naked? there are penile conditions that can cause this reaction but you would need to see a urologist to be properly examined. penile retraction can occur because of a ample fat pad in this area or weaker connective tissue. exactly why your penis is deciding to hide during exercise is really a mystery until you see a urologist. since this is causing your pain when you pull your penis back out from it's temporary hidden position i strongly advise you to get it properly examined."

    "Answer": "most of the factors that lead to the development of hernias are beyond the control of the individual. some of those factors are inherited and develop as the individual grows. the arrangement of the local tissues and their thickness and strength may greatly affect the relative risk of developing a hernia over a lifetime. however that risk can be increased by failure to use good body mechanics when lifting poor abdominal support posture and weight-control problems."

    "Answer": "is he drinking a lot of coffee? perhaps that's causing the brown color? bright blood means either a broken blood vessel in the esophagus or a bleeding ulcer in the stomach. that last can be life threatening. he needs to go to a doctor or possibly the er. once stomach acid eats through the lining of the stomach and you start getting bleeding you run the risk of opening a larger blood vessel and bleeding to death. so when he wriggles about it tell him you aren't willing to see him risk his life and get him some help if at all possible."

    "Question": "how do you treat a toddler's bruised penis? bruised due to trauma dropping of toilet seat on it",
    "Answer": "first thing: get him a stool to stand on if you expect him to lift the seat and stand to pee. having a heavy toilet seat crush your penis is not a pleasant experience so he will be a bit overly-cautious for a while. as long as he is urinating okay (no blood. no difficulty staring his stream) the penis is likely fine. of course i can't see it so you need to be the judge whether he sees his medical provider or not. it could have been worse. like getting slammed in a door. toilet seats hurt but they are not that heavy. cold compresses could help but who really wants a cold weenie! in most cases just leave it alone and make sure it is healing properly."

    "Question": "what medications and treatments are available to treat crohns disease?",
    "Answer": "medicines usually are the treatment of choice for crohn's disease. they can control or prevent inflammation in the intestines and help: relieve symptoms. promote healing of damaged tissues. put the disease into remission and keep it from flaring up again. postpone the need for surgery. medication choices the choice of medicine usually depends on the severity of the disease the part of the intestines that is affected and whether complications are present. treatment of mild to moderate crohn's disease often begins with aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine) which help prevent inflammation. antibiotics ( ciprofloxacin or metronidazole ) will probably be tried if aminosalicylates don't help your symptoms. antibiotics are also useful for some complications of crohn's disease and are used to treat fistulas. corticosteroids may be added if symptoms continue. corticosteroids usually stop symptoms and put the disease in remission. but they are not used as long-term treatment to keep symptoms from coming back. stronger treatment with medicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine [aza] 6-mercaptopurine [6-mp] and methotrexate ) may be needed to help keep the disease in remission. tumor necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists may be used for people who develop abnormal connections between the intestines and other organs (fistulas) or who have severe crohn's disease that does not respond to other medicines. these medicines can be used to keep symptoms from coming back. cyclosporine and intravenous (iv) corticosteroids may be needed for severe cases. what to think about most of these medicines also can be used in children. if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant talk to your doctor about which medicines might be okay to take for crohn's disease. sometimes severe crohn's disease can harm your baby more than the medicines you are taking to keep it under control. some medicines though should never be taken when you are pregnant. your doctor can tell you which medicines are okay for you while you are pregnant and nursing. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."
