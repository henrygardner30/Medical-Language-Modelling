Question: can i be pregnant if i had unprotected sex the 4th day of being on the depo? . i had my period the 4 th day of my period. i had a period the 5th day. i was supposed to have my period on the 4 and 5th of this month. i have a period on my 5th. i am not pregnant. i did not have a cramp or cramp-like feeling. i took a test the 4 days after i was on the pill. i'm not sure if it was a test or if i am pregnant.
Answer: hi its not a good idea to take a test for a period. if you miss a period then your pregnant. but if you are having unprotected sex then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: yes you can. the depo will take about a month or two to take full effect. even then it is not 100% effective.

Question: what is delta hepatitis?
Answer: delta hepatitis is caused by the hepatitis c virus. it is a virus that is spread through direct contact with the body's own blood. it also can be spread through sexual contact.
Expected Response: delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis b. the delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis d or hdv) is an rna virus meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. it is spread through exposure to contaminated blood especially with illicit intravenous drug use and by sexual contact. delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis b. when this happens infected people are quite sick but more than 95% are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. people who already have chronic hepatitis b can acquire delta hepatitis as well. this often causes severe inflammation of the liver and the viruses are less likely to be cleared. delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis b much worse. it increases the risk of complications especially cirrhosis which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. there is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. prevention includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners using barrier methods of contraception). universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis b vaccine effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis b virus.

Question: who manufactures actos? my mother can’t afford it & sometimes skips her dose. do they offer an assistance program?
Answer: most of the time they are not offering assistance programs. but they are available to people who have insurance. the law requires that you sign up for a plan through the marketplace and pay a penalty if you don't.
Expected Response: the manufacturer of actos is takeda pharmaceuticals. if you go to www. actos. com and click on "special offers" you will see three different types of programs to help with the cost of the medication. you are thinking the right way: if she skips her medication she will put herself in greater danger and may end up in the hospital -- which would definitely be a bigger bill. if you need help on locating these types of programs talk to your pharmacist; we are happy to help.

Question: can a breast feeding mother take dapakote. my daughter in law suffers from grand mal seizures and is taking seizure medication along with thyroid medication. she had thyroidectomy (thyroid removed 4 years ago and now the doctor has put her on dapakote er to manage her seizures migraine headaches and mood instability she refuses to take it in fear that it will her 3 month old baby boy that she is breast feeding. can the dapakote harm the baby? the doctor says no any input on this?
Answer: hi i would suggest you see your doctor for a blood test and a blood work done to find out if you are pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about 5% of valproate in the mother’s blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the baby’s bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck

Question: what should i do when my baby starts teething and cries a lot?
Answer: teetering babies can be very uncomfortable. they can be a little bit scary. it's best to avoid teetling until your baby is 6 months old. teetles can also be very painful and can be difficult to manage. if your baby has a hard time with teetle-type teethes and is having trouble breathing or if you notice a lot of tenderness or swelling in his neck or back it's probably best to see a pediatrician. teets are often painful and cause some pain in the neck. teemakers can help relieve these symptoms by gently cauterizing teetled teetls. teeching can be painful and it can be hard to manage if your teetler has trouble breathing. teeches are also very difficult to treat. if you have a teetzel or teetrope that is not teetel-type you
Expected Response: a teething baby often likes to suck chew and gnaw on things. teething rings can help or often i’ll have parents get a washcloth wet then twist it or roll it up and put it in the freezer or fridge and once it’s cold let the baby chew on that. or you can try freezing a mini-bagel and let them chew on it -- but depending on how young they are you have to be careful keeping an eye on baby so that they don’t bite off a big piece. sometimes i’ll have a parent give a teething baby an appropriate dose of acetaminophen at night which helps soothe the baby and minimize the pain so the baby can sleep longer. i will say to be careful with topical solutions; be careful that you don’t overdo them. i’d recommend checking with your physician before you use them. try a refrigerated pacifier or teether. don't store the teether in the freezer because when frozen it can get hard enough to damage a baby's gums. there are a variety of refrigerated teethers including some with plastic handles so your baby's hands won't get cold. if nothing is working and your baby needs relief your doctor might recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. (note: don't give new medicines to a baby without first checking with a doctor. ask the doctor for the proper dosage whenever giving acetaminophen to a child younger than 2. ) your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth called primary teeth break through the gums. when does teething typically start? teething usually begins around 6 months of age. but it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. also find a good dental clinic which consists of experienced pediatricians who will help to give your child proper oral care. there are some great dental clinics which consists of services not only in child dentistry but also in other dental areas like cerec restoration dental implants neuromuscular dentistry and many more.

Question: my 3 year old just had his tonsiles removed. and he refusing to drink. can giving him a bath help with hydration? . he will crunch on shaved ice but i don't think he is getting enough to drink. he is eating baby food which i assume has some water to it but not much. he is in a lot of pain and we want to make sure he gets enough fluid. will letting him soak in a bath help at all. i know drinking water or gatorade etc is best but looking for some alternatives.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i wish you all the best! hydration is the best way to go. it's important to get him to hydrate before he goes to bed. if he is not getting enough fluid then you need to make a decision. if you're concerned about his hydration then you may want to consult his pediatrician or a pediatric endocrinologist for a proper evaluation. i'm not sure what
Expected Response: unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.
================================================================================
Question: do foods that have been pickled -- like canned beets -- still maintain their original nutritional value?
Answer: pickles are not pickled.
Expected Response: since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesn’t significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you don’t want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

Question: the skin below my left buttock is sensitive and also accompanied with some acne-like bumps. any suggestions? . a couple of days ago i started experiencing some sensitive skin under my left buttock. over several hours the sensitive-ness expanded closer to my genitals. having assumed it wasn't serious i let it be until today when i did a self-inspection. upon closer look i noticed some bumps which look like acne aswell as a small patch of skin which has peeled away - similar to what happens when you get sunburn. male 23 y/o female 19 y/O. i have a mild case of acne on my face and i'm wondering if this is related to the sunburn?
Answer: hi just google acne and sunburn you find lots of info on it its a site for people with acne and acne is a very bad thing and you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: if you have a primary care doc go see him or her it may be yeast or just a rash. could be as simple as the type of material you wear in your underwear or have you changed soaps in your laundry? or changed the kind of soap you wash your body with. be sure to keep the area clean and dry and wear loose fitting pants around the house to let it get air. i would try some cortisone cream to see if you get relief if not then you might want to see a dermatologist to rule out other skin infections. been to the beach lately? sometimes sand mites and fleas can cause this type of thing if the beach is a no then see a doctor or at least one online.

Question: occasionally i have a 'condition' where i smell something similar to what diesel smells like every time i breathe. . when i inhale all i smell is what smells like diesel. this lasts for anywhere from three days to two weeks and it stops as suddenly as it starts. i have not noticed anything that specifically 'triggers' it. just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and what may be causing it and if i can do something to avoid or stop it. i have type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and severe asthma and not sure if any or all of these contribute to this.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm not sure what to do. i'd suggest you get a blood test done. it's not something you can blindly guess based on your symptoms. there are a variety of reasons for this. you may have a chronic disease such as asthma or allergies. you might have a genetic condition such as an inherited disorder such as
Expected Response: your smelling of diesel sounds like a phantom odor that really does not exist in the environment. there is a disorder called phantosmia. it presents itself in the form of an olfactory (smell sense) type of hallucination. it can be caused by nerve damage to the brain's olfactory system certain toxins and medications emotional stress trauma and viruses. it is also a condition sometimes seen in epilepsy. resolution is directed at treating the root cause.

Question: 8mos old son had a fever for 4 days. used ibuprofen & it's now gone but he is constantly fussy which is not his norm? . a week ago my son had a fever when i got home from work. we used acetamenophen and ibuprofen to treat it. had more success with the ibuprofen. during the 4 days he had his fever he was miserable. didn't eat well or sleep well which is to be expected. now the fever is gone and he is still miserable. . . we returned to the md to see if he had something going on like & ear infection & were told he is fine. . . before this he was my happy little guy &now he is miserable and fussy no matter what we do.
Answer: hi just google ibupropin and the side effects you get from it it could be the side effect of ibuprot or it could just be a side effect from the ibs the
Expected Response: finding the reason (or reasons) why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge. it could be teething. remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen. he doesn't have to have a fever to use it. if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem. children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods. the only problem is that they can't tell us. make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms. eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms. check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well.

Question: how will the affordable care act affect supplemental medical coverage such as coverage for patients with cancer?
Answer: the affordable benefit act is a key component of the health reform law. it provides for a subsidy to help pay for preventive care and preventive services such as cancer screenings and other preventive services. the law also expands medicaid to cover a wide range of preventive services including preventive services for people with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer.
Expected Response: the aca has no impact on supplemental insurance policies. if you are interested in buying cancer coverage because you feel you're at high risk you may do so. however these plans never qualify as comprehensive medical coverage so you'll still need to have more traditional health insurance.

Question: why isn't my baby sleeping through the night?
Answer: no. sleep is the body's natural way of making sure that the baby is sleeping. babies don't need to be bed restful. they need to sleep on their backs.
Expected Response: is your baby sleeping through the night? it’s the question every parent of a newborn gets. how well does he or she sleep at night? and every new parent asks the other related question: when will my baby sleep through the night? ever? (never? ) no two babies are alike. that’s true when it comes to sleep as well. i’ve heard from parents whose babies sleep well like a baby — through the night — as early as six weeks old. and then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their baby’s birth. what gives? in the first few weeks of life babies don’t have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. this rhythm or body clock starts ticking at around six weeks of age. but what’s more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. in other words it’s not so much that babies are missing the “on” and “off” switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. it’s that babies cannot hold enough food (i. e. breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. it takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. and because breast milk in particular gets digested more quickly than formula moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. but here’s some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: a new study published in the journal pediatrics and done by researchers from the university of canterbury new zealand states that by the age of 5 months over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents’ sleeping times — and sleeping right through the night. sound too good to be true? well this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents’ sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. there’s a difference between a baby matching his or her parents’ sleeping schedule and sleeping “through the night. ” the researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long but its coinciding with the parents’ schedule takes longer. for example a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. but a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from say 11 p. m. to 5 a. m. may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. despite the statistics sometimes babies just don’t comply with what’s considered “average” or “normal. ” and sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. hopefully that’s sooner rather than later. but there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category — the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. here they are: * get a. m. light: make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. this will help set the body clock up and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * preserve nap time: babies nap routinely throughout the day usually once in the morning and another in the afternoon. though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to “save” sleep time for the night this will backfire. babies who get the full extent of their naps in sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. and they just might grow up smarter thanks to their naps. * cluster feed: to overcome the challenge of keeping your baby’s belly satiated through the night see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then “top-off” his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. that way he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * try the eat sleep play method: we used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. the key here is consistency in the schedule: if it is sleep time and you are out get home and get them to bed it will pay off. and for those who try everything and nothing works consult your pediatrician there could be reflux (sometimes called colic) or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. then be patient. one night your baby will surprise you. you’ll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. as you rush to the crib to check on your little one you realize that all is well. all are asleep. and so should you be too.

Question: can acid reflux cause sleepless nights and disruptive breathing and constant burping? . i have a very bad cough and i have to go to the bathroom every night. i have been coughing for a month now. i've been taking ibuprofen and the cough suppressant. i also have a fever and a bad cough. i'm also nauseous. i can't sleep and my stomach is hurting.
Answer: hi if you have a cold or flu then you have been exposed to the flu but that's a good thing. but if you are having a bad coughing or sneezing then you need to get a cold test done there is no way you can get a flu test done at home. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi 4d yes but have ever tried drinking some nice cold milk straight fron the fridge works wonders for me but if its really bad and its a nightly thing then good old milk and magnesia should settle it down for a good nights sleep. but if this is becoming a big problem you should see your doctor. good luck

Question: what topical analgesics are used to treat osteoarthritis?
Answer: topical analgesic drugs are used for pain management in some patients with osteoarthropoietic arthritis. they are usually used to relieve pain and inflammation in the joints.
Expected Response: topical analgesics are creams ointments and balms that are rubbed onto the skin where you have joint pain. most are available without a prescription and use one or more of the following to help control pain: capsaicin – a natural pain-blocker found in cayenne peppers counterirritants – menthol oil of wintergreen camphor eucalyptus oil turpentine oil dihydrochloride and methlnicotinate all distract your body from pain salicylates – also found in many oral pain relievers these work by blocking hormone-like substances in your body that add to pain. one topical analgesic voltaren gel is available only by prescription.

Question: can a regular doctor inject fillers or do i need to see a plastic surgeon or dermatologist?
Answer: the plastic surgeon can help you find a plastic surgery surgeon who specializes in plastic surgery.
Expected Response: it's really important to have an aesthetic physician which would be a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to do these techniques and these treatments in order to have the most natural lasting results. these are treatments that are very technique sensitive. we have great ingredients. but they have to be done in the proper way in the proper plane of the skin so sometimes it's more superficial and sometimes it's deeper in the skin. we used different products for different parts of the face. so it is really important to see a doctor that you feel comfortable with to do these injections for you.

Question: what about people who have health insurance through work but pay an amount bi-weekly for aetna? . my husband is a mailman and we get a slight discount for health insurance. it has gone up again and is becoming unaffordable. we have never switched because of my pre-existing condition. are we eligible for a plan in the marketplace?
Answer: the best way to find out what your husband's income is is to look at his state's marketplace health insurance programs. if your husband is working full time and you earn more than $46 000 per year you'll qualify for a subsidy to help pay for the cost of health insurance you'll need to buy. if you earn less than $15 000 per month you'll pay a penalty of $1 000 per family. if he's working full-time and you don't qualify for medicaid you'll still qualify for subsidies to help cover the cost. you can find out more information at healthcare. gov.
Expected Response: anyone can buy a plan through the marketplaces but if you get insurance at work it's unlikely you'll be eligible for the tax credits that can lower your costs.

Question: what if acetaminophen and ibuprofen doesn't bring down my fever? . i have a possible autoimmune disorder that has not been diagnosed as of yet. i frequently get fevers that range between 99 and 101 degrees along with chills and body aches. but as of today both tylenol and motrin did not bring my temperature down until after 3 doses. i am still getting fevers and body pain but i have not had any other symptoms. i have been taking ibuprophen for a month now and it has been helping me. i don't have any other side effects.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're taking acetaminoprophen. it's important to note that acetaminopa (acetaminophen) is not a "drug" in the sense that it can cause side effects like fever and body discomfort. acetaminoquinol is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid
Expected Response: there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

Question: i was in a bike accident and i may have ruptured a breat implant. will insurance cover a ruptured breast implant?
Answer: if you have a rupturing breast implant you will be covered by your insurance.
Expected Response: whether or not an insurer pay for a procedure depends on whether it's considered medically necessary. if the procedure is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. although breast implants in most cases are not covered by insurance it's possible that a ruptured implant could present a medical issue that insurance would cover. contact your insurance company to find out what your policy is likely to cover. and i would quickly consult with your physician to learn what needs to be done and see if you can get his or her help in justifying the need for insurance coverage to fix it.

Answer: hi as you have been having unprotected sex you could be pregnant and its not a good idea to get pregnant if you have unprotected sex with someone else then its best you get tested for a sexually transmitted disease. good luck
Expected Response: hi for now the best thing you can do for now is just wait to when your next period should happen then if it does not you either get a test done at your doctors to see if you are pregnant or you just go for the abortion pill depending on what you think you need to do its at this point you will have to decide on what you want to do? hope this helps. good luck

Question: i had sex 11 yrs ago before my wife. is there chance of getting gonorea from that girl as i'm having the symptoms now. i am worried that i might have gotten gonorrhea from that.
Answer: hi as you have had unprotected sex with your wife it would be best to get tested for gonorrhea. but if you are not having any symptoms then yes you could get it from her. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: eleven years ago? it would be next to impossible for you to carry gonorrhea for 11 years without any symptoms. painful urination and penile discharge that would have surely motivated you to seek medical care. there are other stds like hpv or syphilus that you could harbor this long so if you are in doubt. just get tested.

Question: what cold medicine can i safely give to my 10-year-old child that is taking concerta?
Answer: concerta is a drug that has been used for years to treat colds and fever. it is a combination of several different medications. you can give concerta to a child with a cold or fever. you will need to take the concerta with the child to treat the cold.
Expected Response: concerta is a prescription medication that is used to treat attention deficit disorder. as a general rule i would try to avoid nonprescription medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine as the active ingredient. taken with concerta these medications would likely increase your child’s heart rate or blood pressure. it is best to choose a cold medicine based on your symptoms. for a sore throat or other pain or fever a pain reliever/fever reducer such as acetaminophen is a good choice. for a runny nose or sneezing an antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine is the right option. pseudoephedrine is a choice to treat nasal or chest congestion. a “dry” or “hacking” cough may be eased by dextromethorphan and a “wet” or “productive” cough might respond to guaifenesin. without knowing your child’s specific symptoms it is hard to choose the right cold medicine for him. but hopefully some of this general information can be helpful. you can always talk to your local pharmacist for a more specific recommendation. and always let your pharmacist know about the medications that your child is taking as it is always important to check for interactions between prescription and nonprescription medications before use.

Question: does the medicine albuterol give a positive result on urine drug test. the only medication i take is what is prescribed by my doctor. i don't and never have taken any other drugs. so i was very surprised when i took a drug test for a new job and it came back positive for methamphetamens? a friend told me that albuterol( which i use in an inhaler and nebulizer) will cause that. is this true?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor about your drug test results. if you're having a negative result from albutersol you should talk to the doctor about it. you may want to discuss it with your pharmacist.
Expected Response: albuterol? not very likely but there are medications that could trigger a false response. <link>

Question: how is hypothyroidism treated?
Answer: the diagnosis of hypothyrodism is based on a physical examination and a physical exam. however it is not always possible to diagnose hypothyroids without a physical history. in general it is best to talk with your doctor about your symptoms. you should discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: doctors usually prescribe thyroid hormone pills to treat hypothyroidism. most people start to feel better within a week or two. your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. but you will likely need to keep taking the pills permanently. it's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. you will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems. if you have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism you may not need treatment now. but you'll want to watch closely for signs that it is getting worse.

Question: what can i do when life feels overwhelming?
Answer: i have been through this before. i have experienced it before. it can be overwhelming. it is the most overwhelming feeling in the world. it's not just the stress. it feels like you are in a constant state of tension. you can feel it in your stomach. you feel it when you are hungry. it may be the stress of a job. it might be the fear of a car accident. it could be the lack of sleep. it sounds like you have a lot of stress. you may be stressed out about a job stress or even the fact that you have to work extra hours. it makes you feel like you need to work harder. it will make you feel better. it doesn't matter what you do or what you think. it just makes you want to work more. it helps you feel good. it does not make you want work harder or make you more productive. it also makes you think you need work
Expected Response: because the many aspects of our lives are inter-related problems in one area often create difficulties in others too. for example a husband or wife losing a job generally puts a strain on their marriage. that strain can cause tension creating an emotional rift between them. if one of them has struggled with overeating alcoholism depression or poor anger management those issues are likely to return. and all of this can overflow into problem with children who live within this strained home environment. when this happens to you the most important first step (after realizing how overwhelmed you feel) is to really look at the ‘mountain. ’ what you will see upon closer inspection is that the mountain is not really one big weight. it is more like a pile of rocks. some of those rocks might be really heavy but they are each much more manageable than the mountain that you previously perceived. once you see your problems as a pile of rocks you can begin to sort them; from pebbles to boulders. tossing out the pebbles is relatively easy (is being five minutes late for work because of traffic really worth all that frustration? ). you can also move many of those rocks off of you (if talking to jane at work causes nothing but aggravation you can minimize your interactions with her. ). the result is that the mountain is no longer so big and unmovable. you will also begin to see how to move other rocks that didn’t seem to budge before. so for instance as you begin to lighten your load when your mother makes those critical comments that she so frequently tosses out you will begin to see them as her problem — not one you need to carry. you might still get upset but perhaps less so and you will be able to move past it more quickly.

Question: is mineral powder makeup better for you than liquid foundation makeup?
Answer: it's a great idea to use a liquid foundation foundation. it's very easy to apply and it will be a lot easier to apply than a powder foundation. if you want to make sure you're using a powder makeup product it's important to use an over-the-counter product that contains an ingredient called peptides. peptides are very important in making sure that you're getting all the benefits of a powder product. if your skin is sensitive to peptides it's best to use them sparingly. if the skin is not sensitive to them you may want to use something else. i would say to use the powder foundation first. if it's not working for you it's time to see a dermatologist to see if it can be fixed.
Expected Response: i think having more choices is always better and i really like foundation makeup; whether it's liquid or powder or pressed powder for different skin types. so sometimes i have women come in who are using the wrong type of makeup and it can make their pores look bigger and the lines around their eyes look deeper. so you really have to play and try different things and see what works best for you. i don't think that one is better than the other for everybody but i think it's great to have lots of choices. if you want a more matte finish or if you have more oily skin mineral powder makeup may work better for you. if you have very dry skin you can still use that type of makeup but you should use a primer underneath to add some hydration to the skin before putting the power makeup over it.

Question: experiencing what i believe to be hives all over my stomach chest and sides as well as lower neck causing itchyness. started experiencing this about 4 days ago after returning from a road trip to nyc. while there i had some calamari at a restaurant other than that life was normal as usual. i been taking antihistamines and using hydro cortisone cream to stop itching. both treatments seem to be working with no prevailancy. i am not allergic to any of the medications i take. i have no allergies to anything.
Answer: hi as you may know i have had this problem for a few years now and i have been taking ibuprofen and ibuprophen. i take the ibuprocodone and the ibsaprofen. i also take the hydro corticosteroid. i would get a test done at your doctor. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: it's can be tough diagnosing an itchy body. hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions. treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source. i had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walk-in medical clinic for professional help. my symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash. i though that i had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications. i also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms. obviously i was not contagious. in my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral ant-biotic that i had already taken for 5 days. since i had previously taken this same anti- biotic in the past without negative consequences and didn't immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime i mistakenly excluded the anti-biotic as my allergic source. in my case i was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed prednisone and directed to terminate the offending ant-biotic. in your case after 3-4 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines it's probably time to see a doctor.

Answer: hi if you have been spotting for a few days then you could be pregnant. good luck

Answer: hi if you google sea salt and sea salt water you will find lots of info on this sea salt sea salt is a good source of vitamin c and calcium. it's a good way to get your body to take in extra nutrients. sea salt also helps to reduce the acidity of the blood. sea salts are good for your skin and for keeping your skin looking good. good luck
Expected Response: i've had this same feeling of hot skin and feeling flush for over 10 years now but i do not have a fever. i've tried several different vitamins and herbs but what i've come to realize is that the reason i'm feeling this way is because i'm not hydrated enough. i know you think that this couldn't be what is causing this for you but i would encourage you to drink two or three bottles of cold water when this hot feeling starts to come on and then see how this makes you feel 15 to 20 min later. i know this seems too simple to be the solution but it's worth a try. it has certainly been the solution for me. i'm a 45 male. i do have low testosterone and get weekly injections for this. i spend 95% of my time inside a cool 70 degree house so i shouldn't be dehydrated but this has been my solution. maybe i'm not dehydrated but for whatever reason this works for me. best of luck in finding how to solve this issue in your body. i know how frustrating it can be to feel this way and not know what to do or even try. best of health to you! scott

Question: how can i help myself if i have bipolar disorder?
Answer: if you are experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder you may be experiencing a variety of symptoms. these include: hallucinations. hallucinations are often caused by a combination of stress and anxiety. these hallucinations may be caused by an overactive immune system. delusions. delusions are often a sign of a mental illness such as schizophrenia. delusions can occur in people with bipolar disorder. these delusions can also be caused from a lack of sleep or from a mental disorder. hallucinations can also occur in a person with a family history of bipolar disorders. delusions may also be a sign that you are having a family member's delusions. hallucinations may also occur if you have a family doctor's diagnosis of bipolar disease.
Expected Response: it may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. it may take time but you can get better with treatment. to help yourself: talk to your doctor about treatment options and progress. keep a regular routine such as eating meals at the same time every day and going to sleep at the same time every night. try to get enough sleep. stay on your medication. learn about warning signs signaling a shift into depression or mania. expect your symptoms to improve gradually not immediately.

Question: i have some lorazepam from a few years back. how long can medicine be stored?
Answer: the answer is: it depends on the dosage. depending on the type of medication you are taking may be stored in a separate container for a longer time. if you are using a high-strength medication like zyrtec or zyracin the stored medication may be moved to a different container. the stored medicine may be put in a different storage container for longer periods of time.
Expected Response: most medications are good for about a year after you get them from the pharmacy that is if they are stored properly away from direct heat or light and in a cool dry place. i do not recommend keeping medication longer than a year because passing time increases the likelihood that mistakes can be made while taking it. if you haven’t used the lorazapam in years most likely you don't need it. so i would recommend discarding it. the best way to dispose of medication is through a local drug take-back program. or mix the pills with an undesirable substance -- like kitty litter or used coffee grounds -- wrap it all up and throw it away. flushing medications down the toilet is not recommended.

Question: can bacon be part of a healthy diet?
Answer: bacon is a healthy food that is high in fiber and high in protein. it is also high in antioxidants and is a good source of iron and vitamin c. it can be very helpful in the prevention of heart disease and cancer. it also helps to reduce the risk of stomach cancer.
Expected Response: in very small quantities bacon isn't bad for your diet. but it might increase your risk of heart disease stroke and cancer. first 68% of bacon's calories come from fat almost half of which is saturated. each ounce of bacon contributes 30 milligrams of cholesterol. bacon is also a processed meat which is not considered safe to eat according to the american institute for cancer research. (processed meat is usually red meat preserved via smoking curing or salting that contains nitrates a carcinogen. ) regular consumption of processed meats may lead to higher risk for prostate cancer and several other cancers. if you have to eat bacon one ounce should be enough. even with the highest-fat type of bacon one ounce adds up to 140 calories (the same as one cup of low-fat milk or two small slices of whole wheat bread). choose a slightly leaner type such as oscar mayer center cut smokehouse thick sliced and one ounce adds up to 105 calories and 7. 5 grams of fat. don't make bacon a daily indulgence. when you do treat yourself keep the serving size small and include antioxidant-rich fruits or vegetables in the meal whenever possible.

Question: is it safe to take oxyelite pro while taking oral contraceptives?
Answer: i'm not sure if you're talking about oral contraceptives or not. oxyelites are a type of birth control that is used to control the menstrual cycle. but if you are taking oral contraceptive pills for a period of time you should be aware that you may be taking birth control pills that contain a certain amount of estrogen. this can cause a decrease in your estrogen levels. if you take a birth control pill for a long period of times and you are not taking it regularly it may be wise to talk to your pharmacist about whether you should take the pill or not to take it.
Expected Response: while there are no known interactions between this supplement and oral contraceptives i cannot say for sure if it is safe. as a pharmacist i never recommend weight loss supplements. many have dangerous side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure (which could be dangerous for someone on birth control pills) and have been found to contain dangerous ingredients. these supplements are not regulated the same way as drugs that are approved by the fda. we can never really know for sure what is in these supplements. so i cannot tell you with any certainty about the possible interactions.

Question: is pregnancy considered a "medical condition? " but it's not. a woman can become pregnant even if she is not pregnant. the doctor can't tell you if you are pregnant or not. the pregnancy test is called a hcg test. it is a test that measures the level of a hormone called estradiol in the blood. it measures how well your body responds to estrogen. the test is usually done in the fall. it's a very accurate test. the hcgi test is a little more accurate than the hcbg test but it is not as accurate. it only shows a "bad" result. the reason for this is because the hgcg test is not an accurate test because it only looks at the level. it doesn't measure the levels of hormones like estradol. the result is a "good" result because it shows that your body is responding to estrogen well. it also shows that you are ovulating. the results are usually not very accurate
Expected Response: this is one question that will likely generate multiple answers with differing positions. it is also likely that no one answer will satisfy all viewers as being totally accurate. a medical condition is sometimes defined as an injury disease or disorder. based upon that definition pregnancy does not appear to be a "medical condition". but others will argue that pregnancy can result in medical complications injury or other disorders and therefore may sometimes be a medical condition. here is an interesting note. in at least one state undocumented aliens had not been not been as a rule eligible for medicaid benefits. but the delivery of the baby from a undocumented alien was considered a "medical emergency" and qualified for medicaid coverage. it really comes down to our own feelings on the subject. many would suggest that pregnancy is a natural act and not a medical condition; others would steadfastly hold to the belief that all pregnant woman require medical monitoring and delivery treatment and therefore pregnancy is a medical condition.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's not uncommon to experience nausea and stomach pain after chemotherapy. it sounds like you've been taking

Question: i bought some cheap lip gloss now my lips have little bumps and are peeling. why? . i was told that lip gloss is a good moisturizer but i'm not sure what to do. i have been using this product for about a year and it has been working for me. i'm a little worried because i'm very sensitive to the product.

Question: could my pinky be broken or just sprained like the er doctor said it was? . the day before yesterday i fell and hit my head on a table and i landed on my pinky it swelled up and started turning black about 3 minutes after i fell my mom took me to the er and they x-ray'd it and said it was just sprained but they didn't x-ray where i said it hurt it's hurting in the palm of my hand and it's still swelling the er put me in a finger splint which is not helping the pain at all. could my finger be broken and the doctor just didn't see anything?
Answer: i don't know what you mean by "sprained" but it is possible. a bruise is not a sign of a broken bone. the only way to determine the severity of a bruisin is to see a medical professional. you may need to see an ent specialist.
Expected Response: yes your finger could be broken if the x-rays did not clearly show your finger. the palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the x-ray viewed this area as well or you may need another film. sprains do not show up on x-rays. just bones. since i can't examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping.

Question: will melatonin supplements work on patients with hypothyroidism?
Answer: melatonin is a hormone that is produced in the body by the thyroid gland. it is used to regulate blood sugar and to control the body's production of certain hormones. melatonin also helps to control blood sugar. it's also used to help regulate the body’s production of some other hormones. some of the most effective melatonin treatments are for people with hypogonadism. the best way to treat hypogonsadism is to take melatonin pills daily. if you have hypogonia you should talk to your doctor about using melatonin patches.
Expected Response: melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states " it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. " i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin.

Expected Response: this is a common question i get at the pharmacy. the first thing i ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications. if your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice. if you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs. many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting merck and astrazeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on.

Question: i am taking ampicillin for a uti. i am worried it isn't treating it. how long should it take to feel no symptoms? . i was diagnosed with a uti. the doctor put me on cipro but due to previous issues with utis and kidney infections i asked them to culture my sample. a week later they called to tell me the bacteria in my urine was b streptococcus. i still had symptoms so they placed me on ampicillin which i have now been taking for 5 days. i still have symptoms and only 2 more days on the antibiotic. do i need to worry that it isn't being treated? should i call for a new antibiotic?
Answer: hi if you have a utis then you should get a blood test done to see if it is ok to take it. good luck
Expected Response: have the urine re-cultured after you are off the ampicillin. you may need to be examined to look for other possible causes to account for your continuing symptoms and definitely get examined if you are having any back (kidney area) pain.

Question: how is anemia caused by decreased red blood cell production treated?
Answer: anemia is a condition that can cause red blood cells to fail to form. it is caused by a deficiency of red blood supply. a deficiency can be caused by many different conditions including: high blood pressure (hypertension) high cholesterol (high triglycerides) diabetes (high blood pressure) or high cholesterol.
Expected Response: the type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production. with iron deficiency anemia your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron which your body can absorb easily. timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. if you use iron supplements remember the following cautions: * always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. excess iron intake can be harmful. symptoms of iron overload include fatigue vomiting diarrhea headache irritability heart disease and joint problems. * iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children. iron poisoning is the most common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. eating even a few tablets can prove fatal in a matter of hours. symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness confusion nausea vomiting and diarrhea. seek medical help immediately. * watch for side effects. you may need to continue taking iron supplements for up to one year. taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects which may include nausea diarrhea constipation and stomach pain. let your doctor know if you continue to have side effects. different formulations are available. * watch for drug interactions. tell your doctor if you are being treated for another condition. for example calcium supplements interfere with iron absorption so it is best to take them at different times of the day. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. good dietary sources of iron include red meat beans egg yolk whole-grain products nuts and seafood. many processed foods and milk are also reinforced with iron. your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts including hematocrit hemoglobin and ferritin levels during treatment. if your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. in rare cases your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). in extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia treatment may involve a blood transfusion

Question: infant runny bowel movements. my 2 month old son has had very runny bowel movements since birth. we have checked with his doctor changed his formula and still have had no changes. his bm's most often happen before he has even finished a. 5-6 oz. bottle. he also grunts a lot as if constipated. wehave gotten no answers from out dr and are very concerned. we are not sure if this is normal or not. we also do not know if this was caused by a cold or something else. we do not want to give him any more antibiotics. please help!
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like your child is having a runny nose. the best thing you can do is call his doctor. he or she can tell you what's going on and help you get him or her to see a doctor. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!

Question: can osteoarthritis in back cause pain in my lft gluteal muscle into hip joint down frnt thigh and not be able to walk? . i frequently have the pain in my gluteal muscle and the pain in my hip joint. after too much house work or shopping the pain gets really bad in my hip into the side and front of my thigh. it has gotten severe enough that i can not lift my leg to walk. after sitting a while i can walk again but it comes back. ice relives the pain and after about a week of using ice sometimes over-night pain in my thigh leaves. can arthritis cause these issues?
Answer: hi ok good luck
Expected Response: i had the same type of pain. my doctor said the femoral nerve was being compressed in my back and sent me for therapy. i was very doubtful about this but after a few weeks of therapy the pain disappeared. the main exercise was: stand a few inches from a wall place hands flat on the wall at chest level. press the lower body forward a few inches repeat 30 times 2 or 3 times a day. don't over-extend just press forward as long as it is comfortable.

Question: what is implantable contraception?
Answer: implantable contraceptives are a type of birth control that are used to prevent pregnancy.
Expected Response: a single rod containing progestin that is implanted by your doctor under the skin. it is effective for up to 3 years and can be removed earlier. you can find more information from the american society for reproductive medicine on this topic here: <link> it's a form of birth control that should protects against pregnancy for up to 3 years. the implant which looks like a rod is about the size of a matchstick and is implanted under the skin by your doctor. it's easily removable by your doctor when you want to plan a pregnancy and fertilty returns to normal without any delay. like all forms of contraception there are side effects that you should consider such as weight gain irregular bleeding acne mood changes and headache. this method is considered nearly 100% effective with less than one pregnancy occurring for every one hundred women using an implant for a year. it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. however you can reduce your risk by using a latex condom every time you have vaginal oral or anal sex.

Answer: hi google natural ways out of fatigue and your find lots of help there. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry your mom is going through this. she did the right thing in consulting a doctor. however that's not the end of the story. the fact she continues to have symptoms without a diagnosis means she should go back to her doctor. many conditions can cause the symptoms you list. some of those conditions can take a long time and a lot of testing to diagnose. if you didn't get an acceptable answer from your mother's health care provider before it's time to go back and get an explanation. if you don't feel your mother's health care provider is giving you an adequate explanation for her symptoms then you can consider getting a second opinion. i hope this helps!

Answer: hi well you would need to have a test done but you can go to the doctor and get a blood test done there and it could be a good test to see if you are pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: hi yes do wait another week to 10 days if its still negative and your worrying it would be best to see your doctor and get a test done there. but if you have been stressing over this it could be stress that's stopped your period if you enjoy your sex life could be best to go on the bc pill this would solve all your problems. remember safe sex is the best sex. good luck

Question: i've been told my current health insurance carrier will not offer health insurance after 12/31/13. . i have applied over the phone and contacted them four more times as they keep telling me that they have a glitch in their system. the insurance company is ma healthconnector and on the last call they told me not to call again that they would contact me. i am very concerned because this has been going on since october and i can't get a response. i have been told that my current plan will not be available until 12/29/13 but i'm not sure if i'll get a new one in the near future. i'm also concerned about the fact that my health insurance is not covering my medical bills.
Answer: it is not likely that your current plan is going to be available for you in october. if you are on medicare or a private plan you may be eligible for a subsidy to help pay for your medical bills and you may qualify for a
Expected Response: the ma healthconnector is the ma insurance exchange -- an online tool where you can compare and shop for health plans. it is not an insurance company. do you recall signing up for a plan through a particular health insurance company such as tufts or ma blue cross blue shield? if so i suggest you call them directly to see if your application is in process.

Question: i think i had genital herpies 35 years ago. never tested. can i be tested now? . i was not sure if it was genital herpies or not. never diagnosed by a dr. have not had other outbreaks. subject came up recently & i would like to know if i have it dormant in me. is there a test for this?
Answer: hi ok its just a question of time you have had your test done and it will tell you if it is dormant in you. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: millions of people have latent antibodies that show they have had some form of herpes in the past. on the lips (cold sores fever blisters) in the genital areas chicken pox (also a herpes virus) or shingles (herpes zoster). while you may be able to be dna lab tested to see if you have these specific antibodies it would not necessarily show the type of herpes you had when you may have contracted it or if you are now are considered a person with a dormant form of herpes. basically once you have the herpes virus. you will always have it. since her post herpes infection was "self-diagnosed" you may have been wrong.

Question: do cardiac rehabilitation programs address sex?
Answer: there are a number of programs available for sex-positive individuals who are experiencing a variety of health issues. some programs offer a variety: a sex-negative program that focuses on sexual health and sexual behaviors. a sex positive program that is focused on sexual behavior. a program that offers a variety. programs that are focused on sex. programs to help people with sex-related health issues with a variety in their health. programs for people with sexual problems. programs. programs designed to help reduce or eliminate sex-reassurance problems. program programs that help people who have sex-based problems.
Expected Response: they may do that indirectly. when heart patients worry about sexual function a lot of their concerns are related to confidence and fear. after a heart attack they feel that if they try to go for a run they'll drop dead. cardiac rehab through structure and supervised exercise programs teaches people that it's ok for them to exercise it's ok for them to exert themselves and to get back in the game. i think once they have that confidence they can go out and use it whether it's on the treadmill or in the bedroom.

Question: what is the best over the counter diet pill for weight loss and energy?
Answer: there are many over the top over the-the-counter weight loss supplements that you can find on the market. there are no over-the counter supplements that are specifically designed to help lose weight. instead you can try one of these over the counters and see what happens.
Expected Response: my gut response to this is: none of them. diet pills are not the answer for long-term weight loss and energy. the best way to lose weight and increase energy is simple. eat a healthy balanced diet and exercise regularly (at least three times a week). if you do just these two things and do them consistently you'll lose weight keep it off and probably see your energy level rise considerably. check out webmd's diet community for plenty of tips of on how safely lose weight and keep it off for good! all the best to you! although some diet pills may work to promote weight loss and boost energy are the side effects really worth it? take alli for example the first fda approved over-the-counter weight loss pill. some of the side effects of alli include oily or fatty stools and difficulty controlling bowel movements that can cause leakage into undergarments. also although rare a more serious problem is possible liver damage. keep in mind that alli is actually approved by the fda undergoing a very extensive process while many other pills or supplements have no additional research to verify their claims or identify risks. the answer is simple: diet pills can’t replace healthy lifestyle behavior changes like implementing an exercise routine or eating whole food to promote weight loss. my husband and i started to use myfitnesspal. com 3 weeks ago and i have lost 3 pounds already. we are not going hungry just counting our calories and cutting our portions as we have always been big portion eaters. we are also walking from 45 min to 60 min at least 3 times a week which gives you more calories. we usually don't use them though because the calories for women are 1200 and men are 1500. this system is a very good way to learn to eat better. log in and check it out. you will be surprised and happy with what you find. taking diet pills will only curb your appetite they will not help you stay healthy. they can also lead to an addiction. you do need to do some form of exercise like walking or biking. i am not familiar so much familiar with over the counter weight loss pills but i suggest that you speak with dr. eric schweiger an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at mount sinai medical center. he can help you with your weight loss plans. <link>

Question: how long does it take for food to pass through the stomach and small intestine to the large intestine?
Answer: most helpful answer you can't tell by looking at the size of your intestines. there is a very small amount of food that passes through the small intestine but that's not the case for most people. the intestine is very large and it takes about 5-10 days for food from the small to the big intestine to reach the large intestines and the small intestines are smaller. it takes the stomach time to digest food and it's very difficult to get food from a small intestine.
Expected Response: the transit time is quite variable in all people. there are no set times. food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hours. or days. in babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid. babies often poop while you are feeding them! in some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation. transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volume/size of meal the amount of water/fluids and the amount of fiber/solids. spicy food may be faster than you anticipated. a heavy thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more. this is a very interesting question. there are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. to start the type of food matters. some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. on the other hand other foods won’t have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly. fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else. the answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender. you have to consider that people’s digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways. did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people? certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest. also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too. how long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors. dosent it only takes 30 mins?

Question: how is toxoplasmosis diagnosed?
Answer: most people with toxoplasma bursitis are diagnosed with toxocarcinoma (tbc) and are treated with a combination of antibiotics. however if you have a family history of toxocancer you may also be diagnosed with tbc. tbc is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bacterium toxoplasma. toxocarcoma is a common viral infection that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the infected cells. toxoplasms are caused by viruses that are transmitted from one person to another. toxoviruses are also caused by bacteria that live in the blood. when the immune system is attacked by a virus the body cannot fight off the infection. if you develop a tbc infection you may have a viral infection called toxoviral pneumonia. if your doctor prescribed a medication to treat toxocarpa you may need to take it. if the medication is not working for you it is important to

Question: how is c. difficile passed from person to person?
Answer: the answer is yes. c. efficile is passed from one person to another.
Expected Response: this is a very good question. clostridium difficile (or c. diff) is a highly contagious bacterium that is spread by direct contact. it's important to note that antiseptic hand cleaners are not effective against c. diff. good hand hygiene is extremely important in avoiding the spread of c. diff. if you are providing care for someone with c. diff you should consider wearing protective paper gowns and discarding them after each patient contact. try not to come in contact with any of the patient's feces (though c. diff gets spread onto pretty much all the surfaces a c. diff patient comes in contact with). wash your hands after every contact with a c. diff patient. to wash properly first turn on the water tap and wet your hands. then add soap and work into a vigorous lather. rinse the soap off thoroughly. dry thoroughly. (the drying part is very important because it helps ensure the bacteria don't linger in the wonderful moist skin environment. ) if you maintain good hand hygiene you can help avoid spreading this awful bacteria. hope this helps!

Question: we have seen a dr for my baby's very severe diaper rash and are using rx cream but nothing seems to work. she has had the rash for about 2 weeks in different states throughout. it has been the "1 step forward 2 steps" back sort of thing. she has open sores that have gotten to a point where they have shrunk but refuse to heal any more. she has also been on oral antibiotics for 3 days now. today the actual 'rash' part of it that we thought had finally gone away has resurfaced with a vengence. . please help with any suggestions.

Question: my husband is self-employed and we have a high deductible bcbs policy. . we are able to deduct cost of health insurance on taxes. if we were to get a policy through the marketplace would we lose that deduction? also i had a brief conversation with someone from bcbs who lead me to think that we will have to change policies. i was very confused.
Answer: you may have to do that. you can buy a new policy through your state's marketplace. you'll need to do it in your state.
Expected Response: if you get a policy through the marketplace you can still deduct the cost of insurance from your taxes. if you qualify for a subsidy that lowers your insurance costs the amount would be offset by the amount of the subsidy you receive. regarding the changing policies many existing insurance plans don't meet the requirements of the law. in that case you would be required to switch policies. and you would be best served to shop all of your options and not just move to the plan bcbs pushes you toward.

Question: what are the symptoms of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?
Answer: most helpful answer toxoplasma is a sexually transmitted disease. it is caused by a virus that causes the parasite to live on the skin. when a woman's immune system attacks the parasite it can cause a rash that looks like a rash. it can also appear as a rash on the face neck or arms or legs. toxoplasms can also be caused by other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Expected Response: in a person with a healthy immune system when first infected with toxoplasmosis most people don't get sick. a few people have mild flu -like symptoms which can last as long as several months. this is why people rarely know whether or when they have had toxoplasmosis. symptoms can include: swollen glands. muscle aches. fatigue. fever. sore throat. skin rash. in a newborn most infected newborns have no symptoms at birth. but without treatment some can develop eye or brain damage that ranges from mild to severe. blindness can develop up to 20 years after birth but this is rare. some infected newborns have severe symptoms at birth including: eye pain vision problems or blindness. brain damage leading to intellectual disability and occasionally seizures. in a person with a weak immune system a person who has a very weak immune system (weakened by hiv infection organ transplant medicines or lymphoma ) can develop life-threatening toxoplasmosis. antibiotic therapy is often used to prevent this from happening. severe infection requires aggressive treatment. in very rare cases otherwise healthy people who get toxoplasmosis can have severe symptoms related to the brain eyes lungs or heart. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Answer: treatment with chemotherapy is the best way to treat stage 2 cancer. chemotherapy is very expensive and may be more expensive than chemotherapy alone. however the most important thing is that you do not delay in getting treatment. you may be able to get treatment sooner or later.
Expected Response: am not sure what type of chemotherapy you will be receiving but this usually includes a platinum drug and a taxane drug. a description of chemotherapy side effects can be found on the women's cancer network web site. this site has been developed by the gynecologic cancer foundation and contains a lot of good information about ovarian cancer.

Question: can you inherit depression from your parents?
Answer: yes. depression is caused by a genetic predisposition to depression.
Expected Response: 1. depression may be inherited from family members. the more family you have that are depressed the more likely you will be. perhaps genetics is to blame for about 30% of depression where stress family upbringing trauma and personality style is the other 70%. 2. you may inherit genes for depression. you can also inherit the ability to respond to certain medicines that other family members respond too. so if your dad responded well to prozac your chances are good too as you likely have the same type of 'genetic' depression which was reversed by prozac in your dad. doctors should ask you if you have had a family history of depression and what meds your family took and their response to it.

Question: what is the strongest over-the-counter headache/pain reliever medicine?
Answer: the best over- the-counter pain reliever is the one you are using. the best pain reliever for people with migraines is the over-counter. it's a pain reliever that is a pain relievers that are better than the over the counter pain relieving pills. the over and under-the counter pain reliever can be very effective for a variety of conditions. you can try some over- and under the counter medications that are more effective for migraineurs. the pain reliever that you use is a combination of a pain medication and a pain medicine. it will work for a wide range of conditions including migrainis. if you are having pain in your neck or back that is caused by a migraine then you should see your doctor about using a migraine-free medication. the doctor will tell you what medications are best for you. i hope this helps!
Expected Response: there is no stronger over-the-counter medication for headache or migraine pain relief. headaches are very individualized. there are several over-the-counter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches. these medications include acetaminophen (tylenol) an effective over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) medication. this medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever. however it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties. this is important for some types of headache relief. in addition the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug class (nsaids) consists of products like ibuprofen (motrin advil) and naproxen (naprosyn aleve) which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. lastly combination products such as excedrin migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. these ingredients combined make a more powerful headache/pain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone. it is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity. monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication. if you're 18 or older advil migrane and excedrin migrane are really good. i don't know about all around pain relievers. advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fast-acting it also lasts all day. excedrin migrane is supposedly the safest and #1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine. also if you're not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please don't take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason.

Question: possible ingestion of pantry moth eggs & larvae is there a health risk? . pantry moths eggs & larvae ingestion health risk?
Answer: yes. this is a very common problem. it is very common in the united states. however in most cases the health of the person is not known until the eggs are found. there is no known risk to the health or well-being of the individual.
Expected Response: no i don't think you will experience any health consequences from ingesting a moth eggs or larvae. your gastrointestinal tract will likely do a fine job in digesting it safely. as you may know many societies eat all types of insects as part of their normal diet. most people do not choose to eat moths but i believe this would be harmless. my dog eats them all of the time and i suspect that i have inadvertently eaten a few in my life as well.

Question: 12 year old son has lump pain and clear fluid(when squeezed) in the right nipple. . no burising or discolorization. . he has been told he has a lump on the left nipple.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's not uncommon for a child to have a lump in the nipple that's not painful. it can be painful enough to cause a lump to appear. it may also be hard to swallow. it could be a sign of a bacterial infection or even a cyst. it is important to talk to your pediatrician or a doctor about this. you need to see a doctor for an examination. you should also talk to his doctor about getting a test done to see if this lump is a cystic or a cysts. if it's a cytic it may be a cytoma or even an infection. it would be wise to see your doctor as soon as possible so you can have this lump properly diagnosed and
Expected Response: most helpful answer he may have adolescent gynecomastia -- an unwelcomed hormonal gift associate with puberty. this is relatively common but an embarrassment to boys. don't get me wrong. teen boys admire breasts but they don't want to grow their own. you can find lots of information about this temporary condition on the internet so you both can read it. this condition can last about two years and can involve both breasts not just one. there is nothing medically that can be done to stop it and nearly all will eventually resolve. i have seen thousands in my practice and only one had to have surgery to remove this breast tissue. if he doesn't want to take off his shirt at home or wear one at the pool let him. don't let other siblings or friends tease him either.

Question: can i do 7 hour flight when 30 weeks pregnant with placenta circumsvalata? . hi i am 27 years old and pregnant at 24 weeks. last week i was told that i have placenta circumsvalata based on my 22 week fetal survey. i am also planning a move from east coast to west coast. does this condition cause any concern if i fly for 7 hours when i am 30 weeks pregnant? as i read most complications from this condition start happening after then. so far i am at 24 weeks never had spotting or any other complications baby growth and kick are all normal. thanks!

Expected Response: hi i have this from the uk’s nhs its all pretty standard stuff for flying but you have that extra problem i think like they say get this all in place before you even think about booking. before you travel. if you're planning on travelling by plane you should discuss this with your midwife or gp. before you book your tickets check with your airline and insurance company that they will allow you to travel while pregnant. after week 28 of the pregnancy most airlines require a letter from your midwife or gp confirming: that you're in good health that you have a normal pregnancy the expected date of delivery be aware that your gp may charge you for the letter. your gp surgery can give you more information about what their charges are. some airlines may require medical clearance if: your delivery date is less than four weeks after your departure date or any complications are expected in your delivery. this may involve your gp or midwife filling in a form or an assessment by the airline staff. check with your airline as the restrictions can vary. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what other medications are used for treating migraine headaches?
Answer: the most common migraine medications are migraine medications like razors and migraine medications that are used to treat other types of headaches such as migraines. migraine medications used for migraine headaches are: nystatin (generic name: nyu-zoloft). this medication is used to reduce the severity of migraine headaches. nysteine (generic: nys-zostatin). this drug is used for headache headaches.
Expected Response: narcotics and butalbital-containing medications sometimes are used to treat migraine headaches; however these medications are potentially addictive and are not used as initial treatment. they are sometimes used for individuals whose headaches fail to respond to over-the-counter medications but who are not candidates for triptans either due to pregnancy or the risk of heart attack and stroke. in patients with severe nausea a combination of a triptan and an antinausea medication for example prochlorperazine (compazine) or metoclopramide (reglan) may be used. when nausea is severe enough that oral medications are impractical intravenous medications such as dhe-45 (dihydroergotamine) prochlorperazine (compazine) and valproate (depacon) are useful.
================================================================================
Question: if your patient wanted to go off meds and had no major episodes of manic depression for a while what would you advise?
Answer: you can always ask your patient to see a psychiatrist for a referral to a psychiatrist.
Expected Response: it would depend on the patient. if they had a history of multiple significant manic or depressive episodes i would counsel them that their decision was very risky and probably ill-advised and warn them of the likelihood of relapse and clarify what their wishes would be should they relapse. in my experience in people with bipolar i disorder an eventual relapse off medicines is almost always inevitable and i don't know that there is any "natural" way to avoid that. i would encourage regular ongoing monitoring/visits and enlist their family as look-outs on the team. if they had a history of suicide attempts or hospitalization or psychosis in the last few years i would probably urge them against a very dangerous idea and personally not feel comfortable being cast as simply an onlooker to looming disaster. in someone who had a history of episodes long ago who's been stable for at least several years no suicide attempts functioning well they're responsible family is supportive no drugs or alcohol relationships and work are stable/steady and they know what to watch for and could catch a looming relapse quickly so we could nip it in the bud and were agreeable to resuming medicines at the first signs of relapse i would probably be much more encouraging.

Question: why does my nose run all the time? . its not all the time but it feels like its always running. i have noticed that im always sniffling or blowing my nosse. i also get a little tired. i think i have a cold or something.
Answer: hi just google nose run or nosebleeds and you find lots of info about it. good luck
Expected Response: sorry to hear of this. dealing with a constantly runny nose can be very annoying! the medical term for a runny nose is rhinitis. the runnyness is caused by inflammation of the nasal tissue. the most common type of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis. however it's possible to have the non-allergic variety too. another flavor of rhinitis is called gustatory rhinitis and this refers to getting a runny nose when you eat. other things can cause a runny nose such as exposure to cold weather. if you've never been diagnosed with nasal allergies this would be a good time to see your health care provider to determine if your runny nose is caused by allergies or not. if it is an over-the-counter or prescription medication may help dry up your nasal tissue. if your runny nose is not caused by allergies then your only option may be to invest in a lot of tissue. not the best news i know. hope this helps!

Question: is your heart pounding for hours a sign of anxiety attacks? . i have been having chest pains for about 3 weeks now. i am not sure if i should go to the er or not. i have not had any heartburn in 3 weeks.
Answer: i would go to your doctor. i would not go to an emergency room. i do not know your age or medical history.
Expected Response: it can but i never say it's anxiety until after there's been a full medical exam to rule out anything physical. you should consider doing this and also take a look to see if you might be experiencing undue stress lack of sleep or anything else that might have triggered this.

Answer: hi if you have been taking insulin for a long time then you should be ok. but if you are taking sugar then you need to be on some kind of diet that is low in fat and carbs. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you should never stop taking insulin unless specifically advised to do so by the medical provider who is treating your diabetes. and you should definitely not start eating sugar! if your blood sugar is normal perhaps it is because you are on the proper dose of insulin and you are now eating more appropriately. please call your doctor before thinking of making any changes in your medical regime.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's a tough situation. i wish you all the best with your journey! i'd recommend you talk to your health-care provider about whether or not you should be taking scizo berries (grapefruit) or if you should take any other medication that might interfere with your ability to take scizo fruit. you can talk to a pharmacist or pharmacist's office to discuss the pros and cons of each medication. i hope you feel better soon!
Expected Response: schisandra has the potential to interact with many different medications -- either increasing or decreasing the medication's effects in the body. be very careful taking this with your medications and don't take it without first checking with your doctor. as with many supplements we don't have enough information to know what effects it may have particularly in someone on medications like humira and methotrexate. medscape. com (its a site for physicians) has a free drug interaction checker that is really helpful. here's a link: <link> i hope this helps.

Question: who should receive the flu vaccine? when should someone get the flu shot?
Answer: the flu is not contagious. however if you have a fever or cough you may be exposed to the virus. if you are not taking the vaccine you should not receive the vaccine. if your doctor prescribes the vaccine he or she may give you a dose of the vaccine that is more specific. the vaccine is given in a dose that is less than the recommended dose for most people. if the dose is too high you may not receive it. if a person has a fever you should be vaccinated against the flu. if they have a cough you should receive a dose not recommended by the doctor. if there is a sore throat or other symptoms of the flu you should get the vaccine immediately. if someone has a sore foot you should also get the influenza vaccine.
Expected Response: i think everyone who can get the flue shot should get the flu shot.

Question: is any exercise safe while taking cipro? how long after 30 days of treatment should i wait before working with weights? . i have been working out for the last 2 years and find myself in decent shape for a 50 year old male. was starting a hardcore workout plan but have stopped. i have been having some urologic issues and after having multiple scans done the doctors are not seeing anything so my doctor has put me on cipro for 30 days. he specifically told me not to lift anything heavy due to possible tendon rupture and from what i see the risk continues even for several months after completing the medication.
Answer: i am not sure what you mean by "several months after completion of the medication". the only way to know if you are ok is to see a doctor. if you have a medical condition such as a heart attack or stroke it would be wise to see your doctor before you start any exercise program. if it is a serious injury you will need to see
Expected Response: i do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on cipro or for months after. any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns. since i do not know you full medical history it is best to get patient-specific exercise parameters from your doctor -- someone who does have this information.

Answer: vitamin d is not a vitamin. it is a mineral that is found in the blood. vitamin d can be found in most foods and in many different foods. vitamin b12 is found naturally in foods like broccoli cabbage and potatoes. vitamin c is found primarily in the skin. vitamin e is found mostly in the liver. vitamin f is found mainly in the stomach. vitamin g is found only in the intestines. vitamin h is found most naturally in the lungs. vitamin k is found usually in the kidneys. vitamin l is found all over the body. vitamin m is found just about anywhere. vitamin p is found anywhere in the body including the lungs and the heart. vitamin q
Expected Response: vitamin d from sunlight foods and even vitamin supplements is not biologically active. it has to undergo two processes the first occurring in the liver which converts vitamin d to the 25(oh)d form also known as calcidiol or vitamin d². the kidney then makes the most active form 1 25(oh)²d also known as calcitriol or vitamin d³. if you check your bottle of vitamins or calcium + vitamin d supplements you can see which type you have been taking. currently the preferred supplement form may be vitamin d³ as it increases the amount of active vitamin d while increasing the time vitamin d is active in the blood and tissues.

Expected Response: absolutely not! you may shower as much as you please. it will not cause your hair to thin or fall out. in fact good scalp hygiene is always a great idea to ward off yeast or bacteria that may occupy the hair follicle and possibly cause skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) or folliculitis.

Question: hi i'm 15 years old take nature-made b complex omega369 100mg ubiquinol daily is this okay? . i'm using nature-made super b-complex omega 3-6-9 and qunol 100mg ubuiquinol as alternative adhd medicine. i'm just concerned that these pills maybe detrimental. i've read the label on the nature-made super b-comples and it contains 6 667% daily value of thiamin 1 176% riboflavin and 250% b12. also the qunol has 100mg of pure coq10 (i've heard the reccomended amount was around 50mg) is this too much for my body to handle? should i cut the pills into smaller portions? please help! . thanks!
Answer: it sounds like you're taking the wrong dose of vitamin b12 for your body. i'd suggest you see a registered dietitian to see if there's any benefit to
Expected Response: i'm not sure why you are taking all those supplements but let's go down the list. i don't know of any evidence that shows that taking large amounts of b vitamins is beneficial or particularly harmful. if you don't eat fish twice a week taking fish oil high in omega 3 fatty acids dha and epa can help but americans get more than enough omega 6 fatty acids so i'm not sure why this would be needed in a supplement. there seems to be some research that qunol (coenzyme10) can help people who take cholesterol lowering medications who have lower levels in the body but not sure how it helps the general population. i'm not familiar with ubuiquinol but like any supplement check to see if there is any research to show its safety and effectiveness. supplements are not regulated by the fda so safety has to be demonstrated by the company. according to a recent study in pediatrics teenagers fall short on various nutrients including magnesium phosphorus and vitamins a c and e. so if you feel your diet is lacking include a multivitamin that provides 100% daily value for the majority of vitamins and minerals. many people (of all ages) need to supplement with vitamin d because they get little sunshine and foods are generally low in this vitamin. recommendations for calcium at your age are 1300mg because this is a peak time for bone growth. one cup of milk 1. 5 ounce cheese and 6-8 ounce yogurt contains about 300mg calcium so if you are falling short you may want to consider supplementation. no supplement can make up for a diet poor in nutrition. i always recommend a food first strategy but sometimes supplementation is needed to fill nutrition gaps. and most importantly make sure supplements have the research behind them to show they are safe and effective. always check with your healthcare provider about supplements you take.

Question: when am i no longer contagious? i caught a cold then three days later developed bronchitis. i understand the cold has a three-day contagiousness window--one day before you know you are ill and two days following. but what happens when the cold develops into bronchitis? am i contagious again when the bronchitis symptoms appear? bottom line: when am i clear to return to work so i do not infect others?

Question: what pills can reduce stomach fat and consistant bloating. a vegetarian and gluten free but still retain stomach fat and bloating i exercise regularly and drink plenty of water. looking for help.
Answer: i would suggest that you see a registered dietitian. he or she can help you to find out what foods are best for you and how to reduce your bloating and bloatings.
Expected Response: part of your bloating could be caused by your protein sources. beans and other legumes can cause that so can broccoli soy plenty of vegetables. they can be good for you but you might need some probiotic help or maybe some digestive enzymes. stomach fat won't leave just because you are vegetarian. you still have to exercise regularly (like you are doing) get enough protein to be healthy limit your sugars and starches and take in fewer calories than you burn. you might want to try a different form of exercise to help kick start your fat loss too. if you increase the intensity in what you already do interval fashion you might shock your body a bit and get it working harder. bodies are famous for getting used to an exercise and burning less calories while doing it.

Question: are eating carrots bad for people who are at-risk for macular degeneration? . my eye doctors have told me that i should stay away from eating carrots since there is a long history of macular degeneration in my family. almost everyone on my mothers side has had one kind or the other. is there any truth that eating carrots could be bad for you? i like to eat carrots but i am not a nut about eating them. i may have a several small ones with dinner now and again but that's it. thanks for your time.
Answer: i don't know if you are at risk for macul degeneration but it sounds like you are. there are many factors that can cause macul-related macular disease. if you have a family history of this disease you may have an increased risk of developing it. i would suggest you see a health care provider to get a diagnosis. you will need to have the disease diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: this is not something i've heard before and is not a typical diet recommendation. a variety of fruits and veggies are encouraged to help prevent macular degeneration especially leafy greens like spinach due to their high lutein content. at your next visit i suggest asking your eye doctors why they recommend no carrots so you can better understand the reasoning behind it. good luck!

Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor for a test but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: your husband's surgery may have nothing to do with his tinnitus or high blood pressure. it may have just happened as they often do was we age. rather than search for a reason or blame see an ent to evaluate the tinnitus (the cause and cure can be very difficult to find) and his primary care doctor to treat the high blood pressure (which incidentally can be one of the hundreds of causes of tinnitus). there are sooooo many different medical issues that may be involved it would be impossible to track them down over the internet.

Question: sometimes when i turn my neck sudden i get a very sharp pain almost like a jolt up the back of my head to my brain. i have had this jolting pain in my neck for a few years now and it only happens every now and again and only when im turning my head really fast. then i get a feeling like a jolt of electricity up the side of my neck and up my head it makes me feel blind and disoraintated for about 30 seconds. i havent really paid it much attention because after that it stops and dosent hurt but i just recently had another one and it was the worse jolt yet and its lingered in my neck now for a couple hours. i also have a very small bruise on my left side that i can't see. i can see it but it's hard to see.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm sure you're aware that neck pain can be a symptom of
Expected Response: i'm sorry you experience this. it doesn't sound pleasant that's for sure! whenever a patient describes pain with words like "jolt of electricity " we tend to think in terms of nerve pain. only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like x-rays or mri can say for sure what's going on with your neck. that said i would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly. this type of neck pain can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae (spinal bones) of your neck. while i don't think this situation is an emergency i would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon. catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome. you can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling. hope this helps! i do that all the time. even in bed. go see a chiropractor! i wouldn't want to live without one since i started seeing one. usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes. also ice packs to the area help with the pain. this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine i am a yoga guru in india. been in the field for 12 yrs. i also have been suffering from arthritis for some time in the neck hands and low back. believe me i am not taking any medicine. i have been able to manage only with yogaanasas yoga nidra or corpe pose. you have to learn from an expert and not self learn. it is a good pain reliever. my website is srimadhwayoga. com yoga guru i have had this exact pain since i was a little girl (5 or 6). im now 18. i used to go to doctors all the time and no one ever knew what to do. it hasnt happened for about 3 years but it is now happening monthly. did you have any luck finding out what is causing this pain?

Question: can stress and anxiety cause ibs. recently had colonscopy and endoscopy everything fine. . stomach always feeling funny. . i have been having bad stomach cramps. i have tried to get on meds but they hurt so bad. i am trying to get off of ibs but i am not sure if i can get off without a prescription.
Answer: ibs is a chronic condition that is caused by a number of things. it can be caused by many things including medications (such as ibs) medications that can cause inflammation (such a medication can cause a yeast infection) medications (like ibs). medications that cause inflammation can also cause an increase in blood pressure. medications that increase blood pressure can also increase the risk of heart disease. for more on these and other conditions see this webmd article.
Expected Response: the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that "comes and goes. " usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were "fine" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is -- if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well!

Question: why do i keep gaining massive amounts of weight in a short period of time? . i weighed 120 most of my life. gained 40lbs. in 2 months. i lost it in about a year and then kept it off for 2 years. in the past 3 months i have gained 30lbs. my diet had not changed much. i eat a vegetable with every meal i do not eat much. the only difference was that i ate fried food/starchy food a little more often(not much of it). i did not eat enough to gain 30lbs. i am 25 years old. i have ibs gerd. i know my hormones are out of whack but never finished testing. what is wrong?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. weight gain is a very common and painful process. it's not uncommon for people to lose weight in the short term because they're afraid to exercise or to eat healthy. it can be difficult to see how you
Expected Response: i can't really offer you a patient-specific answer over the internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue. you do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weight-control specialist (baritrician). you are eating more than you body needs. this is the only way (other than water retention) that a mammal (you) can put on large amounts of weight. we do not pull calories from the air. while it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only 500 calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale; a 1000 calorie a day increase could at two pounds a week. the first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary. write down everything you eat including the amounts/weight and their determine their caloric content. your doctor will likely need this information. it is important that you burn the calories that you take in. this may be something that you fail to do. you may speak with dr. schweiger a board certified dermatologist who can help you with an effective way to reduce unwanted body fats.

Answer: hi it sounds like you have a problem with urination. if you urinate in a lot of places then it could be a urinary tract infection or you could have a urinary infection. if your urine is cloudy or cloudy it could just be a urine problem. but if you do have
Expected Response: frequency of urination needs a medical investigation including an examination and blood/urine tests to rule out diabetes mellitus. see your primary care care provider first. if your tests are normal then you will need to see a urologist. this problem can be fixed but a cause will need to be medically-determined first.

Question: what causes osteoporosis?
Answer: osteoporsosis is a condition in which bones that are in close contact with the skin are severely damaged. the most common cause of osteoporisosis is an accumulation of abnormal bone cells called osteoporiatic cells. these cells are called osteoblasts. osteoporegonosis is often referred to as a "reproductive disorder. " osteoporesis is a disease in which bone in the spine is not growing as well as bone in other parts of the body. osteoarthritis is a common condition in women. it is caused by a deficiency of bone mineral density (bmd) which means that the bones of the spine are not growing. osteoblast deficiency can lead to osteopontosis. the bone in your spine is also affected by the type of osteoarthropoietin (oet) that your doctor prescribed. osteoclast deficiency is caused in about one third of women. the disease can
Expected Response: with age bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin. for women the loss of bone density speeds up during the first five to seven years after menopause when there is a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. factors that increase a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis include: being thin or having a small frame. having a family history of osteoporosis. having the ovaries removed. smoking drinking more than moderately or living a sedentary lifestyle. white and asian women are more frequently affected than african-american and hispanic women. certain medical conditions such as kidney disease cushing's syndrome and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid gland increase bone breakdown. glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory drugs) anti-seizure drugs and prolonged immobility due to paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss.

Question: would it be pointless to visit a doctor years after contracting lyme disease? . i was bitten by a tick a few years ago and was left with the bullseye rash that signifies lyme disease but i didn't see a doctor because i didn't know about the disease. i've had some symptoms that i suppose could be related (wrist pain muscle aches trouble sleeping) but would it be worth going now that my symptoms are so vague?
Answer: i would not go to a doctor unless you have a very specific medical condition. i would suggest you visit a dermatologist for a consultation.
Expected Response: you should see a doctor specializing in lyme disease no matter how long ago that the rash was first observed. if you have lyme disease it can be and still needs to be treated. over 300 000 individuals per year are infected with lyme disease. the condition requires antibiotic treatment to eliminate all bacteria in order to stop further bodily organ damage. this bacteria will fester in the body forever until treated completely. the lyme disease process may start out with a skin rash fatigue and fever and be dismissed as being somewhat annoying but not being worthy of medical intervention. some later stage symptoms of the condition include heart damage neurological defects arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. best wishes for your improved health.

Question: can a child get sickle cell trait from their grandparents or great grandparents if their parents dont have it? . my first son was born with sickle cell trait and i was wondering if it was possible to have gotten it from someone else other than his parents. i know i don't have it but my husband has no clue. so i was wondering if it deffenatly came from my husband or possibly the childs grandparents or great grandparents.
Answer: hi yes you can get it from your grandparents or grandparents. but your not alone. there are many other things that can happen to you. and your not sure what to do. good luck
Expected Response: sickle cell trait is a genetic disorder that occurs when a child inherits one sickle cell gene from a parent. if a child inherits two sickle cell genes (one from each parent) then that child will have sickle cell disease. so to answer your question if your son has been diagnosed with sickle cell trait then he had to have inherited a sickle cell gene from one of his parents. if you his mother know positively you don't have sickle cell trait (which is diagnosed by blood test) then your son must have received the gene from his father. sickle cell trait may never produce symptoms so you should not assume you don't have it unless you've been tested for it. your son needs to be aware that he can pass along this sickle cell gene to his own child. if the child's mother also has sickle cell trait (or sickle cell disease) the child can be born with sickle cell disease. hope this helps!

Question: what are side effects after liposuction. pink color patches on the skin round liposuction area.
Answer: hi if you have had a good look at the link below it should give you some good information. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: liposuction is generally considered safe but people should understand there are now several different "flavors" of liposuction. these include traditional "tumescent" liposuction non-invasive cryoliposuction (cool lipo) and laser liposuction. the answer to your question depends a bit on what type of liposuction you had done. if you had traditional (tumescent) liposuction in which fluid was injected under your skin before the fat being sucked out with a metal wand called a cannula then pinkness around the cannula sites may not be unusual. if the pink spots are near the incision sites this also may simply be normal bruising. with traditional liposuction there is always some level of bruising to the treated areas afterwards. because you have questions about these pink patches i'd suggest you call the surgeon who performed your liposuction procedure to find out what's going on. he or she is in the best position to tell you if you're experiencing normal healing or if something else is going on. wishing you all the best! hello this is really a good question here we have some of the most common side effects of liposuction: scars swelling bruises pain reduced mobility just to make it clear side effects differ from complications in the fact that the side effects always take place after an invasive liposuction surgery while complication may never appear! as for the pink patches can you please tell me which liposuction technique did you opt for (tumescent ultrasonic laser etc) for more info on the side effects have a look here: <link>#side_effects

Question: can i bring my 88 year old father who has stage iv copd to denver where the altitude is 5500 feet. i would like my dad to come live his last days out with me. i certainly don't want to be the cause of his death but he is miserable where he is. is it worth the risk? we have an excellent oxygen concentrator that gives him a good pulse burst and he does breathing treatments. he wouldn't have to do anything that would cause over exertion. is it worth the risk?
Answer: hi i think you should do that. good luck
Expected Response: you ask a fascinating question and one that is very worthy of discussing with your dad's physician. i tried to search for some relevant studies on this topic and did not find very many. in general people with copd do worse at high altitudes whether they have lived at altitude for a long term or not. the issues with ventilation at altitude are more complex than simple oxygen delivery. there also are issues of breathing mechanics and heart function that come into play. all of this is not to say you should not move your dad to be with you in denver. i'm saying it could be manageable if you discuss it in advance with some good doctors and learn what things you need to do to manage your dad's condition at high altitude. or you might both decide the risks are too great. my personal opinion is that quality of life matters more than quantity of life -- especially when a person reaches an advanced age. i would suggest you consult with your father's doctor (or with a physician in denver) to find out if the benefits for your dad would outweigh the risks. wishing you well!
================================================================================
Question: is there anything in the law that will help patients with chronic conditions better afford their medications?
Answer: the law will not change the way patients with cancer can receive medications. it will not make it easier for patients to take their medications. the law also will not force doctors to make changes to their prescribing practices. the fact that some people with cancer have better access to the medications they need is a good thing.
Expected Response: it's important to look closely at each plan's drug benefits. it will take a little bit of work but choosing the right plan based on the medications you take could save a lot of money. all the health plans offered will provide prescription drug coverage. however not all plans are the same. each state will cover various medications differently. that's why it's important to do your best to match up your medicines with the right plan for you. your doctor may also help you pick a plan that's likely to cover any medicines you may need in the future. however like many of us doctors are learning about the new law and what it covers as we go. webmd has an excellent article that can provide more information on presciption drug costs and health reform.

Question: how do i know if i have a kidney stone?
Answer: if you have a renal stone (a kidney stone) you are at a higher risk for developing kidney stones. if you do not have a stone you may have a low-grade infection.
Expected Response: kidney stones usually show themselves through some specific symptoms though they only way to diagnose them for sure is through one or several tests such as a ct scan. if you're having any of these symptoms it's worth seeking medical attention: urge to urinate frequently possibly with little urine output sharp pains in the flanks or lower abdomen sometimes radiating toward the groin pacing the floor due to pain and the inability to find a comfortable position to sit or lie down in blood in the urine nausea and/or vomiting with the flank pain these are the classic signs of a kidney stone though other conditions can cause similar symptoms. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a mild-to-moderate basis you'd do well to make an appointment with your primary care provider. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a severe basis or if you find yourself nearly unable to urinate then a trip to urgent care or the emergency room is in order. only a health care provider can say for sure if you have kidney stones. i wish you well!

Answer: hi if you have any questions you can google gluten free diet and see how it works. good luck
Expected Response: it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian diets—ones that include eggs and dairy –or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat diet—just don’t go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website <link> also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.

Question: when is your blood pressure to low? and when is your pulse to high? . i was recently put on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. i am concerned because i am staying tired and sleepy. i keep a check on my blood pressure but would like to know what is considered to low. also my pulse rate ranges from 70's to 90's. has hit 100 and 103 a couple times. what is a safe pulse rate?
Answer: hi it is best to go see your doctor or uk's doctor for a blood test. good luck
Expected Response: you're wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for high blood pressure. doing this will help your health care provider titrate (fine-tune) your medication dosage appropriately. clinically low blood pressure is defined as anything under 90/60. (this can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual. ) if you've been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 90/60 as being too low. a normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. it's not unusual for a person's heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise. if you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider. because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment. there are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isn't working for you your doctor can try something else. i wish you all the best!

Question: i was just informed by my healthcare provider that they aren't accepting any health insurance marketplace plans. . i live in the state of texas and that seems to be the shared opinion of this state and its health care clinics. what would you suggest i do?
Answer: you can shop for a plan in your area at healthcare. gov.
Expected Response: it is true that not all providers will be participating in all the plans offered through the marketplace. one of the ways insurance companies operate is by only contracting with providers who are willing to accept their terms. you may want to change providers to one who is in one of the plans offered in the marketplace. if you do not want to change plans you should compare what kind of out-of-network coverage each of the plans offers.

Question: how can i keep my lips moist? they’re too dry.
Answer: i’m not sure what you mean by moist. if you’ve got dry lips then you may be able to moisturize them. but if you are moisturizing them dry lips are not necessarily dry. dry lips can be dry enough that they can be easily irritated. dryness is not a sign of dryness. dry skin is not the same as dryness in the mouth. dry mouth is a sign that you have a problem with the tongue.
Expected Response: for simply dry lips use an emollient that contains a sunblock. for cases of resistant dehydrated lips you may apply an over-the-counter hydrocortisone ointment (not cream) to your lips.

Answer: yes. the acai says that the health insurance marketplace must cover a minimum of 75% of the cost of a health plan through the marketplace. if you buy a plan through your state's marketplace you'll pay a premium of about $285 per year. if your state doesn't cover the cost you'll have to pay a penalty of about a quarter of the premium you're charged.

Question: i have to force myself to eat i havent ate much in a week. so far this week i have ate a half bowl of oatmeal two sandwiches and some fries and its thursday my parents are worried i think and so am i. i am overweight and 13 so could it be my brain saying "hey fatty stop eating"? any help would be much appreciated! thanks!
Answer: hi i would say you should get to your doctor and have your blood work done. ok good luck
Expected Response: be happy of your body but also believe it is what you make of it! not eating is not a reaction by your brain instead eating is encouraged in order to meet the vitamins nutrients and protein your body needs to get through the day and promotes brain functions. not eating can also cause problems to the functions of your hypothalamus. if there has been any new medications in your regimen maybe that is a problem. i would encourage an exercise program as it has helped me in a daily routine of eating. exercise is necessary among individuals whether you are overweight or not due to the release of endorphins which is food for your brain and makes you feel better. i was able to trim 6% body fat in 3 months due to a steady exercise program of 6 days a week and i am even eating 5 meals a day to keep my calorie intake high. i would suggest the first week starting slower with 3 days a week in order to loosen your muscles. stretching is also a very important key to a successful workout in which should be done before and after. the best advice is to not give up on yourself. losing weight and eating healthy takes time to adjust but noticing results will help your morale and motives on a daily basis. your diet is the most important thing and needs adjusting in a more strict regimen of what and when to eat. if you begin exercising running for a half hour will burn roughly 300-500 calories depending on speed. keep in mind that is simply a large fry from mcdonalds. completely cut all of those greasy foods out and begin eating healthier to feel better. boosting metabolism is a great way to start so drinking a coffee or green tea in the morning is a great way to do so. no soda. milk is necessary for calcium but stay away from the fats! try almond milk for lower fat content and higher calcium water is a great thing to drink as it keeps you hydrated and well. breakfast: possible one-a-day for key nutrients and vitamins otherwise get cereal with vitamins and nutrients. my favorite is post grape nuts which has a lot of the vitamins required for a daily intake along with protein. oatmeal is also another good way to jump start your day. eggs are a great breakfast food for the proteins and omega-3. lunch: my personal go to is a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread greek yogurt and banana. tuna fish sandwich is also a good lunch meal dinner: be creative! pasta and chicken that is not breaded is very good for glutamine and starch for energy. quinoa is my personal favorite as it contains every essential amino acid (really good cooked in chicken brother instead of water). rice is another good one and i also prefer fish. these foods and more such as split peas and soy beans will help you keep a healthy balanced diet which will lower your sugar and saturated fat intake. i really hope this helps as it has changed my life greatly!

Question: is it possible to receive nerve damage from a finger prick blood collection?
Answer: yes. if you have a nerve injury you can get it from a nerve-sparing injury. the nerve injury is not caused by a nerve infection.
Expected Response: not very likely. a finger prick is done at the peripheral end of the finger pad so there are few nerves that are located here. i can hurt yes but true nerve damage would be very unlikely.

Question: how long until z-pack works for strep? started yesterday and throat is still hurting bad. i'm allergic to penicillin so was prescribed a z-pack. i took the two pills yesterday morning took dose two (one pill) today. i know it's only been one day but i was of course hoping it would magically disappear. i haven't had strep since i was a child and this has been absolutely miserable.
Answer: yes. it's possible that you are allergic to z-pills. if you are not allergic to the penicillins you should take them with a prescription. you can get a prescription from your local pharmacy for the same medication.
Expected Response: most helpful answer the medical provider who is treating you for strep is not really doing it correctly. if you do a brief search on "treating strep with azithromycin" you will see that the standard z-pack is not sufficient. strep should be treated with two pills (500mg) every day for five days; twice the dose you have been given. the purpose of any antibiotic in the treatment of lab-diagnosed strep (i hope you had a confirmation test to prove you did indeed have strep) is to prevent complications. not to treat the associated pain. antibitoics are not good pain medications so i would suggest that you take an appropriate dose of ibuprofen or have your medical provider prescribe something for you.

Question: how do l deal with pain from gall bladder infection or gallstones?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i hope you're feeling better soon. the gallstones are a common problem in people with gallstones. gallstones can cause a lot of pain and discomfort. but the gallbladder is a very important part of your body. it's your body's way of getting rid of plaque. it makes sure you have a healthy diet and exercise. it also helps prevent and treat other common symptoms of gallstones such as: pain in the abdomen (for example a painful pain in your abdomen after a bowel movement) pain in other parts of the body such as the legs or feet. gallstone pain in a person with a weakened immune system. gallbladders are a great way to treat a variety of symptoms of a gallstone such as pain in one or both of the legs. gall stones can also cause a variety: pain with the anus or rectum.
Expected Response: i'm not sure from your question if you've been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if you're self-diagnosing. it's important to know. gallstones can be very painful. if stones accumulate or block the bile duct surgery must be performed to remove the gallbladder. it is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder. if you only suspect your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain. many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. if your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage. i'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your abdomen. that's never fun. wishing you well!

Answer: hi have you had any tests done? good luck
Expected Response: your behind is made up of three muscles that comprise the glutes: gluteus maximus -- the largest glute and one of the strongest muscles in the human body; then gluteus minimus and medius. it’s the maximus that gives your bottom its shape and is integral to almost every movement we take. the glutes are covered by a layer of subcutaneous fat. how much fat you carry is dictated by genetics as well as lifestyle.

================================================================================
Question: is there a federal requirement to test tissue removed from a benign lesion?
Answer: the american college of surgeons is the only national association that has a national certification system. if you have a benign cyst (cancerous tissue) removed from the lesion you can use a blood test to see if you are at risk for cancer. if not you can ask your surgeon to perform a blood culture for you.
Expected Response: i am not exactly sure if i understand your question but i do not believe there are any federal regulations that require a medical provider to test tissue removed from a lesion however it is common sense to do so. the only way to know with certainty if a removed or biopsied lesion is benign or malignant is to send it to pathology for a microscopic analysis so most medical providers do this as a standard of care practice not because of any federal requirement.
================================================================================
Question: how is a cataract treated?
Answer: cataracts are not treated. catarctomy is the removal of the cataractic lesions of the eye. catarsact removal surgery is a surgical procedure that removes the cat's outer cornea and replaces it with a tube of blood to be used in the eye for a number of years. cataring surgery is not a cure for catarax but it can be used to treat other conditions such as eye cancer.
Expected Response: the symptoms of early cataract may be improved with new eyeglasses brighter lighting anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. if these measures do not help surgery is the only effective treatment. surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. a cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities such as driving reading or watching tv. you and your eye care professional can make this decision together. sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. for example a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. if you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times usually four to eight weeks apart.

Question: what is the relation between high blood pressure and high heart/pulse rate? . i have read that when the volume of blood is high the bp rises and the pulse slows down and vice versa however in my case the bp rises when when pulse rate increases. can you please explain this relation in bp and pulse in detail. . . . thanks. . . . osman
Answer: hi if you have high blood pressures you can get a high blood sugar with high blood sugars from the diet. this is why you should get a blood sugar monitor for your blood sugar. good luck
Expected Response: osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: " a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. " other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful.

Question: how long does it take to show symtoms after having intercourse with someone who has genitle herpes? . also if they haven't had a outbreak in 5-10 years and show no signs of the disease can you still get it? lastly can you get the disease from oral sex if they have no symptoms?
Answer: hi if you have had the virus for 5 years you can get it from oral or vaginal sex and not get it through oral sex. but you would need to get it done for sure. good luck
Expected Response: there is no easy or definitive answer. expose to someone with active (visible fresh lesions) herpes the outbreak on the exposed person can be relatively fast. when genital herpes is dormant (no visible signs of the disease) the chance of exposure is considerably less but unfortunately not zero. many people who have contracted herpes were not aware that their partner was infected and ended up contracting it in this dormant stage so we do know that this virus can be shed even when lesions are not present.

Question: are there special things you should do to protect your teeth when you have braces but grind your teeth?

Expected Response: most patients in braces that continue to grind can wear a special nighttime appliance to protect their teeth. i would discuss this with the orthodontist treating you with braces.

Answer: it is not possible to know for sure if you are taking cephalosporins or not since your medical provider cannot determine if you have any health issues based on your medical history. you can take ciprone if you feel like it. if you do not feel like taking it you should talk to your doctor about it.

Question: lower half of my body is ice cold. top half hot. what could cause this?
Answer: ice cold is not the cause of coldness. coldness is caused by viruses. cold viruses are viruses that live in the body. colds are caused by bacteria that live on the skin. cold sores are caused when the body's immune system attacks the virus that causes colds. cold conditions are more common in people who have a family history of colds and who have been exposed to the virus. cold symptoms can include fever headache muscle aches and muscle ache. cold soreness can also be caused by the virus or by a cold sore. cold skin conditions can also cause an increase in blood pressure. cold and flu symptoms can occur as a result of the virus (such as a fever headache sore throat or headache) or as a symptom of a cold virus (for example a sore throat). colds can also occur in people with a family or close family member who has a

Answer: yes you can take both at the exact same time.
Expected Response: meloxicam is a prescription strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) while acetaminophen (tylenol) is an effective analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). aleve is an over-the-counter nsaid. i would not take aleve while taking meloxicam due to the increased risk of side effects and toxicity issues. if you need to take a pain reliever in addition to the meloxicam i would stick with the acetaminophen. if this doesn’t alleviate the migraine/headaches then i would consult your health care professional about the cause of the migraines and what can be used to treat the symptoms. meloxican & tylenol : meloxican(mobic) is a nsaid it's an antiinflamatory that decreases swelling. tylenol is an analgesic and used for acute pain. so they go hand in hand especially if you just injured something like a knee ankle something like that. take mobic at same time each day to even the blood and it's better to take with food. tylenol can be used as needed for pain. you can take meloxicam and tylenol together but i would not recommend that you take meloxicam and aleve together. refer here <link> can i take tylenol with meloxicam?

Question: when i swallow i sometimes get crackling in my ear. is this an ear infection or just wax please help!
Answer: the ear infection is not caused by a wax allergy. it is caused by the bacteria that live in the ear canal. if you are not allergic to wax your ear may be a bit sensitive to it. if your ear is sensitive to wax you may be able to get a wax infection. if it is not wax you should see your medical provider for a medical evaluation.
Expected Response: ear infections (middle ear infections) typically cause pain and often fever. if you are not experiencing these symptoms it is not very likely you have an ear infection. crackling sounds in the ear can be caused by many things; when the eustachian tubes (a tiny ventilation tube that runs from your middle ear - the area on the other side of your eardrum) equalizes pressure you may hear a pop or crackling sound. fluid (effusion) in the middle ear can cause crackling. yes even a wax impaction lying against the eardrum or a stray hair can do this. less commonly other middle ear and inner ear disorders can cause this sensation. the only way you can begin to pinpoint the cause is to see your medical provider or an ent for a hands-on examination. treatment would depend on on your diagnosis. i have the same thing crackling sound in ears i think it to do with my jaw but how? same herre?

Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. it sounds like you are taking a medication that may be causing your hypertension. i would suggest you contact your health care provider or a doctor to get the details of your situation. the best thing you can do is make an appointment with your health insurance company. he or she can help you determine what medication you need and what you should do. if you are having trouble getting your medication in the morning or at night it is important to talk to your health plan before you begin taking it. it is best to talk with your provider about

Question: any ideas on whats causing my knee replacement to hurt so bad read below. i am 6 months recovering from knee replacement and my knee is worse now than before surgery. it buckles very unstable shooting pains swelling the more i stay on it worse it gets its is a zimmer flex lps gender specific any ideas. i have currently made a second opinion appointment as my current doctor says xrays are fine and he does 75 to 100 a year and i should take all my records and go see someone else so any imput will help. thank you.
Answer: hi try this google natural ways out of knee pain and arthritis you will find lots of info about natural ways to deal with the pain. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i think you're wise to get a second opinion. whether or not the x-rays look "fine " the truth is you're symptomatic. you deserve to learn why you're having problems. the main reason i wanted to respond though is to suggest you take your temperature. if you have a fever i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for some blood work. a fever can be a sign of infection and infection of a prosthetic knee is always a possibility. if you do have an infection you'd want to get that treated as soon as possible. while you're waiting for your appointment with the second doctor i'd suggest you use an assistive device to help stabilize your balance so you don't fall. either a 4-point cane or a walker would be ideal. the last thing you want is to sustain an injury before you get your knee problem figured out. wishing you all the best and hoping you feel better soon!

Question: are these symptoms of pregnancy? . 3 weeks ago i had some vaginal spotting i only noticed it when i went to the toilet. now my period is 2 weeks late. i have done 2hpt both negative. ive also had very watery discharge and some mild cramps but not like menstrual cramps. i have also been very tired aswell sleeping 8 hours at night and then a few hours in the afternoon. i have felt quite sick & feel quite sensitive to some smells. does this sound like i could be pregnant and the pregnancy tests did not detect the hcg hormone?
Answer: hi if you have had your period for 2 weeks then this could be your period. but do you think you are pregnant? good luck
Expected Response: home pregnancy tests are very accurate. if you're 2 weeks late and have had 2 negative tests it's unlikely that you're pregnant. many of the symptoms you mention would be quite unusual so early in pregnancy or are not typically associated with pregnancy at all so i would not assume that's what's going on. you should see your doctor to see what is going on as it doesn't sound like pregnancy is the most likely thing at this point.

Question: what kind of snacks would you recommend for people who are diabetic?
Answer: you can try: yogurt and fruit smoothies. try: fruit smoothie and yogurt. try apple cider vinegar and honey. try a lemonade with honey.
Expected Response: a diet to help control diabetes is often individually prescribed -- based on body weight and lifestyle -- to help keep blood sugar levels in control. the best snacks for diabetics will contain some protein and some fiber to help slow down food absorption and therefore help control blood sugar levels and prevent spiking. avoid simple sugars such as in cookies and candies and choose whole grain crackers low-fat cheeses maybe a slice of turkey or leftover chicken. and pair these foods with a small amount of fruit if desired. know that fruit while healthy can be high in natural sugars that will spike blood sugar levels unless combined with a protein source to slow down their absorption in your body.

Question: do you get a shot if you have pneumonia. my boyfriend told me he has pneumonia he went to urgent care & they tested him for mono as well do you normally recive a shot for pneumonia?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's hard to tell what to do. it sounds like you're having a bad reaction to antibiotics. i'd suggest you get this checked out. if you're still having symptoms you can get a blood test done to see if you can pass the stool test. if not you can take a stool sample and see if it's positive. if it isn't positive you can try a blood work up to see what's going on. if your symptoms are severe you may need to see your doctor. i hope this helps!
Expected Response: no pneumonia is usually treated without the indignity and pain of an (antibiotic? ) injection. there are many types and severity of pneumonia but if they medical provider assumed that he had a bacterial type these can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. sometimes with younger children who may be vomiting (not good candidates for oral medications) or those with severe pneumonia i will give an antibiotic injection. they are not happy about it but getting them better is the most important goal. there is a shot to prevent many types of pneumonia (pneumococcal)? i had one this morning!

Question: small bump in groin area? lymph node fatty deposit cyst? please look. hi i have had a bump in my groin area just above where the upper thigh meets the groin for about 4 months. this bump is hard and about the size of a bb and has no color change cannot be seen only felt it is not painful at all and has not changed in size. one thing that may be helpful to know is that i can actually completely pinch this little bump in my skin fold and when i do that i can feel nothing behind it. any help would be greatly appreciated! thanks <positive_smiley>

Expected Response: you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this lump properly examined. a description is never sufficient information when making an accurate diagnosis. as much as i would like to help you it would not be in your best interest to make blind guesses over the internet. i understand totally and thanks for responding. i am aware it could be many different things. i should have been a little more clear on what i wanted to know and that is can a lymph node be totally pinched off in the skin fold? i always thought that they were a little deeper below the skin. as i mentioned i can completely pinch this bump in the skin and can feel nothing directly beneath it when i do. not looking for an actual diagnosis that i know is not possible over the internet just want to know if its possible to completely pinch a lymph node in the skin as mentioned. thanks very much! thanks for responding. wouldn't a hair follicle or blind spot have a little redness or pain to it though? this little bump is very hard small and completely painless and un noticeable to the eye. i have only noticed it the last 4 months but have no idea on how long it has actually been there for. kind of found it by accident really. thanks again! hi after reading your post and reply it could just be a blind spot or the site of a hair follicle that's growing inwards it happens hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my dad suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma doc prescribed sorafenib tablets. is it gonna work?
Answer: no. sorafenzin is not a cure for hepatoleukemia. it is a medication that is not recommended for use in people with hepatoeloma.
Expected Response: i'm very sorry to hear about your dad. this must be a difficult time for you and your family. hepatocellular carcinoma as you probably know is liver cancer. sorafenib is a medication (chemotherapy drug) designed to slow the spread of cancer cells. it probably will not cure the cancer but it may help slow down the disease. if your dad or your family has questions about any of the medications the doctor is prescribing you should feel free to make an appointment to discuss the issue. some questions you might want to ask are: what does this medication do? what is the goal of this drug therapy? how should this drug be taken? what are possible side effects of this medication? are there other medications that could be used? if so why are you choosing this particular drug? what happens if the drug does not work as expected? what would the "next step" be? sorafenib has produced good results during clinical trials in terms of extending survival rates of people with liver cancer. i am hoping your dad is among the many who benefit from this treatment. i wish you and your family all the best!

Question: what's the best way to shave my face?
Answer: shaving your face is the best thing you can do to shave your face. if you have a lot of acne you can shave it but you may need to shave a bit more. if your skin is dry and your skin looks dry it may be better to shave it. you may also want to shave at night. if it's hot or humid you can use a shaving cream that contains salicylic acid and a mild detergent.
Expected Response: most men shave their face on a daily basis; here are a few tips for a more comfortable shave. the best time to shave is after you shower. the warm water allows the pores to open and also softens facial hair before shaving. always apply a shaving cream or shave gel to prepare your skin before shaving. using a shave brush (natural bristles are best) instead of your hands is the best way to apply your shaving cream. a shaving brush will help your whiskers to stand up and will result in a closer shave; using your hands will actually push the hair down. as you shave go with the grain not against it. this will help to prevent hair bumps from forming. the top layer of skin is exfoliated as you shave; therefore it is important to moisturize your skin after you shave. this will replace any moisture that was taken away during shaving. it is best to use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful uv rays.

Answer: if you have chlamydial infection you should take 1-2 doses of sulfamecam per day. if you are taking sulfamefib for a vaginal yeast infection you may want to take 2-3 doses of trimethorone per day for a yeast infection. if your symptoms are severe you may need to take a second dose of sulfa. if the symptoms are mild you may take a third dose of triclosan (for a vaginal infection) or a second sulfa-containing antibiotic.

Question: i am trying to stay away from glucose. i need a food plan that doesn't have glucose.

Expected Response: it is uncommon to follow a low glucose diet as it is found in many carbohydrate foods and a true allergy is rare. table sugar or sucrose is made up of two simple sugars fructose and glucose. fruits and vegetables also contain both fructose and glucose. lactose the sugar in milk is made up of the simple sugars glucose and galactose. glucose is also part of corn syrup high fructose corn syrup honey and other syrups. you may have been advised to follow a low sugar diet or low glycemic diet. that would mean choosing whole foods without added sugars such as fruits vegetables whole grains lean meats unsweetened dairy products. check labels for words that are code for sugar such as maltose dextrose brown rice syrup high fructose corn syrup malt syrup molasses cane sugar corn sweetener raw sugar fruit juice concentrate syrup honey and evaporated cane juice. for more on hidden foods with added sugars see this article <link> this article reviews a low glycemic diet <link> always check with a healthcare provider when following a restricted diet.

Expected Response: managing stress can play an important role in combating cancer-related fatigue. here are some suggestions that may help. adjust your expectations. for example if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. a sense of accomplishment goes a long way to reducing stress. help others understand and support you. family and friends can be helpful if they can "put themselves in your shoes" and understand what fatigue means to you. cancer groups can be a source of support as well. other people with cancer understand what you are going through. relaxation techniques such as audiotapes that teach deep breathing or visualization can help reduce stress. activities that divert your attention away from fatigue can also be helpful. for example activities such as knitting reading or listening to music require little physical energy but require attention. if your stress seems out of control talk to a health care professional.

Answer: hi look this link from webmd it could help you. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: interestingly yes the two things could be related. and you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can. under certain circumstances it's possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye. this is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse. usually though this sort of situation occurs when there's a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself. thus the symptoms you're experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye. while this isn't an emergency i'd recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out what's going on. no sense taking chances with your vision! best to you!

Question: after working out i sometimes get a pain in my backside. it seems similar to sciatica. how can i ease this pain?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with sciatic arthritis. it's not something you can treat blindly over the internet. it sounds like you're experiencing a common cold or flu. you need to see a doctor so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. if you're having pain in your backside it's probably because you're using a nerve-racking nerve stimulator called a spinal nerve stimulation. these nerve stimulators can cause pain in the backside of the spine. if the pain is severe you may need to seek immediate medical attention. you can also try a spinal fusion device (spf) to relieve the pain. this can be helpful if you have a spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spinal cord) or if you are experiencing pain in a joint. you may also be experiencing pain from a nerve injury
Expected Response: it is important to differentiate between sore muscles from the workout and a possible injury. you typically feel sore muscles about a day later and the feeling can last for 2 to 3 days. you can treat it with rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin ibuprofen or naproxen. if there is pain associated with the sciatica you should consult your physician to make sure there isn't a more intense injury that needs to be treated.

Answer: hi if your find this is the first time you have had this it could be a sign of an allergy but you can get it from your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear your husband is going through this. he sounds like a hardworking man. he needs to have these symptoms evaluated by a medical professional. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. they could be related to his truck driving (nerve irritation in the back) but they could also signal an underlying condition that needs to be treated. i wish i could offer you a good explanation but these types of symptoms truly must be evaluated by physical examination and tests. i wish you and your husband all the best!

Question: my daughter takes citalopram hydrobromide tab 20 mg and seroquel tab 100 mg. which is for indicated for sleeplessness?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's impossible to tell you how many medications you're taking at one time without knowing the specific reason. i'm not a pharmacist so i can't comment on the specific medications you are taking. however i can tell you that the medications you take together are safe and effective for you. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: both medications are depression medications and have side effects for drowsiness. seroquel tends to cause more drowsiness but both have the side effect. when used adjunctively the side effect tendency increases. neither of these medications will be prescribed for sleep aid alone. you should consult your daughter’s doctor for a better understanding as to why these medications were prescribed and use your pharmacist for a better understanding of how these medications work in the body.

Question: warts on hands tried home remedies o/c med derm. burned off removed by surgeon and imiquimod. back and spreading mor. this is my 19 yr old son and we have been fighting these for 3+ years now. they are spreading rapidly and we have no clue where else to turn. we have tried all the home remedies we can find including duct tape super glue apple cider vinegar and on and on. the surgeon had to put 5 stitches on the palm of his hand when he removed one and it's back and larger. is there an oral medicine he could possibly try? he now has about 18 on one hand. is this normal?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're able to get this treatment. i'd suggest you talk to your surgeon about using a home remedy that will not cause you any harm. there are many things you can do to prevent skin cancer. i wish you all the best! i wish i
Expected Response: there are no oral medicines that are routinely used to treat common warts although some people have tried the cimetidine (tagomet) but this is certainly an off-label use with mixed results. personally i have never used it. my suggestion would be for him to see a good dermatologist. someone who can work with him closely trying different high-end treatments until a cure is orchestrated. he has definitely tried lots of things but i have never met a wart that i couldn't (eventually) kill with persistent treatments. i use liquid nitrogen most of the time but there are more topical (prescription) treatments that can be used if the dermatologist feels it is appropriate.

Expected Response: yes. it is safe to use tylenol with buspar and ritalin. there are no significant interactions between the medications.

Question: hi is gallbladder cancer a common disease? also is it possible to have it detected early enough to be cured? . my mother had a few episodes of vomiting over the last few weeks and also lost about 30 pounds during the last two years without really trying to do so. she had bloodwork done last week and had an ultrasound performed this tuesday. she received a call from her primary care physician yesterday (wednesday) asking her to come in so her doctor can review the results with her. i'm obviously nervous since the results were provided to her physician so quickly. is this normal turn around time?
Answer: gallbladders are very difficult to treat. i have been told that gallblades can be treated with antibiotics. but i do not know if you are aware that you have gallbladia or not. it is possible that you are having gallbladenia (the inability to urinate) and that you need to see your primary care provider to get a diagnosis
Expected Response: based on the description i am not sure why you are assuming gallbladder cancer since it is quite rare. maybe the doctor indicated that was a concern. ultrasound results are available quickly so i wouldn't let that part worry you. however unintentional weight loss is a concern and i'm glad that her doctor is getting to the bottom of what's going on. to answer your specific question gallbladder cancer is not common and fewer than 10 000 people are diagnosed with it every year (including cancers of the gallbladder bile ducts). it is usually found fairly late because it's often advanced by the time someone has significant syptoms. if it's found early which happens in about 1 in 5 people there is the possibility to cure it. but even if it can't be cured treatment can definitely help prolong life.

Question: what can i do about head lice?
Answer: head louse is a viral infection that can be caused by many different viruses. it is not contagious but can be transmitted by contact with infected people. the most common viral infections are herpes simplex (hsv-1) and chlamydia (hcv-2). head louses can also be spread by direct contact with someone who has head litis. it may be difficult to determine the source of your head lue infection because the virus can be spread through direct contact.
Expected Response: head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system. just the mention of head lice will make you scratch (i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now). head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood. yes head lice are vampires — they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases. lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department. lice lay dozens of eggs (nits); eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species. as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now! now you can scratch your head. it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy. school systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. schools must have a team of nit nazis. insects are taking over our world. actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world. dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. termites are eating our homes. flies are landing on our dinner plate. ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. kids — even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes — can get head lice. i know. my long-haired daughter brought some home many years ago. girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. i often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well. i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. “your daughter has head lice. ” “what! are you sure? could it be something else? ” “no. she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp-crickets also known as the common cootie. you probably have them too. ” like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like nix) malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested stromectal — a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive. there is a lice-smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta people don’t know you are killing innocent lice. my late grandmother mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist used kerosene. once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring the next job is to manually remove the nits. there are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft but in the end adults end up just picking them out one at a time. there may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. lice do not respect social status so anyone can get them. if your kids bring them home from school then you will need to go to def con 4. the recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. vacuum the carpets and mattresses but again lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. it is not necessary to burn down the house and move.

Question: why do i yawn after 30-40 minutes of exercising?
Answer: yawning is a common symptom of muscle weakness. it's a sign of fatigue. if you yawning during exercise you may feel a stiff neck and a sore throat. if your yawning isn't severe you may experience a headache. if it's severe you can feel a muscle strain. if yawning causes you to feel a sore chest or chest pain it's likely that you have a heart attack.
Expected Response: it doesn’t seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because you’re fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isn’t one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance. iron deficiency

Question: plz answer correctly. i don't think you understood the question. i was drinking orange juice it seemed to go the wrong way and i hacked a little but did not cough. one hour after drinking i felt a little tickly so i coughed once intentionally. any danger?
Answer: i think you're correct. orange juice is a great way to get rid of a cold. it's not as good as cough syrup or even plain cold water. if you're having a cold you need to use a cool compress to keep it from getting worse. you can also use a vaporizer to help relieve the cold. you also want to avoid taking any medications that contain caffeine. i suggest you call your doctor or health care provider for a hands-on evaluation. you may also want a visit to a pharmacist to get your prescription checked out.
Expected Response: most helpful answer had you aspirated a sufficient amount of orange juice or any liquid for that matter into your lungs i can assure you that you would have immediately coughed and coughed extensively as your body clears your airway. you have two lungs -- three separate lobes on the right and two lobes on the left so even if you did accidentally aspirate a tiny amount it would be harmless. and would not result in a situation that one would call drowning.

Question: should i be worried if my baby weighs more than usual for his getstational age? . should i be worried if my baby weighs more than usual for his getstational age? . i am 17 and a half weeks pregnant and had my level 2 ultrasound done. i was told my son weighs 9 oz. is that big for his gestational age?
Answer: it is not a big difference. the body is growing faster than the baby. the baby is growing at a slower rate than the body. the adult body is not growing at all.
Expected Response: ultrasounds help health professionals estimate weight but it is impossible to be precise with weight until the baby is born. your healthcare provider will measure baby's growth in a variety of ways to make sure everything is on track and should alert you if it is not. for example they will measure the size of the head and the length of the bones on ultrasounds monitor your weight and size. it is best to address growth concerns with your doctor who is following your case closely. see this article for more details of growth during the second trimester of pregnancy. congrats on your pregnancy!

Question: what is acute fulminant hepatitis?
Answer: acute hepatitis is a viral infection caused by a virus that causes acute hepatitis. it is usually caused by an infection caused with an infected person. acute hepatitis usually is caused by the hepatitis b virus. it may also be caused by other viruses or by other forms of viral infection.
Expected Response: rarely individuals with acute infections with hepatitis a and hepatitis b develop severe inflammation and the liver fails (acute fulminant hepatitis). these patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis and the additional problems of confusion or coma (due to the liver's failure to detoxify chemicals) and bruising or bleeding (due to a lack of blood clotting factors). in fact up to 80% of people with acute fulminant hepatitis can die within days to weeks; therefore it is fortunate that acute fulminant hepatitis is rare. for example less than 0. 5% of adults with acute infection with hepatitis b will develop acute fulminant hepatitis.

Question: me and my daughter just might have ate bad meat what could happen? . i am a vegetarian and i don't eat meat. i am not a big fan of meat but i do eat it. i do not eat meat at all. i have no problem with eating meat but it is not a good idea. i don’t think i should eat meat but my daughter does.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm not sure what you mean by "bad meat" but you can certainly eat meat if you want to. it sounds like you're eating a good deal of meat. if you're not eating meat at the same time as your daughter you probably need to eat more of it. you might want to consider adding some dried fruit or vegetables to your diet. you can also try some fruit and veggie substitutes such as applesauce or mangoes. you'll want to make sure you're getting enough fiber in your diet as well.
Expected Response: well you will know soon enough if the meat you ate was spoiled or otherwise "bad. " usually food poisoning starts with diarrhea but may also include nausea vomiting and abdominal cramps. the onset of symptoms depends on which bacterium is causing the food poisoning. there are more than a dozen organisms that can cause food poisoning. e. coli is a common cause of food poisoning from meat. symptoms from e. coli usually begin 3 to 4 days after exposure to the organism. many cases of food poisoning go away on their own. it's important not to take any anti-diarrhea medications if you begin having food poisoning-related diarrhea as this is the body's way of getting rid of the toxin. however diarrhea can be very dehydrating so it's important to drink plenty of water during this time. if your daughter is very young and begins to exhibit the signs of food poisoning such as diarrhea that is accompanied by severe abdominal pain or doesn't stop after 24 hours i'd suggest you seek immediate medical treatment. the same is true if either of you experiences numbness or tingling of the hands face or feet or if you experience confusion. i hope the meat was fine and neither of you suffers any ill effect! you will soon know

Question: im 14 i could produce sperm but now it woun't come out im scarred could it get answered quickly please im 14 yrs old btw. what happening to me?
Answer: hi if you have a problem with your sperm then you need to get help from your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: without the ability to examine you and take an extensive medical history it would be impossible for me or any medical provider to blindly offer you a patient-specific explanation. my immediate advice to you is to lay off masturbation for about 3-4 days and then see what happens. frequent ejaculations can decrease seminal volume significantly so give it rest for a few days. i suspect things will return to normal.

Question: do i have to take antibiotics for gastroenteritis or is it possible for us to get better without antibiotics?

Question: i have a hard lump in my left nostril on the wall between nostrils. should i be concerned? . it's not painful but it hurts when i breathe. it's hard to breathe. i've had it for about a week now. i have a sore throat and a sore tongue. should this be treated?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very scary! it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure in your nasal passages. it could be a problem with a sinus infection. it may be a sign of something else. if you have a sinuses infection you may need to see a health care provider for an evaluation. it can be hard to tell when you're feeling pressure in the nasal passages but it's important to make sure your sinuses are well-protected. the best way to help prevent pressure in this area is to wear a mask. if your sinusitis isn't getting better soon you may want to see
Expected Response: mmm probably not. if this gets bothersome in terms of pain or bleeding or blocking sinus drainage then i'd definitely recommend you get it checked out by a physician. if it persists for more than a few weeks you may also want to get it checked out. it's rare to get cancer in that area though not unheard of but i'd consider that a longshot. more likely it's a cyst or something similar to a zit. as always if you find this lump worrisome make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider and have it looked at. take care!

Expected Response: i think you are talking about prostatitis -- a prostate infection/inflammation that can have many causes. the treatment depends on the presumed cause and the severity of your condition so it would not be wise to self-treat this problem. see a urologist so you can be properly examined expertly diagnosed and treated based on those findings.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're dealing with this. it's hard to say how bad things are going without a little bit of context. there's a lot of misinformation out there about what to do about your husband's adhd. it sounds like he's going through some kind of "rebound" from
Expected Response: there is really little that can be done over the internet other than to offer you some advice. i don't know your husband's complete medical history or have any way to medically evaluate his memory issues but he does have some obvious contributory factors: tobacco marijuana use poor nutrition (a guess) insomnia due to unknown factors and perhaps many many other issues. he will need to see a medical professional to start the evaluation process assuming you will be able to convince him to do so. encouraging him to give up tobacco and marijuana may be futile but at least you can try and work on him.

Question: what are the maximum out-of-pocket limits associated with the new aca?
Answer: the maximum number of out-pocket costs that can be incurred by an individual with a chronic disease is $69 000 per year. this is the maximum amount that can result in a health care provider's health care costs.
Expected Response: in 2014 the maximum a single individual will pay out-of-pocket in 2014 will generally be $6 350 while a family could pay up to $12 700. these include deductibles and any co-pays or co-insurance payments. this is true for most consumers including those whose plans are purchased in the exchanges but people covered by employer plans with pharmacy benefits administered by a different company than the primary insurer may face higher costs for drugs in 2014. this difference goes away in 2015.

Question: began with extreme itching and some redness between last two toes and around toes. used otc cream to treat athletes ft. itching increased and now blisters are appearing. how to treat?
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. it is not unusual for itching to occur on the feet. it may be due to the use of a topical antibiotic cream. it could also be due the fact that you are using a lot of otc otc creams. i would suggest you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

Question: can you get pregnant from anal sex even though you are still a virgin? . i am a virgin and i am not a virgin. i have never had a problem with anal sex. i am only 18 years old and i had sex with my boyfriend at the age of 14. i was not sexually active at that time. i did not have any problems with anal intercourse. i would not be able to have sex with someone else unless i was physically present. i do not have a problem getting pregnant. i don't have any other problems.

Answer: hi if you do have a problem with your abs then you may need to see your doctor for a test. good luck

Answer: hi if you are taking penicillins you could have a cold and you would need to take it with cold medicine then yes you can take it. but if you have allergies then you need to get a good cold medicine. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: if your medical provider has prescribed penicillin for a bacterial infection then yes. if you are self-prescribing penicillin for your "cold" then be advised that colds are viruses and penicillin does not work for viruses. when you have high blood pressure certain cold medications should not be taken so please consult your medical provider or pharmacist for advise -- someone who knows the exact medications you are taking or plan on taking. i do not have this information nor do i know your medical history.

Question: are there disadvantages to drinking fruits and vegetables from a blender instead of eating them as they are? . if i ate all the fruits and veggies i should it would take a lot of time every day to wash them cut off/out the inedible parts and chew them. i must sound desperately lazy but i'd love to save time by washing and trimming 4-5 days' worth of produce at once throwing it all in a blender and drinking it over the next four days. would i digest produce less thoroughly if i drank it instead of chewing and salivating? would the puree lose any nutrients sitting in the fridge for a few days? thanks!
Answer: you should not have to eat all the produce that you eat. it is a waste of time.
Expected Response: whether you chew them up. or a blender chews them up and you drink them does not make any difference. you are getting the same level of nutrients.

Answer: colds are caused by viruses. viruses are caused when colds cause a virus to invade the body. colds can be caused by a variety of viruses. cold viruses can be spread by direct contact with the body's own immune system. cold virus infections can be transmitted by direct exposure to cold viruses. you can get cold viruses from people who have been exposed to colds (or from people with colds). cold viruses are usually spread by cold viruses that are spread by contact with a cold virus. cold sores are caused from a cold sore. cold sore sores can be painful and can be difficult to treat. cold herpes can
Expected Response: this is one of the most persistent myths about colds. the only way to catch a cold is by being exposed to a cold virus. cold air may irritate an existing condition such as asthma which would weaken your immunity. this could make your body more receptive to a cold virus but only if you come in contact with it.

Question: i have a really bad oder coming from my vagina even after i washed it. i have a very bad oda coming from the vagina even when i wash it. the only thing i can think of is a uti. i don't know if this is a vaginal infection or if i have an std.
Answer: hi if you have a utis you could get a urinary tract infection (uti) from your sex partner but if you are not having sex then you should be ok. good luck

Question: when i get upset i feel nauseous i can't beathe and my stomach hurts i get really depressed. should i talk to a doctor? . i was just wondering if i should see a doctor. when i get upset i feel overwhelmed. i can't breathe my stomach starts to hurt and i feel nauseous. i feel alone and really depressed. i can't do anything i use to enjoy with the same enjoyment. this can last for a couple days. it's something that occurs quite often. i was just wondering if i should see a doctor or if this is okay.
Answer: hi if your having any problems with your stomach then you should see your doctor or go to your doctor and get a test done there its a test that will tell you if you have a problem with your body or not. good luck
Expected Response: no this is not ok. yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist. depression is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it. the same is true of anxiety which might be what you're experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe. you are not alone in your feelings. many people experience the same things which i hope brings you comfort. a doctor can help you figure out what's going on and suggest treatment for you. you deserve to live a happy full fulfilled life. you're worth it. personally i do not believe in taking antidepressants without "talk therapy" (also called cognitive therapy). i think you might benefit from a combination of both and i encourage you to seek this help. i wish you all the best!

Answer: hi if you were to take a test and it was positive you would be ok. but do get a test done and get a blood test done. good luck

Question: what can i do to help with arthritis in my feet on the bottom of my feet and they hurt badly?
Answer: there are several different types of arthritis that can cause pain on the feet. some people have arthritis that is caused by the arthritis that has developed on the toe. others have arthritis caused by an infection that has spread to the foot. the symptoms of arthritis vary from person to person and sometimes it's not clear what causes it. some arthritis is caused primarily by an inflammation of the joint that is causing the pain. arthritis is more common in people who have arthritis than in people without arthritis. if you have arthritis on the toes you may have arthritis. the arthritis can be caused by many things including: arthritis caused in the joints. arthritis caused from the arthritis. arthritis that causes pain or stiffness in the feet or feet. arthritis in the hands. arthritis of the hands or feet caused by arthritis. a person's ability to walk. arthritis or arthritis in other parts of the body.
Expected Response: it may not be arthritis at all. if it is on the bottom of your feet it could be plantar fascitis. see a podiatrist for a proper examination and treatment which could be as simple as getting different shoes to special orthotics (shoe inserts). arthritis can also be improved by using nsaids (a class of drugs that includes ibuprofen and naproxyn).

Question: i am taking the bupropion xl generic does it work the same as wellbutrin xl?
Answer: bupropions are a combination of two medications that are used to treat certain conditions. the first is bupropiodine which is a combination medication that is used to prevent certain types of heart disease. the second is buvranil which is an antihistamine that is a medication that helps prevent heart disease in certain people. the combination medication is used for a number of different reasons. for example it can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. it can also help prevent certain kinds of heart problems such as heart disease and stroke. it is also used to help treat certain other conditions such as diabetes and certain cancers.
Expected Response: most helpful answer generic medications contain the same active ingredient(s) as their brand-name counterparts. they may contain different binders and inactive ingredients. in the u. s. generic drugs are regulated by the food and drug administration (fda) and are required to meet the same quality standards as brand name drugs. research has shown that generic drugs work just as well as brand name drugs. that said there are always slight variations in purity and strength between batches of mass-produced medications. this is true of all drugs that are mass produced both name brand and generic. the fda regulates how much variation is allowed and it's not very much. if you have recently switched from a brand-name medication to a generic version and feel it isn't working as effectively you should talk to your health care provider about it. he or she can help you determine the best course of treatment. best wishes to you!

Question: could a vaginal longitudinal septum affect me getting pregnant? . in december i was diagnosed with a vaginal longitudinal septum (no extra or split organs just the septum) that would require surgery. my boyfriend and i have been trying to conceive for almost 10 months after farther research i found that couples can be considered infertile after trying to conceive for 12 months with no success i was wondering could this septum be the reason we have had so many troubles getting pregnant?
Answer: hi yes it can be the same thing but the way your looking at it its a bit of a mystery as to why you were diagnosed with it. but if you have a period and you miss it then you could have a miscarriage. so if you miss a period then you need to get it checked out and get it tested out. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi reading through this link should help you understand what your problems are and how they can be overcome. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. couples have tried far longer than 12 months and still get pregnant mostly its all down to timing and being relax and stop trying then it will happen. do hope this is of help to you. good luck

Question: i'm 7 days late for period and got a faint second line on pregnancy test this morning. i'm i pregnant or not? . have been trying for months to get pregnant. i am now 7 days late for my expected period and having pretty bad stomach and abdominal cramping. i have noticed constipation last couple weeks as well as muscle cramping in my legs. headaches come and go much more frequently and are worse with stress. i took a first response pregnancy test this morning and got a very faint second line. i don't want to get my hopes up what do i do now? am i pregnant?
Answer: hi if your not pregnant then you may be pregnant then just wait a few days then go see your doctor or a doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: i have no way of blindly determining if you are pregnant over the internet so i would suggest that you repeat the pregnancy test in a week to see if the results are more definitive or call your medical provider to order a more-sensitive blood pregnancy test. don't be too anxious. if you are pregnant you will be pregnant for quite a while. if you are not pregnant you should know in a few more weeks when the tests fail to show evidence of a pregnancy.

Question: can fillers replace plastic surgery?
Answer: plastic surgery is a surgical procedure that involves removing the skin and replacing it with new tissue. plastic surgery may be performed on a person's face and body.
Expected Response: fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn “i-was-strapped-to-a-747? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery can’t take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they don’t answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as i’ve said many a time one shoe does not fit all.

Question: what causes ringworm of the scalp or beard?
Answer: ringworm is a fungal infection that is spread by the fungal skin fungus called ringworm. it is caused by a fungus called the funcogen. the fungus causes the skin to itch. the skin of the body is covered with a protective layer of skin called the skin's protective layer. the protective layer protects the skin from infection by the fungus. the fungi can live in the skin for up to 10 years and can spread to the hair follicles and the scalp. ringworm can be caused by any of the following: sun exposure. sun exposure is the most common cause of ringworm in the united states. sunscreens such as sunblock and sunblock creams contain ingredients that are known to cause ringworm: retinol retinyl palmitate retinyl propionate and retinyl salicylic acid. retinoids are used to treat ringworm but they are not as effective as the retinyl
Expected Response: ringworm infection is caused by a fungus. fungi that cause ringworm live and multiply on the upper layer of the skin and on the hair. ringworm is not caused by a worm or other parasite. the medical term for fungal infections is tinea followed by a word that describes the location of infection. for example tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp and tinea barbae is ringworm of the beard. ringworm of the scalp is most commonly caused by the fungus trichophyton tonsurans which is spread from one person to another. this fungus causes more than 90 out of 100 cases of ringworm of the scalp in north and central america. 1 in the past the fungus microsporum canis was the most common cause but it is a less frequent cause now. microsporum canis is spread by cats and dogs. ringworm of the beard is caused by trichophyton verrucosum and is spread by cattle and other farm animals. you can catch ringworm by sharing contaminated hats combs brushes towels telephones clothing sports equipment or even theater seats and by direct contact with an infected person. children are more susceptible to the fungus and more likely to develop an infection than adults. adults often do not develop an infection even after exposure to ringworm-causing fungi. adults and less commonly children can be carriers for ringworm. carriers can pass ringworm on to others but do not have symptoms of the disease. ringworm-causing fungi can live on people objects (such as hats or brushes) or animals for several months. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: lately i seem to be overly moist during sexual intercourse. i don't like it. i am not sure if i should go to the er or not. i have been having some dryness and it is not like i am getting wet from the inside. i also have a tendency to get a little dry in my vagina. i feel like i need to use a condom but i don’t. i just want to know if i can get rid of it.
Answer: hi your find the answer to this is this. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: there may be no logical reason for this occurrence. it just happens and should not be considered a problem. lubrication during sex is a very complex event but typically the greater the excitation the greater the lubrication. you and your partner must be doing something right. there is really nothing medically that can be done to change the amount of lubrication your body decides to emit.

Question: if you have a cold can you take zyrtec in the am and nyquil at night.
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know anything about you or your medical history. i would not be able to give you a specific answer based on your brief posting. i suggest you call your health care provider for a referral to a specialist.
Expected Response: you can do that if you tolerate both medications well. try to do without medication as much as possible especially toward the end of the cold because sometimes the backlash reaction from coming off antihistamines (like zyrtec) can make it seem like your cold is lasting longer than it should because it can make your nose stuffy when you are coming off it.

Question: im 19 my penis is under 5inch when erect. is this normal? help i'm scared to have sexual intercourse. i'm 19. i have a penis size of about 5. 5 inches. i've been trying to get pregnant for about a year now. i feel like i'm going to have to have sex again. i want to know if this is normal. i am scared to be intimate with someone who is 5'6" or taller. i don't know what to do.
Answer: hi your find it is not normal to have erectile dysfunction. it may be a side effect of having a bad sex life. but it can be a sign of something else. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance. and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal. i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size. society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of "masculinity " after all. i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size. but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist. he or she can examine you and tell you if everything's ok. also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isn't measured based on the erect organ. rather penis size is measured by "stretched penis length. " the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor. i hope this helps set your mind at ease! don't worry about it. the average penis in america is 6 inches. i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine. she says it is just right and doesn't hurt her. you are probably going by the magazines and movies. trust me they are not normal sized. we are created individually and when you find mrs. right she won't care. there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length. they do work. it is a slow process but it can be done. also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate. again its a slow process but it is possible. there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on. also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself. if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you. if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly.

Question: my 7 yr old son found a roundworm in his dirt pile & now i am freaking out. does he need to be tested for roundworms? . my 7 yr old son thought he found an earthworm in his dirt pile but as soon as i seen it i knew it wasnt a earthworm. i believe it is a roundworm & now i am freaking out b/c he plays in his dirt pile every single day. i know that he has gotten some of this in his mouth b/c him & a friend were throwing dirt at each other & some was thrown in his mouth. does he need to be checked for worms?
Answer: you should not be throwing dirt in your child's dirt pile. he needs to be properly examined by a medical professional.
Expected Response: not all round worms are human intestinal roundworms. i am not sure what he found but the roundworms that you are concerned about live inside his colon not in a dirt pile. you can certainly have him checked if you want (stool specimen) but if he is not having any intestinal symptoms of worms he may not have anything

Question: having sex with two different guys a day apart and on my menstrual. i do know that the two guys are clean and so am i but iam worried since i didnt use protection and since ive heard that you can get so many diseases when you have your menstrual and you have sex. if i can please get some answers iam really worried. if i can end up getting a diease or even having the ability of getting pregnant.
Answer: hi ok so your find that you have a problem with your periods and you are having unprotected sex with one of them its not just one of the two. but you could have both of them but you need to get tested for both of these. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?

Question: what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?
Answer: if you have osteoarthritis or its associated symptoms you can do a variety of things to prevent it. you can: reduce your smoking. reduce your alcohol intake. limit your use of prescription pain relievers such as ibuprofen and naproxen. reduce the amount of alcohol you consume. reduce smoking. stop smoking. if you are overweight or obese you can reduce your risk of osteoarrhythmia (inflammation of the cartilage in the knee) by consuming fewer calories. you may also reduce your exercise intensity. exercise more slowly. if your doctor or health care provider recommends a low-impact exercise program you can choose to do it at home. if the exercise program doesn't work for you you can try a low intensity program at home or at a gym.
Expected Response: here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. 1: control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. 2: exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. 3: avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. 4: eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega-3 fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.

Question: will testosterone injections reduce sperm count?

Question: what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?
Answer: pregnancy planning is a process that involves the mother and her baby. it is important that you know what you are planning for your baby and what you can expect in your pregnancy. if you do not plan for your child to be born before you know you have your baby then it is very important that your plan for the baby is right for you. if your plan is right you can get pregnant. if it is wrong you can have a baby. pregnancy planning can be difficult because you are trying to conceive. if the plan is wrong and you are not sure if you are pregnant or not then it may be time to make an appointment with your gynecologist. you can call your gynecomastia or gynecological provider to discuss your pregnancy plan.
Expected Response: having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving (see medical issues below). women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.

Question: what are psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs?
Answer: psoriasis is a condition that can be caused by many conditions including arthritis. psoriasis is a common skin condition that is often seen in children and adults. psoriasis is a skin condition called psoriatitis. psorsa is a disease that affects the skin of the body. it is caused by a combination of bacteria and viruses. psoresa can affect the skin and the skin can become infected. psoreasis can also be caused from other conditions such as: a yeast infection. psomnias are a group of skin disorders that affect the lining of the skin. psomatic psomniacs are people who have a genetic disorder that causes a condition called the "liver psoritis" or "livers psorosis. " psomnomic psommycans are people with psoratitis who have inherited a condition known as the "viral psoratic
Expected Response: in most patients the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. the arthritis frequently involves the knees ankles and joints in the feet. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a "sausage. " joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called "mutilans" can cause rapid damage to the joints. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis. aside from arthritis and spondylitis psoriatic arthritis can cause inflammation in other organs such as the eyes lungs and aorta. inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (iris) causes iritis a painful condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. corticosteroids injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent blindness. inflammation in and around the lungs (pleuritis) causes chest pain especially with deep breathing as well as shortness of breath. inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valve valves leading to heart failure and shortness of breath. acne and nail changes are commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. interestingly these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. acne has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. in fact a new syndrome has been described characterized by inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) acne and pustules on the feet or palms thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis) and bone inflammation (osteitis). this syndrome is therefore given the eponym sapho syndrome.

Question: if you do sex every alternate day on the week of your ovulation will you be pregnant with a boy? . hi. my doc told me to try to every alternate day after 12 days from 1st date your period started. . i am want to get pregnant with a boy and i know if you have sex on the day of ovulation your chances of having a boy increases coz there is a chance the y chrome will get attached to the egg. as i dont know the exact day of my ovulation and if i have sex every other day from day 12 is there a chance i get pregnant with a boy? . thanks.
Answer: hi just google natural ways out of pregnancy and fertility your find lots of info on how to do this google natural methods out of fertility and fertility you find lots more info on natural ways to do that just google this link <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: that is silly advice but you do have a 50/50 chance of having a boy (or girl) no matter when you have sex. every day or every other day. chromosomes are inside the sperm and egg. the "y" doesn't really attach to anything. the fastest sperm is often the one that impregnates you so if you want a boy all you can do is hope that the sperm swims like michael phelps. there are many old wive's tales about techniques to improve your chances of having a boy or girl but in the end those techniques are no better than a coin toss. if you get what you want you will praise the method you used. if you don't you will not recommend it to anyone. so let nature make the decision for you and don't stress out about the sex of a baby that has not been conceived yet. just hope for a happy healthy baby.

Question: outside of hormone therapy what other measures can be taken for painful intercourse after menopause? . penetration hurts if girth of penis more than 1 and a 1/2 inches thick. if g-spot is more than 2 inches from the opening of the penis it is painful.
Answer: hi as you have been doing a lot of research and reading about the side effects of menoprolol you should be able to find out why this is. as you know the main side effect of menopausal hormones is a decrease in the production of testosterone. so if you are having sex after menopausal hormone therapy then you will need to see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: this is a vexing problem for post-menopausal women. i'm sorry you're going through it. while hormone therapy (often estrogen cream delivered directly to the vaginal tissue) is usually recommended to help with the dryness and atrophy (shrinking) of the vagina after menopause other options are available. assuming you're not allergic to any of the ingredients you could try an over-the-counter vaginal moisturizer such as replens brand. this is not the same thing as lubricant used during sex. a vaginal moisturizer works to keep delicate vaginal tissues moist and supple. at least that's the theory. i don't know about the science behind it but it probably can't hurt. there are several brands of vaginal moisturizers on the market. an old-fashioned method to maintain vaginal tissue health is the boric acid suppository. ask your gynecologist about this. you can have boric acid suppositories prepared at a compounding pharmacy. they work to help moisturize and maintain the ph of vaginal tissue. most important don't give up. keep talking to your gynecologist about the problem because new products and strategies for dealing with vaginal dryness are constantly being developed. wishing you well!

Question: my daughter takes an antibiotic for impetigo and eye drops for allergies. can she take something to reduce her fever?
Answer: yes. it is best to talk to your doctor about the best way to treat your allergy. it may be better to take a cold or flu vaccine.
Expected Response: before making any recommendations i would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using. . it is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any over-the-counter fever reducers. so it is likely to be fine. i would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughter's fever based on her age weight and the other medications she's taking.

Answer: hi if you have a fever you should get it checked out by your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: this is a great question and i'm so glad you asked. many people associate gastrointestinal upset (nausea diarrhea) with the flu (influenza) but actually the true flu doesn't usually produce any of these symptoms. sometimes people refer to the "stomach flu " which is actually a condition called "gastroenteritis. " the nausea and diarrhea you're experiencing likely are caused by something other than influenza a. have you by chance taken antibiotics recently? if so that class of medications can cause gastrointestinal upset. this condition usually gets better after you finish the course of antibiotics. you also should consider eating yogurt or taking a probiotic to help with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. be sure to drink plenty of water whenever you have diarrhea -- and wash your hands thoroughly in case you're carrying a bug that can be passed to others. if the diarrhea doesn't clear up within 14 days or so another trip to the doctor is in order to try to figure out what's causing the problem. wishing you well!

Expected Response: you need to see your doctor right away if you are having trouble swallowing your food. there can be many possible causes for trouble swallowing. some can be very serious. here are a few of the things that can cause difficulty swallowing: • the esophagus (the tube that runs from your mouth to your stomach) may be partially blocked by a tumor or web. it may also be narrow due to severe reflux. • a swelling in a surrounding area such as the thyroid or lymph node may be pressing in on the esophagus. • there could be a problem with the nerves or muscles that are involved in swallowing • poor teeth can be preventing food from being properly chewed • diseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may prevent the esophagus from moving the food along webmd has a very good article on difficulty swallowing that can give you some more information. but do call your doctor now and make an appointment to have this checked out.

Question: i am confused because my dr says to stay on a low protein diet because my ammonia level is 151. . however my total protein test is low at 5. 6 won't this effect my total protein result? .
Answer: hi the first thing you need to do is see your doctor or a dietitian to find out what your problem is. but if your getting a high protein diet then you need a good test done there the test is called a hpt test. if your hpt is high then you should get a test done at your doctor. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: usually when ammonia is high there is trouble with the liver since it is the organ that breaks down protein to ammonia. it is no longer standard practice to subscribe very low protein diets with liver disease (i'm not sure how much your doctor is recommending). the key is to eat the right amount of protein -- not too much but not too little. the total protein measures the amount of protein in the blood which could be affected by your diet. i recommend seeing a registered dietitian who can explain to you the amount of protein you need and how it relates to all of your blood levels. read more: total serum protein ammonia blood test

Question: i'm breastfeeding and didn't realize peptobismol wasn't safe. i only took 1 dose how long should i avoid breastfeeding? . i got norovirus and the stomach pain has been awful so i took one dose of peptobismol without realizing it wasn't safe for breastfeeding. i just researched it and all sites basically say to avoid it due to the risk of reye's syndrome and other risks to the baby. how long should i avoid breastfeeding?
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know the reason for your breastfeeding. you need to be careful about what you eat. i would suggest you go see your doctor to see if there is anything you can do to avoid breast feeding. you can find out more about breast feeding at www. breastfed. org.
Expected Response: breast feed your baby. the chance of you or your baby getting reye syndrome or having any consequences after one dose. for the tiny amount of salicylates (aspirin) in the pepto bismol. would be highly highly unlikely. what is more important is that you stay well-hydrated and nourished until the virus has abated. if this is not possible you can temporarily switch the baby to supplemental formulas or any stored breast milk until you are up to the mission again. get better. you baby will be fine if you resume breast-feeding.

Question: how long before i can i return to sports like the one that injured my finger in the first place? . my middle and ring fingers got caught in the elastic waste band of my opponents shorts as i pulled their flag. both fingers injured but i felt a "pop" in my middle finger. i squeezed the middle finger from the top and bottom and felt something move and the discomfort decreased a great deal but on day 3 after injury and wearing a splint i no longer have range of motion whereas i did have full motion on the day of injury. i have no other symptoms.
Answer: you are correct that you cannot return to a sport like football. if you are not injured you will need to see a medical professional to determine the cause of your symptoms. if the injury is severe you will not be able to return to the sport.
Expected Response: most helpful answer a release to "return to sports" will need come from your medical provider -- the one that examined you for your injury. healing time is so very individual that it would be impossible to blindly determine when you can play sports again since i cannot examine your fingers to see if they are healed. as much as i would like to help you with your question this is not something that can be done over the internet.

Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's hard to say what you're experiencing without a physical examination and a physical exam. if you're feeling this way it's important you get this checked out. it could be a stroke or even a heart attack. there are many causes of stroke and stroke is one of them. if your symptoms are consistent with a stroke it's time to seek medical attention. you can get a blood test done to determine if you have a stroke. if so you can have it done. if not you can talk to your doctor.
Expected Response: if you have symptoms of a stroke it's important to seek immediate medical attention. one-sided weakness can be a sign of stroke. here are other common symptoms: sudden vision changes sudden problems walking sudden severe headache sudden inability to speak most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case. if your one-sided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor. i can't think of any reason why anxiety would cause one-sided weakness. i suppose it's possible it could be a medication side-effect but this still deserves to be checked out. i suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible. best wishes to you!

Question: healthcare reform. i make too little to qualify at marketplace and too much to qualify for medicaid. what now? . on unemployment since dec. so how do i not qualify for medicaid? they are including my roommate's income who has nothing to do with covering my medical expenses. why do they use household income when not a related family member. i have medical conditions and am desperate to have coverage. can not afford to pay my cobra premium of 500 per mo. beginning april 1.
Answer: you can find a good source of information on medicaid through the american health insurance exchange. you can also search medicaid's state pages on medicare. gov to find the best state to find a state that offers medicaid coverage.
Expected Response: unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs like florida are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. but you may be misinformed about what you are and are not eligible for. your roommate's income for example doesn't count toward your household income simply because you share a home. you would need to file taxes together in order for your incomes to impact one another for health insurance subsidies. open enrollment is now closed for the year but if you recently lost your job and health insurance you may qualify for a special enrollment period. if you do you might be eligible for private insurance at highly subsidized rates. i suggest you go to healthcare. gov and perhaps pick up the phone to speak with someone to make sure you've explored all of your options.

Question: is a cortisone injection merely a pain reliever or temporary remedy?
Answer: cortisones are not a cure for any of the common colds. however they can be helpful in treating a variety of conditions including asthma and other respiratory infections. cortisoprodilators are used to treat the common sore throat and cough. they are also used to relieve pain from a sore throat or cough. corticosteroids are used in the treatment of other conditions such as arthritis and certain cancers. cortizone injections are not recommended for the treatment or prevention of arthritis.
Expected Response: corticosteroids are not pain relievers. they reduce inflammation. when corticosteroids relieve pain it is because they have reduced inflammation. while the inflammation for which corticosteroids are given can recur corticosteroid injections can provide months to years of relief when used properly. these injections also can cure diseases (permanently resolve them) when the problem is tissue inflammation localized to a small area such as bursitis and tendonitis.

Question: my granddaughter has to have a gluton free diet what can i feed her? . she has stomach pain alot and she has a cousin (her aunts child) that is allergic to gluten so they want to put her my granddaughter on a gluten free diet to see if this helps her. i need to know what i can and cant feed her and what i can substitute so she still gets nutrients she needs. with out it costing me an arm and a leg im on a rather small income but want to do whats best for her.
Answer: hi your find that you can feed your child gluten free but it would be best to see your doctor asap good luck
Expected Response: gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products. people on a gluten-free diet often avoid wheat rye and barley; though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well. a gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meat/poultry/fish and many dairy products. unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy. if not buying fresh food it’s important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as gluten-free. for example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging. the food industry can use gluten in many products that don't seem like they would contain gluten so it's important to always read the label first. having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well. it may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have. the basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods. the person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet. review this webmd article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes. well she has celiacs disease (non life threatning disease) but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like ( some chex mix cerals corn tortillas some soups any thing that says gluten free on the label

Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. i know it sounds scary but it is important to understand that insulin is not the only medication that can help control your weight loss. many medications can be helpful in controlling your weight. it is not unusual for someone to have a problem with their weight loss but it may be hard to tell without a physical exam. it may also be a sign that you are not getting enough insulin. i suggest you see a registered dietitian to help you determine if you need to take more insulin. the best thing you can do is to get a blood sugar test done. this will help you
Expected Response: no. caffiene is not important at all. humans like it but they don't really need it.

Question: i've been on medication since 2000 for my multiple sclerosis. this year in april i fell into the doughnut hole. . my medicine cost went up extraordinarily high from $27. 50 last year to $55 in january $144 in april and each month it was starting to go go higher. it came to the point i was no longer going to be able to afford my medication so i called around and found some help with my medicine through the chronic disease fund. why after all of these years is this happening to me?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's hard to tell exactly what's going on without a hands-on look at your medical history. i hope you feel better soon! if you're concerned about your health and your ability to pay for your medications you might consider visiting the health care provider who specializes in chronic diseases. you may want to consider a referral to a health care professional who specializes specifically in chronic disease management. you can find
Expected Response: when you enter the part d prescription-drug "doughnut hole " you pay a higher percentage of your drug costs. the doughnut hole starts once you and your plan have paid a total of $2 970 toward your medication costs. this year you do receive a discount of 52. 5% on covered brand-name drugs and 21% off generics until you've reached the end of the coverage gap ($4 750). that's when catastrophic coverage kicks in. you might want to also look into medicare extra help which helps pay drug costs for people with low incomes.

Question: what's the best skin lightening cream; i am darker skinned?
Answer: there are many skin lighteners available. the most common are: aloe vera gel (selenium) and aloe gel (cyan) which are both used to brighten the skin. aloe is also used to moisturize the skin as a result of the sun's rays. alo gel is also a good moisturizer. al o is an ingredient in many skin creams. alprazolam is a common skin lightener. al prazolamide is a moisturizer that is a combination of aloe and alprazein. al paprazol is a skin lightenant that is also available as a moisturizing cream. al penicillin is an active ingredient in aloe. alpenicillin can help to brightens the skin and brighten wrinkles. alpheniramine is a product that is used to help to lighten the appearance of the
Expected Response: to brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with. typically that's something called inflammation. that inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin didn't like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan. even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin that's more blotchy or uneven. if you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma. so we use brightening creams to help lighten this. the gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called hydroquinone and this i prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product that's used and how long it's used for. hydroquinones can also be combined with over-the-counter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like niacinamide. and green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin. that's the word i don't like using. these are brighteners and not bleaches.

Question: how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. . thank you.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm not sure what you mean by "stress test" but if you're taking simvirastatin you should be fine. the heart disease that you're describing sounds like a "stress fracture". the heart is the body's primary source of oxygen. it's important to note that simvadine is not a cure for heart disease. it can be helpful in some
Expected Response: i went through all the test in the hospital. i was told i had a heart of a 27 year old. my doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure. they went in and found a blockage--widow maker. they did a stent. surgeon stated i would have been dead within 30 days. so much for test. you can try red yeast rice and naicin. naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor. i take both and my readings are 90/72. try it capsules do not cost very much.

Question: i've had white noise (with corresponding hearing loss) in my left ear for 2 months. what causes it and can it be fixed. i have had an mri -- negative for tumor ms or anything else that might be causing it. i'm wondering if i should have a home test done to find out if it's a tumor or not.
Answer: hi i think you should see your doctor and get a test done there is a link to the link <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: hearing loss would generally be caused by a problem with the ear or a problem with transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. it sounds like you have had tests to detect any brain or nerve problem. i would have to assume at this point you have also seen an ent (ear nose and throat) doctor to have your ear thoroughly examined. sometimes it can be tough to identify the cause of ringing in the ears or white noise-type sounds like you describe with associated hearing loss. the only recommendation i can offer at this point is to work closely with an ent doctor to keep searching for what might be causing it as the list of possibilities is lengthy. based on your symptoms i am not able to tell what might be going on. i am sure you have done quite a bit of research on your own at this point but a search on "hearing loss" on webmd will bring up a host of useful information. to get started here's information on the most common causes of hearing loss. did any doctor call it "tinnitus? " if that's what it is here are some reasons why you might have it that i found. not sure though that this is helpful if you do not have tinnitus. "the most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging (presbycusis) but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises (acoustic trauma). tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. other possible causes of tinnitus include: a buildup of earwax. medicines especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. ear infections or eardrum rupture. dental or other problems affecting the mouth such as temporomandibular (tm) problems. injuries such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. a rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position such as when bicycle riding. blood flow (vascular) problems such as carotid atherosclerosis av malformations and high blood pressure (hypertension). nerve problems (neurologic disorders) such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. other diseases. these may include: acoustic neuroma. anemia. labyrinthitis. meniere's disease. otosclerosis. thyroid disease. most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. you may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms does not get better or go away or is in only one ear. there may not be a cure for tinnitus but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. i also found this article on home treatments: <link>

Question: me and my boyfriend had sex early friday morning on my 18th cycle day. will there be a chance i will become pregnant?
Answer: hi your find that if you have sex with someone who is not pregnant then you will have a period but not a period. but if you are having unprotected sex then you may not be pregnant. but you may get pregnant if you do not get pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: here is a link to a slideshow about fertility and ovulation that i think you'll find very helpful. it states: "while the exact timing of ovulation can vary on average it happens between day 11 and 21 of your cycle. a brain hormone called luteinizing hormone (lh) surges triggering the release of the egg that's most ripe. at the same time your cervical mucus changes to a slippery egg-white consistency to help sperm make their way to the egg. " so there is a chance that you could be pregnant if your ovulation cycle fits this pattern. the webmd answers staff

Question: will running help me lose weight? . i am running a 4 mile run. i have been running for about 4 weeks now. i am not overweight. i exercise a lot. i do not have any other health issues. i want to lose weight. i'm running a 5 mile run which is about 4 hours long. i don't want to get sick or anything. i just want to be healthy. i would like to be able to lose as much weight as i can without running.
Answer: i would suggest you see a registered dietitian or nutritionist. they can help you find the right way to lose excess weight.
Expected Response: running certainly does burn lots of calories and if you're running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if you're putting all that energy into running. but even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldn't lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned. the bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do. running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. however i would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging. start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session. you can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging. eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking. from there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging. a couch to 5k program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging. it’s important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury. if you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight. the extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise.

Question: what are the treatments for ulcerative colitis?
Answer: the most common treatment for ulcers is chemotherapy. chemotherapy is a combination of chemotherapy drugs and other treatments. the most effective treatment for a common ulcer is chemotherapy-like drugs such as metronidazole (mephedrone) and clomid (cidofovir). chemotherapy is also used to treat other conditions such as cancer. the treatment of ulceratives is similar to that of cancer. chemotherapy drugs are used to prevent ulceration. the main treatment for an ulcer may be chemotherapy. it is not known whether chemotherapy is used to reduce the risk of ulcers. chemotherapy may also be used to control other conditions that may cause ulcerations such as: heart disease diabetes or cancer.
Expected Response: both medications and surgery have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. however surgery is reserved for those with severe inflammation and life-threatening complications. there is no medication that can cure ulcerative colitis. patients with ulcerative colitis will typically experience periods of relapse (worsening of inflammation) followed by periods of remission (resolution of inflammation) lasting months to years. during relapses symptoms of abdominal pain diarrhea and rectal bleeding worsen. during remissions these symptoms subside. remissions usually occur because of treatment with medications or surgery but occasionally they occur spontaneously that is without any treatment.

Question: why is it important to know that pregnancy complications put me at future risk for heart disease?

Expected Response: ”these complications are an opportunity to detect early that there is a problem ” says [american heart association 2011] guideline chair lori mosca md phd. mosca is director of preventive cardiology at new york-presbyterian hospital and a professor of medicine at columbia university medical center in new york city. you can then follow up with your primary-care doctor to evaluate your overall cardiac risk and quickly start appropriate prevention strategies. “if you developed gestational diabetes follow up and say ‘what can i do to prevent heart disease and diabetes? ’” she says. your doctor may recommend weight loss aggressive lifestyle changes and possibly medication she says. “we are unmasking a problem early so that we can prevent full-blown cardiovascular disease. ”

Question: if i have oral herpes can the girl get it if we have vaginal sex dont kiss or have oral sex but dont use a condom? . i have been having oral herpes for a few months now and i have not had a period since. i have had a few bumps and some soreness on my hands and feet but it is not the same. i do not have any other symptoms.
Answer: hi yes it can happen but it would be best if you get a test done to see if you can get it from there. good luck
Expected Response: i think what you're asking is: can you transmit genital herpes to your partner if you have oral herpes but you do not perform oral sex on her. and the answer to that is "no. " you also can't give her oral herpes if you don't kiss her. herpes is transmitted by direct contact. i applaud your concern about not transmitting herpes to your partner. however what concerns me more here is the issue of safe sex in general. how do you know she doesn't have genital herpes that may be transmitted to you? she could have genital herpes and not even know it. or she could be infected with humanpapillomavirus (hpv) and not know it. in fact she could have several sexually transmitted diseases and be unaware of it. why would you take chances with your reproductive health by not practicing safe sex at all times? plus of course there's the issue of pregnancy. do you want to become a father? are you ready to become a dad? because it's possible if you're having unprotected sex. no method of birth control is 100% effective but you can increase the effectiveness of any birth control by using "redundant systems" (to borrow a term from computer science). in other words even if your partner is using some form of birth control you can also use a form of birth control (in this case a condom ) to make sex even safer in terms of pregnancy prevention. again i think you're very wise to be aware that you have oral herpes and to be concerned about not transmitting this virus. i hope you think about the other issues i brought up too.

Question: std incubation period. i was with my usual partners within one week of coming into contact with a person that i believe has an std. what is the incubation period before i am able to pass along the std? could i have infected my usual partner?
Answer: the incubated period is the time when the virus is most likely to be present. if you have a partner that is not currently infected with std you will need to be tested for std before you can pass it on.
Expected Response: there are many stds. and each one has their own "incubation period". needless to say if you had unprotected sex with someone who has an std you are at risk. find out what kind of std. or better yet get tested for all of them. use a condom next time and you won't need to worry.

Question: how do i prevent baby bottle tooth decay?
Answer: most helpful answer baby bottle teeth are not toxic. baby bottle dentures are made of a special polymer called a polyurethane. this polymer is made of calcium carbonate and is the most effective way to prevent tooth decay. it is also the most durable. if you have a child who has a dental problem it is important to see your dentist as soon as possible. you can also try using a toothbrush to help prevent tooth loss.
Expected Response: the good news is that a few simple steps can help stave off baby bottle tooth decay. they include implementing good oral hygiene at an early age. here's how: wipe the baby's gums with a clean gauze pad or washcloth after each feeding. begin brushing your child's teeth without toothpaste when his or her first tooth comes in. clean and massage gums in areas without teeth. floss once all the baby teeth have come in. make sure your child is getting enough fluoride which helps reduce cavities. if your local water supply does not contain fluoride ask your dentist or doctor how your child should get it. schedule regular dental visits by your child's first birthday. dentists also offer special sealant coatings which can help prevent tooth decay in children. these are expensive however. other techniques to help prevent baby bottle tooth decay include: not filling bottles with sugar water and soft drinks. bottles are for milk water formula and special electrolyte-containing solutions when the child has diarrhea. juices mixed half and half with water to avoid empty calories are a way to interest your child in a "sippy cup. " soft drinks are not recommended for children as they have no nutritional value. never allowing your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing anything but water. never giving your child a pacifier dipped in anything sweet. decreasing your child's sugar intake especially between meals. it's never too late to break bad habits. if your child drinks sweetened liquids from the bottle and/or sleeps with a bottle break the habit now and reduce the risk of baby bottle tooth decay by: gradually diluting the bottle contents with water over two to three weeks. once that period is over fill the bottle with water. remember that healthy baby teeth will lead to healthy permanent teeth.

Question: i take 40 mg pravastatin doctor wants it at 80mg. i can't afford new meds can i take 2 40mg tabs instead of the 80mg?
Answer: yes you can take pravestatin at 80 mg or higher.
Expected Response: well technically yes you can take two 40mg pills instead of one 80mg pill but that just means you'll run out of medication faster. i suggest you consult your pharmacist to find out exactly what the cost difference is between the 40mg pills and the 80mg pills. you may find there's very little price difference at all. also i suggest you discuss the cost factor with your doctor. there may be an alternative medication he or she can prescribe that is less expensive. health care providers tend to be very sensitive to cost issues on the part of their patients so don't hesitate to bring this up with your doctor. wishing you all the best.

Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'm glad you're having a good time. it's a good thing you're able to get a good circumcision done. it can be a difficult thing to do. it may take a few months for the foreskin to completely heal. the foreskin can be hard to remove and it can get very painful. the best thing you can do is to get it properly examined by a medical professional. if it's not properly examined you can have a urinary tract infection or a urinary infection. i hope you feel better soon
Expected Response: yes this can be surgically fixed. you would need to see a urologist. this would most likely be a simple office procedure to remove this extra skin if you find it to be a cosmetic issue.

Question: can a patient request a double appointment with their pcp if they need more time to ask questions without paying extra? . senior citizen patients specifically? . we have been asking them for more information about what their pcd is and how much time they have to wait before they can get a second opinion.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're asking for more time. it's important to note that the pcp is not a "second opinion" -- it's a medical provider's office. it is not an emergency room. it does not have a waiting period. in fact it is a waiting list. if you have questions about the pcd or your medical history you can call the pc's office at 1-800-633-4227. we'll be happy to help you.
Expected Response: in my opinion yes. you can request more time. the medical provider has a way of up-coding the visit so they get paid a bit more by medicare or insurance companies. as a paying consumer (regardless of who actually pays) the doctor really works for you. your paid consultant so to speak. i really feel that they should spend extra time especially if requested by the patient. not all medical maladies can be evaluated and cured in ten minutes (or less)! if your medical provider is not agreeable perhaps it is time to shop for someone who will be compassionate enough to spend the time necessary to meet your needs.

Question: do cruciferous vegetables have anti-inflammatory benefits?
Answer: the benefits of cruciferously vegetables are not known. they are not considered to be harmful to the body.
Expected Response: the cruciferous vegetables — broccoli brussels sprouts bok choy kale cabbage and cauliflower — are “super veggies ” loaded with protective and powerful plant compounds such as sulforaphane. a new study from ucla linked sulforaphane with anti-inflammatory action in the body. sulforaphane stimulates an increase in production of antioxidant enzymes in the nasal airway which work to protect against tissue-damaging free radicals that we breathe in from pollution pollen tobacco etc. when we decrease tissue damage we are decreasing inflammation in the body. this is probably just the beginning of what this phytochemical does for us because sulforaphane appears to increase a whole assortment of antioxidant enzymes in the body — all potentially helping to protect the body. sulforaphane is just one reason to eat your cruciferous vegetables. recent research suggests that the components in these veggies are probably working together. research from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign suggests that one of the phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables crambene is more active when combined with another better-known phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables indole 3-carbinol.

Expected Response: ice chips. popsicles. juice boxes with those tiny straws. staying hydrated is not optional so offer only a tiny sip or about an ounce at a time will certainly add up if you do it often. food is optional for a few days but fluid intake is not. you have to encourage them to drink. my giving ibuprofen you can lower the pain threshold a bit.

Question: what could be wrong with my liver? . i went for an ultrasound earlier this week as i have been having symptoms that have progressed for two months (loss of appetite vomiting diarrhea (sometimes bloody) fatigue abdominal pain and cramping). they found two black spots on my liver and are sending me for more testing (an mri). i heard it could be fatty liver disease; but that usually occurs with the obese and people who drink a lot. . im a 16 year old female. 118 pound; 5'5. i live a very healthy lifestyle (exercising and dieting) and have been on the pill for over a year. i am taking the pill regularly and am not overweight. i have a good appetite and i have no issues with nausea. i do not smoke or drink alcohol.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best! i'd suggest you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: at 16 years of age or at any age waiting for a diagnosis related to liver symptoms is upsetting and scary. liver disorders can strike at any age and even in people who live a clean and healthy life. your doctor should have explained the possible causes of your symptoms as they relate to the black spots. it is not possible to determine the causes of your liver spots until further testing is completed but the possible significance of the spots could have been discussed. with that said please do not listen to well-meaning individuals suggesting a fatty liver as your problem. for the record most people have some degree of fatty liver. here are my two suspicions regarding your case: inflammation responses; non-cancerous and cancerous tumors (please note that it is unusual to have cancer originating in the liver. known as primary liver cancer). i recommend that you receive more information from your doctor surround yourself with the best and most open medical professionals have as many radiologic tests done as possible help to keep the diagnostic testing moving as swiftly as possible to reduce large gaps of time when you are just waiting and thinking talk about your feelings to family and friends and maintain a positive spirit. i wish you well during this period of medical uncertainty.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're feeling better. i'd suggest you get a referral to a coloscopy specialist to get a definitive answer. you might want to consult with your primary care provider to
Expected Response: if going to an er is not a financial issue i am sure that you can get care for your pilonidal cyst. there is no way to know if there is a colorectal surgeon waiting around to take care of you however but many er physicians and other primary care medical providers can handle this sort of thing. as you probably know pilonidal cysts do become infected from time to time so perhaps you should consider a more definitive surgical procedure and have the entire cyst removed? no more problems after that surgery!

Question: what cut of steak is good for entertaining?
Answer: steak is a great food to eat but it is not a good source of calories. if you are a vegetarian you can eat steak with meat but you will need to eat more.
Expected Response: have you ever stood before the meat department and wondered what to do? eye of round london broil new york flank filet mignon … they all stand before you and it can be overwhelming. my cousin celia called me today. she was having that “what to do with the meat? ” dilemma. she was getting ready for a friend’s birthday party (this friend loves a great steak) but wasn’t sure which cut to pick for the crowd. if you’re having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon it can be a costly endeavor. my favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is london broil. it is not a fatty cut. the thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so it’s not chewy. when you are starting make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature — do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. if your meat is too cold when you start cooking it it will end up being dried out and chewy. i recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and don’t cook the steak too long (i recommend medium rare to medium at the most). you can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. i also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds slice it thin. this way you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. you still get your boost of protein and iron — and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! you can rub a london broil piece down with cracked pepper kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sautéed garlic. you can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. anyway you prepare it have fun with it and remember to keep your portion size in mind. a good visual for portion size is the size of your fist.

Answer: hi if its your stomach it would be best to get a test done to see if its normal. good luck
Expected Response: viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year. please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since i have no way of examining you. the most important thing is fluid replacement. you must stay well-hydrated. don't eat very much for a few more days. most of these viral infections resolve in about 7-10 days so hang in there. at least you are not vomiting so be greatful. in my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas. your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined.

Expected Response: there is no specific home treatment for gallstones but be sure to call your doctor if: you think you have symptoms that may be caused by gallstones. if your doctor finds that you do have gallstones but your symptoms are mild it is generally safe to wait until you have more than one attack before you consider having surgery. you develop symptoms of a gallstone attack again especially if they are severe or occur with fever chills or yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes. you have new belly pain or other belly symptoms. pain in the belly can be a symptom of many health problems. you may be able to help prevent gallstones if: you stay close to a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. you avoid rapid weight loss. intentional weight loss (dieting as opposed to weight loss from illness) followed by weight gain may increase your risk of gallstones especially if you are a woman. if you need to lose weight do so slowly and sensibly. if you have recently had surgery to remove your gallbladder : watch for signs of infection. call your doctor if the area around the incision is red and puffy or if you have a fever. call your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) light-colored stools and dark urine. these symptoms may be signs that gallstones are blocking the common bile duct. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what conditions does lactose intolerance treat?
Answer: lactose intolerant people may have lactose-containing foods (such as yogurt) that are not lactose free. if you are lactose sensitive you may be able to tolerate a lactose supplement but if you have a gluten intolerance you may not be able. lactose tolerance is not a cure for celiac disease.
Expected Response: this product is an enzyme supplement used to help people who have trouble digesting milk and other dairy products (lactose intolerance). lactose is a type of sugar found in milk products. lactase enzyme is normally produced by the body to help break down (digest) lactose. lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces low amounts of lactase enzyme. lactose intolerance can begin at different ages. infants are not usually affected but lactose intolerance can affect children as young as 2. it is very common in adults. one way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid milk products. however this can result in a lack of important nutrients and vitamins such as calcium vitamin d riboflavin and protein. some people use lactose-free milk or milk substitutes such as soy or rice milk. most people with low lactase enzyme levels can tolerate small amounts of milk products at one time (2-4 ounces) and get symptoms only with larger servings (6 ounces or more). taking lactase enzyme with milk products as directed can help prevent upset stomach abdominal bloating/cramping gas and diarrhea caused by these products. the fda has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness. consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.

Question: is hand foot mouth disease the same as thrush. is hand foot and mouth disease caused by the same virus as thrush? would l-lysine help this condition? .
Answer: hi if you have l-lyl it is a virus that can cause hand foot foot and throat disease. l- lyl is a type of fungus that causes a sore throat. it is not caused by l- virus but by the fungus that lives in the mouth. l l- is a fungal infection that causes sore throat and throat. if you are a person with l- it is very important that you get your hands checked for l- herpes. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: no. they are not the same. hand foot and mouth disease is caused by a coxsackie virus. thrush is caused by yeast. l-lysine would be worthless in treating either one. hand foot and mouth disease will self-resolve and does not require treatment. thrush may also self-resolve but there are prescription anti-yeast medications that really help make it go away sooner.

Question: what would make my tsh levels suddenly jump to critically high level when i feel the same? . i take synthroid 1. 25 daily and yet my tsh is now 28. 3 increased from 23. on friday. why would it jump so quickly? my dr. is on vacation and i just want to make sure this is ok to wait until thursday when he comes back. . thanks
Answer: hi if your tsh was just a little higher then you could have had a heart attack or stroke you could be suffering from a heart problem. good luck
Expected Response: i'm wondering why you would have your tsh tested twice so close together. usually with hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) it takes weeks of medication therapy to see any change in tsh levels so it doesn't make sense to me your doctor would have you tested just a few days apart. that said while a tsh value of 28 is high it should be fine to wait until thursday to see your doctor. as to why your tsh seems to be going up without you experiencing symptoms well many things can cause this. your doctor will be able to give you some possible reasons for this and (hopefully) get you on a path to better control. best wishes to you! staying at the wrong dosage amount for too long and fluctuate your levels and cause them to change and go from under to over.

Question: does drinking too much water and soda before a meal make you feel full that you do not want to eat? . my sons girlfriend allows her children to drink a lot of water and soda right before they eat and then they do not eat. doesn't drinking a lot before a meal fill you up and then you are not hungry?
Answer: i would suggest that you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. it is not uncommon for children to have problems with their drinking and eating habits. i would also suggest that your pediatrician see you to discuss this issue with you.
Expected Response: yes drinking fluids especially sugar-sweetened or calorie-containing beverages can cause feelings of fullness resulting in decreased food intake. young children with small stomachs are more likely to fill up than older children and adults. it's best to serve calorie-containing beverages with meals. for example juice and milk with lunch or dinner and soda only occasionally. water is the best in between meal beverage. good luck!

Question: can you use beast milk on a diaper rash. she has a bad rash all over. is it safe to use beast cream on a rash?
Answer: no. it is not safe to put a diaper product on a child with a rash. the best thing you can do is use a product that is designed for use with the rash.
Expected Response: interestingly yes you can use breast milk for diaper rash. although i'm not aware of any studies that prove it works many women claim it does. it certainly can't hurt to try. my concern is when you say the rash is "all over. " i hope you mean "all over" the baby's bottom. if your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment. with diaper rash prevention is better than treatment. remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments. it's very important that you thoroughly clean and dry your baby's genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change. and never leave your baby "soaking" in wet diapers. change the diapers regularly. instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isn't having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes. wishing you and your baby well!

Question: how is the hepatitis b virus spread (transmitted)?
Answer: the hepatitis c virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva. it is also spread through sexual contact.
Expected Response: hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.

Question: can a yeast infection cause pain in the urethra as well as the head of the penis? . originially thought to have prostatitis a month ago have been experiencing penis soreness urethra pain some redness. gonnohrea and chlamydia negative and 3 weeks of cipro provided no relief. now thinking it may be fungal. could this be a yeast infection and if not what could it be?
Answer: hi there's no way to blindly guess at your answer but you should see your doctor and get tested. good luck
Expected Response: yes it could be fungal. depending of what direction you have more confidence in get candida treatment like fluconazole and if you are circumsized use the creams like canesten. if you are not circumsized i would not recommend the creams as they shrink the foreskin and you will feel like a little boy again. ( but then the foreskin cracks and that really is painfull and impossible to keep clean) if you go for the more natural approach gentle soaking and washing with a mild sollution of nice quality applecider- vinegar will work like a miracle cure.

Question: can a severe anxiety/ panic attack affect your speech for a short period of time. when i talk my speech is off. . i had to major anxiety / panic attacks that affected my speech. however it was for a short period. but every since then when ever i get very upset or hear bad news my speech become mild to severe impared. my doctor gave me the name of this but i forgot. however my family noticed that the anxiety is becoming more severe and it is becoming harder to relate information to me that might upset me. i try not to let thing get to me but i just can't control it. it makes me very moody. home is me and my family is me.
Answer: i would not be able to give you a definitive answer based solely on your description. i would suggest that you seek medical attention and have this checked out by a health care provider.
Expected Response: i suffer with anxiety and i find that anxiety may affect your speech because of fear that you may not say the right thing.

Question: if alka-seltzer helps me does that mean i'm not having a heart attack? . i am a 28 year old woman i don't drink or smoke. for that past three days i have been having pain in my chest and a warm feeling behind my chest and have been having gas also. it only stopped after i took some alka-seltzer and only worked for a few hours. i also have a history of panic attacks and heartburn.
Answer: alka seltzer does not work for heartburn and gas. it is not recommended for use in children under age 2. if you have a heart condition like heart disease or diabetes you should not take alka in the first place.
Expected Response: it sounds like you are having symptoms of gerd (or acid reflux disease) with your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is highly unlikely you are having a heart attack. if you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into gerd. i have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with gerd. i find taking an extra strength zantac (150 mg) once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms. if that doesn't help or doesn't help enough you can always speak to your doctor. there are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better. (proton inhibitors slow the production of stomach acid) however if you are having any other symptoms or your current ones get worse i would definitely contact your doctor right away.

Question: how can we treat our 6 month old who has nasal congestion that only seems to bother him at night?
Answer: there are several things that can cause nasal congestion. some are caused by the bacteria that live in the nasal passages. some of these bacteria are called "fungal" bacteria. some may be caused by a virus or bacteria that can live in your nasal passages (for example a strain of the common cold). some are related to a virus. some can be caused from a viral infection. some cause from a bacterial infection. most of the time a child will have a mild nasal congestion (sometimes called "sickness") that doesn't bother him or her. it is not unusual for a child to have a cough that doesn’t bother him. it’s also not unusual to have nasal congestion in a toddler who has a cough. you can treat this by giving him a cough suppressant (such as a cough syrup) or by using a nasal spray.
Expected Response: my favorite is using nasal saline drops (with or without the suctioning). the saline helps to loosen up the mucus and promote drainage and the saline also helps to shrink down the nasal passageways -- allowing for more air passage. since it is just salt water you can use it as often as you like and it is pretty inexpensive. .

Question: my dad had his bladder removed due to cancer. has a urostomy. now after 4 years he has blood from his penis and pain. he is not sexually active nor masturbates". no trauma or injury. just pain and a slow oozing of bright red blood. no other symptoms or changes with his urostomy. he does have a large abdominal hernia from the bladder removal surgery done in 2008. cancer?
Answer: hi you have to ask your doctor what is the problem with you and what should he do? good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear your dad is going through this. it sounds frightening. i would not jump to an immediate diagnosis of cancer. while this unexpected bleeding certainly should be investigated by a health care professional there could be many causes for this bleeding that have nothing to do with cancer. that said i would suggest your dad see a health care provider as soon as possible. any time a person develops a new symptom (such as bleeding) it's worth getting it checked out. hope this helps. wishing your dad all the best!

Question: i will retire this year at 62. my income will drop from $60 000 a year to $22 000. my current employer offers a health insurance plan similar to the silver plan for $150/month. can i save money by opting out of the employer plan and opting into the aca plan? what are my options? also is there a maximum out-of-pocket amount for the aca plans?
Answer: yes. if you choose to retire at 62 you will need to take a health plan that is similar to what you currently have. if your income is lower than what you are currently earning you will likely qualify for medicaid.
Expected Response: while you're still working you won't qualify for a tax credit if the employer's plan is considered affordable under the law. affordable employer health insurance costs no more than 9. 5% of your income and covers at least 60% of covered medical costs. health plans must now limit your annual out-of-pocket costs to $6 350 for an individual and $12 700 for a family. once you retire and are no longer an active employee you can buy a plan through the marketplace. depending on your income you may qualify for a tax credit to buy insurance through the marketplace.

Question: i quit smoking 11 days ago. i smoked 10-12 a day. will the continine show up in my blood test when i go for it?

Expected Response: normal since you were a light smoker. it takes approx. 2 weeks for it not to show up in blood work. i would say your safe for it not showing up.

Answer: hi ok so you have a lump in your breast and its not a lump but a lump that looks like a lump on your breast it is called a breast lump. the lump is called an ovarian cyst. it is very hard to see. the cyst is a thick layer of tissue that grows from the inside of the breast. it's called a cy
Expected Response: i can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump. you will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies. many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindly. you must have a proper examination.

Question: is it safe to take benadryl and aleve together?
Answer: i would not recommend taking benadrine or aleve if you are taking them together.
Expected Response: benadryl is a nonprescription medication that is often used for allergies and aleve is a nonprescription pain reliever. one of the most common side effects of benadryl is drowsiness. depending on the quantity taken aleve may also cause some drowsiness. but there are no interactions between these two medications and they are completely safe to take together.

Question: postpartum depression? maybe? . hi there. i had my child 18 months ago and we live in a different state with no family or friends--husband works alot. i am always so unmotivated. and sad. i would never think or have feelings about hurting myself or others but i just want to get out of this groove. i love my kids and feel no way as if i can not take care of them i miss family and do not hang out with many people these days and also dont exersize i eat fine not too much not to little. can you please let me know any suggestions!?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're having a good time. it's not uncommon for a child to have a hard time dealing with the "other" side of things. you may be experiencing some of these symptoms: a lack of motivation or a lack in self-esteem. a lack or lack of self-confidence.
Expected Response: post partum depression like other forms of major depression may last for months or even years if untreated. it is not your fault. eighteen months is too long to have endured those feelings of sadness. certainly with a husband working long hours and not being in an area with close friends and family can also contribute to depression. only a mental health professional trained in depressive disorders can properly diagnosis whether you are experiencing ppd some other form of depression or a combination of these maladies. you may also have a medical condition that results in causing depression as a symptom. i respectively make the following suggestions: 1. ) talk with your husband about your sadness. if he is not approachable then seek the counsel of your physician (this individual can conduct medical testing as well as assess your overall mental state prescribe medication and make mental health referrals) or a minister / priest /rabbi. they can act as a sounding board to express your feelings and offer positive suggestions on restoring joy in your life. 2. ) consider joining a self-help group to support your efforts at regaining purpose in your life. you deserve to feel worthy to have friendships and to feel and give love. through talk therapy and medications the prognosis is encouraging.

Answer: hi its from www. cayenne-fda. com its the only place you can find info about the drug and how to lose weight. if you have any questions ask this answer. good luck
Expected Response: the key is to get the cause of the weight loss under control which it sounds like have started to do. as for weight gain you need to make food and eating a priority. frequent meals (5-<positive_smiley> may work better especially if you still having nausea. take advantage of the times your appetite is high which for most people with nausea is in the first half of the day. provide yourself with as many food groups as possible when you do eat-- grains protein dairy (or alternative) healthy fats and fruits and vegetables. so instead of just cereal in the morning top it with nuts and fruit and also have a boiled egg. at snack time have full fat yogurt with nuts and graham crackers. make sure you up the fat where you can such as adding a fat source to sandwiches like sliced avocado mayonnaise nut butters or hummus. add full fat dairy products to smoothies and soups and butter or nut butters to toast. protein sources are beneficial such as meats tuna (packed in oil) and beans. with time and vigilance you can get your weight back up. for more tips on healthy ways to gain weight see this webmd article. good luck!

Question: i had a dtap in 2011 and i stepped on a nail today. do i need to get a tetanus shot? . im 16 years old. i had a tetra shot in 2011. i stepped onto a nail yesterday and it was a dtap. do you need to have a tet shot?
Answer: i don't know what type of tetanus vaccine you are taking but i would recommend that you see your primary health care provider for an examination. tetanus is caused by a virus that can live in the blood and cause symptoms similar to a cold sore. tetra vaccines are available to all ages and are given to people ages 12 through 19 years of age. tetranes are given for the prevention of tetroditis.
Expected Response: the good news is: probably not. the dtap vaccine (which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis) is considered protective for 10 years. we recommend everyone get re-vaccinated with dtap every decade. that said the only way to tell for sure you're protected (because not all vaccines "take" the way they're supposed to) is to look at your blood antibodies. if your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then you're golden. bottom line: your best bet is to consult a health care provider. even if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems. better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary. hope this helps!

Answer: the best thing you can do is get a prescription for it. it's a lot cheaper than you think. i suggest you get a home clinic to get it started. they can help you get started.
Expected Response: if i were you i'd probably break open a vitamin e capsule rub it on my lips before bed and let it soak in overnight. that does amazing things for healing. sometimes medicated lip balms can be a real problem especially if your lips are already irritated. but vitamin e oil does wonders for delicate skin like that.

Question: how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?
Answer: there are a few things that are important to remember about pap smearing: the use of a pap smear is not the same as using a diflucan or other diflamethicone-based product. difluorocin is a steroid that is used to treat acne. the use and use of diflorocin-based products is not a good idea because it can increase the risk of cancer. the only way to prevent cancer is to use a diluted diflatable device that you use for the first time. a dildo can be used to insert a dildosilicone-type device in your vagina. you can use a condom or a d-ring to prevent vaginal penetration. there are no effective dildomizers that will help prevent vaginal or anal penetration. the dildolizer is a dilation device that can be inserted into the vagina to relieve pain
Expected Response: the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear.

Question: my doctor asks me to get a tetanus vaccine upon an injury when i am doubtful of acquiring tetanus. . is this anti-tetanus vaccine? if so for how long do these vaccines are effective? some say it for three months or for six months. is it okay if one gets this vaccine before twenty-four hours of injury?
Answer: yes. tetanus is a virus that is transmitted through direct contact with the body's own immune system. the body can't fight the virus and so the vaccine is not effective. tetanitis is not a viral disease but rather a condition that can occur with any of the following: tetanus (commonly referred to as tetanus diphtheria) is a viral infection that can cause severe pain and swelling. it is also a viral illness that can be caused by the immune system (such as from an infected person). tetanus can also be caused from a direct contact (such a direct exposure to a person's body's
Expected Response: the tetanus vaccine is good for ten years but some medical providers will recommend a booster vaccine sooner than that if there is some doubt as to the previous date or if the wound is particularly prone. the disease tetanus is very rare in the united states (not so rare in other countries) but if you should get it it has an extremely high fatality rate. getting a vaccine every ten years for 100% protection is really the best deal out there in the vaccine world. getting the vaccine 24 hours before a planned injury (? ) is unlikely to be very effective unless of course you have prior immunity from a previous tetanus still on board.

Question: what treatment options are there for fracture of the spine due to osteoporosis besides morphine patches?
Answer: there are no treatment options for fractures of the vertebrae in the spine. however there are some medications that can be used to treat fractures of this nature. in addition to morphine patches there are other medications that may be used for the treatment of osteoporsosis. these include corticosteroids such as nsaids or cialis. corticostomy drugs (such as cializumab) are used to relieve pain and swelling of the spinal cord. cortisone injections are used for pain and inflammation of the nerves and other tissues in the spinal canal. cortizone injections can be done by either a spinal tube (tubes) or by a needle. in general there is no treatment for fractures in the vertebral arteries. however the following medications may be helpful in treating osteopontosis: corticotrophin injections (such like cial
Expected Response: a fracture of the spine whether from osteoporosis trauma or cancer is basically a broken bone. the usual treatment for a broken bone is to stabilize it. a broken vertebral body can be stabilized either by a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure such as a vertebroplasty kyphoplasty or by open surgical procedures. an older technique now rarely used is to remove or sever the nerves supplying the bone; these nerves are called the gray rami communicans. finally various medications for pain can be used. these would include the full range of pain medications including over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen aspirin and the various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and various prescription medications including hydrocodone morphine preparations and the fentanyl patch.

Question: we are having some weight gain and growth issues with our 17 month old. my daughter stella is 17 months old. she is only 18 lbs and not growing well. she is in the "less than 2nd %" on both height and weight. we have been to several doctors and have had several tests done and luckily everything has come back fine. stella loves to eat! she can eat a kids meal and 10 minutes later be asking for a snack. with all the food she eats she should be an obese baby. she is doing great developmentally. anyone with some advice on other tests please let me know.
Answer: hi i think it would be best for you to see a doctor for a proper examination. good luck
Expected Response: the key for growth at this age is looking at her growth over time. has her growth been steady since birth but at lower percentiles or has it dropped recently? red flags for growth are when they cross 2 percentile lines either up or down. also doctors should be using the world health organization growth charts for children under 2. if you pediatrician is using the cdc ones it could give you daughter a lower reading. lastly i highly recommend seeing a pediatric dietitian. he/she can assess what/when/how your child is eating and provide recommendations. typical reasons for groth issues include difficulty transitioning to solid food excessive juice/milk stressful feeding and a low fat/low calorie diet. children under 2 need more fat so that is an important consideration when deciding what foods to offer. also timing and feeding interactions can make a big difference in how well a child eats. you can get a referral through your doctor to a outpatient program at a children's hospital or find a dietitian that specializes in pediatrics by visiting eatright. org. once you get some answers you can rest easy knowing you are doing all you can do.

Question: what are the complications of orthostatic hypotension?
Answer: orthostasis is a condition in which the body's supply of fluid to the brain is reduced. orthostatitis is caused by a protein called thalassemia. the thalassa is the thickening of the blood vessels in the brain. in orthostatism the fluid in the blood is thinner than in normal people. the blood vessel walls are thinner than normal. the fluid is thinner in the legs and hips than in people with normal blood pressure. the thickened blood vessels help to fill in the fluid. the thicker fluid helps to drain the fluid out of the brain and into the blood supply. the thinner fluid helps the blood to clot. the clotting fluid helps clot in the body. the thinened blood vessel helps to fill the blood with fluid. it also helps to prevent clotting. the thickness of the thilassemia in the bloodstream is called the blood pressure (bpi). blood pressure
Expected Response: falling is the most important complication of orthostatic hypotension. most often the symptoms are transient and self-limiting giving the patient a chance to sit down but when the drop in blood pressure causes syncope (fainting) or near syncope it is the trauma that is sustained in the fall that causes the most damage.

Answer: you will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

Question: itchy labia folds but not itchy vaginal opening. per my obgyn not std bacterial or yeast infection. what else? . i have really itchy labia folds especially on the right side especially around my period. i've been to the obgyn a few times she has stated it is not an std a bacterial infection or a yeast infection. what else could it be? i've tried diflucan monistat bacterial treatments creams. nothing really helps except for a good wash and sometimes ph balance soap. been going on 3+ years on and off.

Question: currently taking 75mg of paxil for anxiety. noticing it is not working as well as before. what should i add to it? . i have been on 75mg of paxil cr for three years for treating my panic attacks and general anxiety. it has worked very well. about three weeks ago i started noticing some anxiety creeping back in and i know i'm maxed out on the paxil. should i ask my doctor about adding something like abilify or some other drug to help boost me back to where i was? or should i seek a different ssri altogether? i'm nervous about the latter simply because the paxil has worked so well for so long. thanks!
Answer: hi if you google natural ways out of anxiety then this could be the answer. good luck
Expected Response: you are correct in suspecting that the paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions. many of the ssri's including zoloft and prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement. after several years of reliable benefit these ssri's may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms. i would not recommend taking abilify. it has been shown to have many serious side-effects including affecting blood sugar results. while i understand that you do not want to give-up on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine.

================================================================================
Question: what activities should i not do while pregnant?
Answer: i am not sure what you mean by "during pregnancy" but it is a good idea to have your doctor tell you what activities you should not do during pregnancy. it is important to keep in mind that it is not always possible to tell a good time to do these activities. for example you may not be able to see your baby until you are about two weeks pregnant. in addition it is best to take your baby to the doctor when you are not feeling well. you may be able talk to your doctor about other activities that you may like to do while you are pregnant. if you are having problems with your bladder you should talk to a doctor about doing these activities and getting a test done.
Expected Response: change the cat's litter box. cat feces can transmit an infection called toxoplasmosis which can lead to severe problems in newborns including low birth weight jaundice mental retardation and convulsions. use saunas hot tubs and tanning booths. excessive heat can be harmful to the baby and has been linked to spinal malformations. paint. let somebody else paint the baby's room; pregnant women shouldn't be exposed to toxic substances and chemicals which include paint and cleaning solvents. get an x-ray. unless you absolutely have to avoid tests like x-rays and mammograms while pregnant which can be dangerous to your growing baby. if you absolutely must have an x-ray make sure that your doctor or dentist knows you are pregnant so they can take extra precautions. ride the great american scream machine or the tower of terror. there is concern that the rapid stops and jarring forces of rides like this could cause placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall). play it safe and stick to the ferris wheel until the baby's born.

Question: i banged my thumb months ago and have had a black bruise under the nail since then. why has this not gotten better?
Answer: it is not possible to diagnose a bruise without a physical exam. the only way to know for sure is to have it examined by a medical professional.
Expected Response: it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma -- a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic.

Question: had sex with no condom during "fertile" days while on the pill. is it likely that i could get pregnant? . i have been on the pill for almost a year. my boyfriend and i are exclusive and are tested for stds. he ejaculated inside me with no condom on one of my "fertile" days. just a little nervous about getting pregnant and have another 2 weeks or so before my next period. i am also very worried about getting sick.
Answer: hi if you have a condom on then you can get pregnant. but you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: hi but did you not say that your on the bc pill bc stands for birth control of which i think is about 99 5% wont get you pregnant. well in another two weeks get your self tested. if you was that worried why did you not use a plan b to late now though. hope this helps. good luck

Question: is it safe to put wart remover on a skin tag? . i am a bit worried about the possibility of getting a wart that has been removed but i am not sure if it is safe to do that. i have a wart on my face that is not red but has a wart and i have been using it for about 2 months now. i do not want to get it on my skin.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are dealing with this. i would strongly suggest you see your dermatologist. i am sure he or she will be able to advise you on the best way to treat your skin condition. i hope you feel better soon!
Expected Response: well it may not be dangerous but it won't help either. and you could get a mild skin burn. warts are caused by a virus. warts usually resemble hard rough bumps on the skin. they usually go away on their own after a few months. as you already know you can use an over-the-counter wart remover to help get rid of them faster. skin tags on the other hand are soft floppy growths of excess skin cells. they often occur in areas where clothing rubs the skin or where skin rubs against other skin. for example you might get skin tags around your neck where your shirt collar rubs or you may get skin tags in your groin area where the skin folds rub together. because skin tags are not caused by the virus that causes warts it won't do any good to put wart remover on them. if the skin tags are bothering you you can ask your health care provider to snip them off. it's a simple relatively painless procedure. unless the skin tags are very small you shouldn't try snipping them off yourself because you could experience excessive bleeding or scarring. ask your healthcare provider if it's ok for you to snip off your own skin tags before you attempt it yourself. skin tags can be really annoying! don't feel embarrassed to talk to your healthcare professional about how to get rid of them the next time you have an office visit.
================================================================================
Question: what causes emphysema?
Answer: emphysesma is caused by an imbalance of the immune system. the body's immune system is designed to fight infections. the immune systems are made up of cells that produce chemicals that make the body more susceptible to infection. this imbalance can cause an emphysis. emphytic emphyssia is a condition in which the body does not produce enough of the body’s own cells to fight off the infection. empysema can be caused by: a buildup of dead cells in the body (such as a heart valve or a lung tumor) that is not adequately protected from infection. an infection that is caused when the body stops producing enough of its own cells. an empytic empeytic emphesis is a disease in which a person’re immune system does not respond to the immune response that is needed to fight infection.
Expected Response: in the vast majority of people smoking is the cause of emphysema. exactly how smoking destroys the air sac linings in the lungs isn't known. however studies show that smokers are about six times more likely to develop emphysema than nonsmokers. estimates vary but more than 10 million people in the u. s. likely have emphysema or another form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the fourth-leading cause of death in the country. interestingly most heavy smokers do not develop emphysema. why some smokers get emphysema and others do not is unknown. all heavy smokers experience other negative health effects of smoking though.

Question: child had been immunized for chickenpoks and came in contact with shingles virus during contagious stage can they get it. my child is scheduled for a surgery and has recently been exposed to the shingles virus during the open blister stage. obviously worried have pre-op this week but curious for answer prior to meeting with dr.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a very serious infection. the chickenpox virus is a virus that can spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. if you're concerned about the shingle virus you should contact your doctor or health care provider immediately. you can get the shingo virus from your doctor's office or by calling the national hotline at 1-800-222-1222.
Expected Response: the incubation period for chicken pox virus (herpes) is about 2 weeks or so. causal exposure to someone with shingles in a child who has been immunized (i don't know your child's age or if your child had one or two vaccines) is not likely to lead to a disease outbreak. discuss it with her doctor anyway.

Question: can the sweat chloride be high without having cystic fibrosis?
Answer: cystic is a term that refers to a condition in which the body's immune system fights off a virus that may be causing the disease. cystic disease can be caused by any of the following: viral infections. viruses can cause cystic cystic syndrome. cysts can grow on the skin. cyst infections can cause a rash or blister. cypilomas can develop in the skin and are more common in older people. cypsillomas can grow in the mouth. cyphillomas are more easily treated with antibiotics.
Expected Response: there are a few rare conditions that produce a false positive sweat chloride test. such situations include diseases of the adrenal thyroid or pituitary glands; rare lipid storage diseases; and infection of the pancreas. generally however these children are easily differentiated from patients with cystic fibrosis by their clinical condition and molecular tests for cystic fibrosis can be done to clarify the diagnosis.
================================================================================
Question: is a vegan diet healthy for my 3 year old son?
Answer: no. there is no nutritional value in a vegan-based diet.
Expected Response: with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!

Answer: you may need to see a medical provider. it is not uncommon for a person with asthmatic disorder to develop an anxiety disorder. it may be best to see an ent specialist for a proper examination and treatment.
Expected Response: there are two types of asthma medication. one is a rescue (albuterol or xopenex) that is used as needed for symptoms. the other is a controller therapy that is used every day to prevent symptoms. advair is a controller therapy and should be used daily instead of as needed. typically use of the drug should not cause you to need it more.

Question: is erythema multiforme an autoimmune disorder?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's always tough to say what's going on with an autoimmune disease. we know that many people with autoimmune disorders have a very difficult time controlling their symptoms. but we also know that a diagnosis is not always easy. sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference between a disease and a disease that has nothing to do with it. so we have to have a hands-on assessment of what's causing the symptoms. i think we're seeing a lot of patients with an aneurysm who have been diagnosed with aneurism or aneurisia and they're not able to control their symptoms with medication. so it's really important that we have a diagnosis. we want to make sure that we're treating the symptoms as effectively as possible. i'd suggest you go to your primary care provider for a hands on assessment. he or she can give you a diagnosis
Expected Response: erythema multiforme is considered a hypersensitivity disorder not an autoimmune disorder. <link>

Expected Response: do you have lots of gas in first trimester

Question: can a viral infection cause knee problems? my boyfriend's knees are stiff and painful. his knee caps are ok. thnak you can take a couple of drops of a warm bath to help.
Answer: hi just google knee pain and arthritis and knee pain for more info just google it. good luck
Expected Response: a viral infection should not cause knee pain and stiffness. does he have pain in any other joints? if not he should see an ortopaedic md and have it looked at. he should try to excercise as often as he can by walking. he certainly should not try running as running puts a lot of strain on the knees and the joints of the knees. his knee caps may "look" ok but just looking at them isn't enough to tell if he has something more serious possibly needing in the future knee replacement. he should try taking aleve or some otc medication walk as much as he can and consult his physician

Answer: you should discuss the risks of getting an iUD with your doctor. it is important to discuss the benefits and risks of having an iuud.

Question: how long do alcohol withdrawals last. i have been an fairly heavy drinker for 20 years i am now 39 years old i have not had a drink in 19 days my withdrawal symptoms are nausea headache dizzy lightheaded wobbly eyes off balance at times hard to breath at times the list goes on if anyone out there can give me some advice or let me know when this will taper down please let me know thank you.
Answer: hi try this google natural ways out of alcohol withdrawal and how to do it try this link from www. natural waysoutofdrinking. com its from the uk's nhs. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption. you are describing a condition called alcohol withdrawal syndrome. withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently. some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms. around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity. at this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control. some of these symptoms may include: sweating headache vomiting low grade fever black-outs intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others. withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation. in situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method. your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored. based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage i strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination a. s. a. p. to assess your overall health. it is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence. no matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain you're still ahead of where you would have been without stopping. over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better. i applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life. the challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into place. you just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot. if you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot. after years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we don't get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder. best wishes for your continued success.

Question: i have yellowish bumps on the instep of my feet. i have had this bump for about a week now and it is not painful. it is a little bigger than my feet and it feels like i am going to be laying on my back. i am not sure if this is a wart or not but it feels very painful. i will be seeing my doctor soon.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'd suggest you see your primary care provider -- someone who can examine you and make an appointment with you to see what's going on. there are many things that can cause a wart to grow on your feet. you may have a yeast infection. you might have a bacterial infection. or you may be allergic to certain foods. you could have a skin infection. these are just a few of the things that could cause a rash on your foot. you need to see your doctor soon to make sure everything's fine.
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose a skin ailment without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider. he or she can look at the bumps and tell you what they are and whether or not they need to be treated. weird bumps on the feet aren't unusual because the feet take a beating from walking and get exposed to all kinds of viruses and bacteria that may be lurking on floors in carpets and so on. fortunately most of these bumps aren't serious and don't cause much harm -- other than looking funky! your primary care provider can tell you what's going on and refer you to a foot doctor if necessary. good luck!

Question: burn on foot. i spilled scalding water on my foot while cooking. i put what on it immediately followed by ice. 14 hrs later it is red and severely uncomfortable in a part of the burn. it turns white when touched but if i leave the ice off for more than ten minutes the severe pin returns. what should i do?
Answer: you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. it is important to note that you will need to take your foot to the er for treatment.
Expected Response: see a medical provider. it is not possible to blindly make patient-specific decisions about a burn over the internet. most scald burns are second degree and can be extensive. some will require prescription burn ointments and special burn dressings to limit scarring and tissue contractures. and you may need something more than otc medications for the pain. see a medical provider.

Question: can food and nutrients reverse the aging process?
Answer: no. aging is not reversible. the body is constantly changing. the changes in your blood sugar and other hormones can be reversed by diet. however there are many things that can cause the body to lose weight. the most common causes of weight loss are hormonal changes in the body's cells and changes in how your body uses energy. hormonal changes can also occur in the brain and other parts of the body. hormonal fluctuations in the blood can also be caused by changes in hormones in your body. these changes can be caused in the way you eat or how you sleep. some of the most important changes in blood sugar are changes in what your blood sugars are. changes in food and other nutrients can also cause weight loss. these can include changes in a variety of foods including certain types of fruits and vegetables and certain types and amounts of certain types (such as certain types with high cholesterol or certain types that are high in saturated fat). changes in certain
Expected Response: first we have to talk about prevention. we can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock. but you can do things like not smoking. smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible. sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself. skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild. as for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin a is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources. carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks [and] even some green things like spinach and broccoli. collards are a great source of vitamin a. vitamin d -- your skin converts sun into vitamin d but a lot of people have this sun phobia. you can get vitamin d from fortified foods like orange juice and milk. research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin d. vitamin c is critical for wound repair -- for any type of tissue maintenance -- and that applies to your skin. tomatoes citrus kiwi -- they're all great sources. it is not necessary that every formulation gives the same effect just because these are intended for a same purpose. there are some anti-aging cream reviews that can let you know about some effective results these creams are able to produce. click here to know more details anti aging cream click here to know more details ==>> <link> i guess they can help. i am 79 years old and often asked what my secret is. people say i don't look my age. i only have one secret. i don't use any fancy skin creams just a moisturizer because my skin is dry. my secret? smile. especially when you look at yourself in the mirror. give that person the best welcoming smile you can come up with. that is your best friend sometimes your only friend. a smile makes you feel better and look younger. try it. it doesn't cost a thing. smile!

Expected Response: yes she can go to school. this is just an innocent fungal infection. if the area is covered with clothing this is good enough. if not just losely cover it with a band-aid. keep using the antifungal cream. it can take several weeks before it resolves.

Question: medication for prostate infection. i've been diagnosed with a bacterial prostate infection and have been prescribed a hefty dose of antibiotics. 400mg sparfloxacin daily and 200mg fluconazole daily starting with a 400mg dose. reading up on your webpage though beforehand i see that this combination is not recommended due to potentially serious side effects. should i just ignore both medications and seek new advice take one of them or.? after reading online i don't quite feel comfortable in going with this prescription. thanks.
Answer: you should definitely take your antibiotics. you are not likely to get a urinary tract infection (uti) from taking antibiotics. antibiotics can cause inflammation of the urinary tract. you should be careful with the antibiotic dose as well. i would suggest you see your primary care provider for a proper examination and treatment. he or she may be able to help you decide if you need to take more antibiotics.
Expected Response: hi when looking up info on line make sure you read a lot more than just one site this way you should get more than just one opinion all there all saying the same thing. then perhaps your doctor or gyno thinks by doing this its going to give it that extra kick for a cure sometimes it needs it. but as you say if your not happy find another doctor/gyno and get a second opinion but please explain why your doing it. good luck

Expected Response: no one can be adequately diagnosed over the internet based solely on a description. you will need to be examined by a medical provider since there can be sooooo many reasons. it is possible that not all of your symptoms are "connected" (a person can have more than one medical issue at the same time). you may need a strep test for your throat. or even a test for mononucleosis but a medical provider would need to make that decision based on your examination findings.

Question: what can you tell me about adhd diets?
Answer: adhd is a condition that can occur in a number of different areas of the body including the legs legs and hips. the most common cause of adhd in the u. s. is a lack of energy. it is a problem that affects people of all ages and races. the cause of the problem is not known. it can be caused by a variety of conditions including: low testosterone. low testosterone is a hormone that controls blood levels of certain hormones. it may also be caused from a variety other conditions including high blood pressure diabetes heart disease and certain cancers. high blood cholesterol. high cholesterol is a cholesterol-lowering hormone that can cause adhd symptoms. it's also known as high blood sugar. high triglycerides are a type of cholesterol that can be found in the blood. high levels of these cholesterol can cause problems with heart disease diabetes and certain cancer. high bp. high bilirubin levels are a blood
Expected Response: diets are generally not effective -- especially for school-age children or teens. sugar and food coloring are not the cause of adhd nor are food allergies in general. (food coloring can have a small barely measurable effect but this is not the cause of your child's adhd. ) that said there are a few "nutriceuticals" that may improve adhd. studies are limited; the amount of benefit is likely to be less than medication and they may not benefit all kids with adhd.

Question: can i stop taking flomax once i have passed the kidney stone? . i am a generally healthy 52 year old female. last week i was diagnosed with a 5mm kidney stone and was prescribed flomax to help pass the stone. i passed it about three days later and now i am wondering if i can stop taking flomax. the urologist said i would have to take it for a month then have a follow up ultrasound to make sure i don't have hydronephrosis. i find the side effects i'm experiencing (headaches stuffy nose and nose bleed) very annoying.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's not uncommon for a kidney stone to come back in a few days. it could be an infection or a complication of a kidney infection. you need to see your medical provider to make an appointment with your primary care provider or health-care provider. i suggest you contact your primary health-center for a referral.
Expected Response: i definitely would not stop taking the fosamax without first talking to your doctor. you don't want to risk having more problems with kidney stones. the side effects you list are not commonly associated with fosamax. of course everyone is different and it's possible that they're associated with the medicine but it could also be something else. there are also other medications similiar to fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine.

Question: what can cause an infant boys scrotum to swell? . my 10 month old son has developed an almond sized lump in his scrotal sac over the last two days. it has grown somewhat over the last 24 hours. it has not changed in color or shape just size. i can see his testicles and the lump is higher up in the scrotum right under his penis and a little to the left. i think it may be an inguinal hernia but am wondering if it could possibly be something else. anyone have an instances of this?
Answer: i would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: his pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him. it is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description. yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele. a torsion (twisting) is also possible but these are very painful and quite serious. i suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly "de-torse" in some children. either way an examine will be required to make that important determination. if he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis.
================================================================================
Question: how effective are allergy shots for asthma sufferers?
Answer: allergy shots are not recommended for asthma patients. they may cause a temporary decrease in the ability of the immune system to fight off the disease.
Expected Response: for people with allergic asthma allergy shots (immunotherapy) can be effective at reducing allergic triggers to asthma. an allergist would evaluate to determine if he/she thinks you would benefit from allergy shots. asthma should be controlled as best as possible with medications before starting allergy shots. . because you are being injected with things you are allergic to there is a risk of having an allergic reaction. most patients do not have any side effects and those that experience side effects typically have localized itching and swelling at the injection side. in very rare cases people experience severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. most cases of anaphylaxis happen shortly after the allergy shots are given that is why you are required to be monitored in the clinic for a period of time. the allergy office is prepared with the needed medications to treat patients with severe reactions. the risk of a fatal reaction is extremely small but there have been a few cases of patients having fatal reactions. because of this it will be important that you understand the protocol and instructions for the allergy shots. there are many safety procedures in place to prevent serious reactions. if you have any questions about the protocol or risk you should thoroughly discuss with your allergist before starting.

Question: does body hair grow at the same rate as the hair on your head?

Question: i have a hiatal hernia. it seems to bother me more after exercise especially after crunches. is there a connection?
Answer: hi if you have a hernia then you will need to see your doctor for a test but this may be a good idea. good luck
Expected Response: i also have a hiatal hernia. this condition is caused when the abdominal organs start to poke thru the abdominal cavity and press against the diaphram. because of this when you do crunches you are putting pressure on the area that you have the hernia at. also when you do any exercise you tend to breath faster. this can be uncomfortable as well because the hernia is pressing on your diaphram which expands when you take a breath. i hope this helps!

Question: i am a 45 year old man and have little facial hair basically i have no sideburns. what can i do to promote hair growth? . i do have some facial hair (chin cheeks neck) but there are other bare patches as well. this didn't bother me when i was younger but as i age i would like the option of growing a beard to mask skin blemishes wrinkles etc. what are my options? what can i start to do on my own and if that doesn't work when should i consult my doctor?
Answer: i would suggest you talk to your dermatologist. he or she can help you find a good hair grower. there are many different types of hair growths and genetics. you can also look up a good hairstylist by visiting www. hairgrower. com.
Expected Response: there is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair. if those hair follicles were not present when you were born you can't grow new ones. it is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get. i don't think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine. testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help. your first step is to see a dermatologist.

Question: if a man is dieting exercising at least 3 to 4 times a week having ed having a hard time losing weight. low t? . my husband and i have been doing a lot of exercise and we have been trying to lose weight. we have tried to lose it with dieting and exercise but it has been hard to do. we are trying to get a good start. we don't want to take any risks with exercise and weight loss.
Answer: i don't know what your husband is doing but it sounds like he is doing a pretty good job of losing weight and gaining muscle. he is also doing a good job at keeping his weight down. he may be doing a bit of a bit more than he should be doing. if you are trying for a healthy weight loss try to be as healthy as possible. if he is trying to gain weight he needs to be more active. he needs more calories. he also needs to eat more. he should also be more motivated. if
Expected Response: well it could be. or it might not be. low testosterone (or "low t") is the flavor-of-the-month in men's health. it's blamed for everything from lack of energy to low libido. and while low testosterone certainly might contribute to those things it's probably not the sole underlying cause. many things can cause slow weight loss and erectile dysfunction (ed). your best bet is to see your primary care provider for a range of blood tests. these basic tests can help pinpoint the cause(s) of your current health conditions and get you on the path to wellness. by the way good job on the diet and exercise! even though things are slow going keep up the good work. wishing you well!

Answer: hi if you google natural ways out of stress then you will find lots of info on natural ways to cope with stress. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi this bit below is from webmd so show her this it may help both of you. sometimes you may notice that your menstrual blood becomes dark brown or almost black as you near the end of your period. this is a normal colour change. it happens when the blood is older and not being expelled from the body quickly. temporary thick heavy flow isn't necessarily cause for concern. however regular heavy periods justify a trip to the doctor to check your blood counts. many women become accustomed to heavy periods considering them to be normal. over time though the excess monthly blood loss leads to anemia potentially causing weakness or fatigue. if you ever feel something's not right with your period see your health care provider. as for the pains could be just cramping has she had anything like this before? do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: is there a drug interaction between synthroid and prevacid?
Answer: synthroid is a generic name for a class of medications called "synthroid-selective" drugs. it is also called a "synthyroid-dopamine" or "synestroid-susceptible" drug.
Expected Response: currently there are no drug interactions found between synthroid and prevacid. however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist. it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products. prevacid should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal. synthroid should be taken 30 minutes to one hour prior to a meal. they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach.

Question: what does genital herpes look like?
Answer: genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. it is caused by the herpes virus. genital herpes can be caused by any of the following: direct contact with someone who has genital herpes. direct contact can be from kissing touching or sharing needles or utensils. direct oral contact with infected people. direct sexual contact with an infected person. direct exposure to an infected partner. direct direct contact is a common form of genital herpes and is not contagious.
Expected Response: anything from classic blisters that ooze pus after bursting and scab and heal over to almost imperceptible lesions red marks white areas and other hard to notice patches. men and women may have differences too. there is some good info at this site: www. viradux. com. they also sell a crème that is the only thing that has worked for me. i have not had an outbreak in over a year. hope this helps!

Question: what could be causing my scalp to suddenly become dry and flaky? . i have been experiencing dry scalp for about a week now. i have tried moisturizers and products and they have all failed. i am also noticing a change in my scalp. i don't know what is causing this.
Answer: hi just google scalp dryness and flaking and its all there you can find it all there. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: to figure this out first look at what type of hair products you are using. certain shampoos can be harsh or drying to the scalp. try switching to a shampoo that is marketed for dry hair or one that claims to add moisture to your hair. if this doesn't help you may need to see your local dermatologist to have your scalp examined for psoriasis seborrhea or another form of scalp dermatitis. a biopsy may be necessary to fully understand what's going on.

Question: im 17 and have rapid heartbeat shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat. whats wrong with me? . i am a 17 year old female with shortness-of- breath shortness/breath and irregular heartbeats. i have been diagnosed with a heart attack in july 2012. i am currently taking a home medication that has been prescribed for my heart. i'm not sure if it's working or not. i feel like i'm going to die.
Answer: i would need to see a cardiologist. i don't know anything about you and i don’t know what your medical history is but i do know that you have a history of heart disease. i would also like to know if you have any other health problems that could be contributing to your shortness or shortness (shortness of breaths) symptoms. i also know that there are many things that can cause shortness in the heart. if you are experiencing any of these symptoms i would suggest you see a
Expected Response: most helpful answer i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds frightening! i'd advise you to seek medical attention as soon as possible. any time a person has heart-related symptoms it's a good idea to get checked out by a doctor. while serious heart conditions aren't very common in people your age it's still a good idea to have the situation evaluated. your health care provider probably will want to run a series of tests including a blood test to check things like your hormone levels and overall blood count. he or she also may run other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ekg) or even a holter monitor which is portable ekg device. anxiety can produce symptoms similar to what you're describing too. however do not try to self-diagnose this. your health care provider will be able to figure out what's causing your symptoms and how to treat them (if at all). good luck to you!

Question: i have tried aloe for sunburn but it doesn't seem to help. can i use burow's solution or aspirin?
Answer: aloe is a very effective topical sunblock. it is very effective in preventing and treating sunburns. it does not contain any active ingredients. it can be used to prevent sunburning and prevent other sunburn conditions. it works by blocking the growth of the sunburn virus.
Expected Response: believe it or not aloe is a popular product that's available on all the shelves but there is no evidence that it actually works in helping sunburns. so this is actually a good question. burow's solution is usually used for poison ivy. it helps relieve the itching not necessarily redness or inflammation. so the rule of thumb is if you have sunburn what you want to do is definitely use cool compresses or sit in like a cool tub filled for about 15-20 minutes. you can take things like tylenol or advil to help alleviate any type of pain. but if the sunburn is really bad and you start breaking out in blisters you need to see a medical professional for additional prescription products and also just to be evaluated to make sure you didn't do any additional damage to the skin.
================================================================================
Question: what organ controls blood pressure. what organ regulates our blood pressure causing it to rise or lower?
Answer: there are two main types of blood pressure control: the blood pressure-lowering blood pressure (bmi) control and the bmi control. the bm control is the most common type of blood control. it is used to control blood pressure in the upper arm and lower arm. the lower arm blood pressure is usually controlled by the blood vessels in the lower leg. the blood vessel control is also called the blood cell control. this control is used in people with diabetes. the reason for the blood cells to be in the blood is that the blood flow to the blood chambers in the arm and legs is slowed. this slows the blood to the point where it cannot be used to treat diabetes.
Expected Response: the brain. there really is no one organ that controls blood pressure. blood pressure is controlled through how much blood goes through your heart and a delicate body balance achieved through the cardiovascular central nervous and urinary systems. neurotransmitters in the brain signal the heart to beat quicker and increase blood pressure when it becomes too low. the change in your heart beating then changes the volume and force of blood going through the kidneys and the sodium balance. this action further impacts the fluid in your blood vessels and either lowers or increases your blood pressure.

Question: can a woman get pregnant if she had her period 2 days after sex and it was heavy the first day and light 3 days after? . i had sex with a guy the other night. he used a condom but for some reason did not last very long (5 minutes). he pulled it out the second he started ejeculating in the condom and completely finished outside of me. the condom fit perfectly and nor did it tear or nothing leaked out. we had sex june 9th at 1 am. the first day of my last period was may 15th to may 20th. my periods are irregular and come different days in the month. i began my heavy period again june 11th lasting 4 days. i am very tired and have a sore throat.
Answer: hi ok you can try this link from the uk’s nhs just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: a woman can theoretically become pregnant anytime she has unprotected sex but in reality there are only a few days per month that you can actually conceive. based on what you have shared you were not likely at at time of ovulation and your sperm encounter was outside and not intravaginally. it would be highly unlikely that you would become pregnant in this event.
================================================================================
Question: where can i get the cheapest morning after pill since i don't have insurance?
Answer: the best way to get a good morning after is to get an appointment with your primary health care provider. he or she can help you select a plan that is best for you.
Expected Response: when it comes to inexpensive pharmaceuticals you may need to call around to various pharmacies and even planned parenthood and ask prices. i don't think you will find that much variation in price. since this is over the counter insurance may not cover it anyway even if you had it. remember that this is the "morning after" pill so you don't have that much time to comparison shop. i can assure you that if you are hoping to prevent a pregnancy as a result of unprotected sex the consequences of not doing this promptly is going to be a lot more expensive if you know what i mean. this method may be pricey if you are on a tight budget but it is too late to use condoms now. they would have been less expensive so lesson learned.

Question: is shingles a single blister or a rash? . my dad has a single red painful sore in his ear. a pa asked if he had his zoster shot and now he is convinced he has shingles in his ear. there are no other sores no rash just pain at the site and in his jaw in front of the ear. i have no way of seeing this rash on his ear but i do have a feeling that it could be a herpes virus.
Answer: hi the best way to get rid of it would be to get a blood test done. ok good luck
Expected Response: sort of both depending on the stage of the infection. shingles will mostly present as painful blisters.

Question: has anyone experienced strong vaginal odor while going through menopause? . i was on a menopatrol (a steroid) and my doctor prescribed me a shot of lisinopril. i had a hysterectomy and i had to have a hysterectomy to get my uterus to work. i was able to get pregnant and my period came in a few days later. i'm a little worried about the possibility that my period is coming sooner or later.
Answer: hi if you have been on this for a while then it may be time to see your doctor and get some tests done to see if it is the right time to get your period back. good luck
Expected Response: the most common cause of bad odor coming from the vagina is a condition called bacterial vaginosis also called gardnerella. the odor stems from an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that causes a strong fishy odor. the odor is worse after intercourse because the ph of the semen causes more of the odor to be released. prescription pills or cream can usually eliminate the bacterial imbalance. in premenopausal women a not uncommon cause of bad odor is a forgotten tampon. removal of the tampon will correct the problem. gentle cleansing of the vulva with clean water is usually sufficient for hygiene. any soap can be irritating to the vulva and in some cases can cause dermatitis skin irritation or rash. in most cases douching is not recommended. a very strong or unusual odor should be evaluated by a clinician. yes; i was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop- just kind of cold turkey. i had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came. my general health care provider could not help me. i found a gynocologist who would see me. (i was turned down by one who said i was too old. ) he put me on vagifem and it cleared up. that was three years ago. the experience was very traumatic.

Question: can a woman be pregnant 14 days after sexual intercourse? . i had unprotected sexual intercouirse with a woman who after 14 days came back to tell me that she is pregnant. my question here is that; could it be possible and i am confused since i have never heard such thing. please help me out here?
Answer: hi if you think you may be pregnant then you should get on a bc pill its a great way to get pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi it seems somebody need to do some research on getting a girl/women pregnant then you will find its possible to get them pregnant from any time of the month unlike some who can get pregnant from the 2 two fertile days of the month if they are lucky the getting pregnant thing is to some men a whole mystery but it happens and with you apart from doing blood tests when the baby is born you will just have to accept till then that your the daddy. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my lower right side of abdomen has been hurting. can it be my ovary? . i have been to the er and urgent care thinking it was my appendix. they has told me that it might be my ovaries but didn't check them. the pain comes and goes but it hurts the most when i am sitting down. can it be my ovaries? does having cyst in the ovaries cause a female not to get a menstrual cycle? i have also been trying to get pregnant and no luck. <negative_smiley>
Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: you don't have appendicitis because appendicitis is not a come and go pain. appendicitis is extremely painful. the thing you have is actually caused by extra fluid form your system being trapped in your air vent. but if you are trying to become pregnant do not put too much pressure on yourself. that is probably why you have abdomen pain. and you can also take women pills for pregnancy. that wont really make you pregnant but it will prepare your body for pregnancy. you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have abdomen pain and you think it is from your ovaries.

Question: i am taking strattera and the generic of celexa. is that safe for a pregnancy?
Answer: hi if you have been taking celexanine for 3 months now and you have not had an std it is safe to take it as it is a very good medicine for women who have had an uti. good luck
Expected Response: i always get questions like this in my practice setting and i am more than happy to assist since pharmacists are the medication experts. we do not have enough data for these two medications and they should only be used based on a physician’s evaluation and there is a clear understanding of the risks and benefits.

Question: what is recommended dosage of vitamins c and e for early alzheimer patient?
Answer: the recommended dosage is recommended for people with alzheimers. it is recommended that you take at least one daily dose of vitamin c and vitamin e. the recommended daily dose is recommended to take at the same time every day.
Expected Response: there are no "recommended doses" of either vitamin. studies have not proven that vitamin c or e have any therapeutic or preventative effects in the management of early alzheimer disease. with that said you can certainly use them at regular recommended doses but mega-doses would not likely be helpful.

Question: i had a tubal 10 years ago i am having early pregnancy symptoms could it be i am pregnant?
Answer: hi i would say yes you could have had a tube inserted in your womb just in case but if you think its just a little bit of a shock then yes it could be. good luck
Expected Response: my cousin had this situation. she thought there was no way she could be pregnant after 12 years of the one tube she had left (due to a tubal pregnancy if the other) being burnt and tied. she called her ob/gyn and the dr. told her if she was pregnant it was most likely a tubal. she packed a bag thinking she would be put in the hospital for surgery. the dr. did an ultrasound and she was almost two months pregnant. her and the baby were very healthy. but it was a big surprise. she was 39 and thought she was through having kids. now she is the mother of a 23 year old a 18 year old and a 6 year old. good luck! either way all babies are a blessing!

Question: i have a burning sensation in my face neck and ears that comes and goes. what could be causing this? . just curious to what could be going on. i suspect high bloodpressure but am not able to see my doctor until april 4 due to her being booked up until then. i am really worried that it could be something very serious. please help?
Answer: hi if you are not in a good place then you may have to go see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: i have the exact same symptoms. they come and go in intensity but i am getting it very often these days. i think it is because our nerves are irritated from being damaged. my theory is that it is herpes as that virus lives in nerve cluster behind the ear. and the herpes zooster and many viruses reside in nerves and herpes kills nerve cells causing them to become irritated leading to a burning sensation. this is why so many people have this problem but have no clue what is the reason most people have no idea they have herpes. it is most likely to be triggered by a number of reasons. but being fit keeping your immune system healthy and eating foods that don't trigger the virus should greatly help possibly keep it completely at bay.

Question: should i watch tv in bed if i have insomnia?
Answer: hi if you do have a problem with your sleep then you need to get some help from your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: well i am a little bit different in the respects that most doctors especially sleep specialists will say you should have no tv in the bedroom. i actually disagree. i have a select group of patients where they can’t turn their brains off and that’s why they have insomnia. if they could just watch some mundane television show to help them fall asleep they fall asleep very well. so what i tell people is if you’re going to fall asleep with the tv on just have a tv timer that will switch your tv off.

Question: does isoniazid affect the good bacteria in digestive system. what are some side effects?
Answer: many people with bad bacteria can get a yeast infection. if you have bad bacteria you may have a yeast-like infection. this is a very common side effect of the yeast. if your doctor or health care provider recommends that you avoid the use of antibiotics for this reason you should consult your doctor.
Expected Response: hi this is from site and this is the link to it <link> for more help just google the link to the www. to open and read. isoniazid may cause severe and sometimes fatal liver problems (eg hepatitis). the risk of liver problems is greater in patients older than 35 years old. it may also be increased by daily use of alcohol long-term liver problems or unsanitary injectable drug use. women especially those who are black are hispanic or have just had a baby may also be at increased risk. hepatitis can develop at any time during treatment but usually occurs during the first 3 months. your doctor will monitor your liver function and discuss your progress every month. contact your doctor right away if you develop unusual fatigue weakness or fever that lasts longer than 3 days general feeling of discomfort loss of appetite nausea vomiting numbness or tingling of the hands or feet dark urine yellowing of the skin or eyes or stomach pain or tenderness. your doctor may decide to slowly restart isoniazid after these symptoms disappear and lab tests return to normal. patients with active liver problems should not use isoniazid. your find lots more info on site this does not seem a very nice drug to be taken. good luck

Question: i had sex and the next day i ovulate can i be pregnant? . i have been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend and he ejaculated in me and i ejaculated inside of me. i am not pregnant. i have had unprotected sex before and i have not had any symptoms of pregnancy.
Answer: hi ok you could be pregnant if you have been on birth control for a long time and you have a lot of hormones it could be your hormones are working. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: the life span of sperm after ejaculation depends on the circumstances. sperm ejaculated into a woman's vagina can live in a woman's cervical mucus or upper genital tract for three to five days. fertilization is possible as long as the sperm remain alive. so it is possible that u may get pregnant

Question: i missed my birth control pill friday and had unprotected sex saturday morning what are my chances of getting pregnant? . i had unprotected unprotected sex with my boyfriend and he took a pill that morning. he then took another pill saturday and we had unprotected intercourse saturday. we also had unprotected anal sex on saturday night. we have been trying to get pregnant but i'm afraid i'll miss my pill and i'm scared i'll be pregnant.
Answer: hi if you miss your pill then it would be best you get a test done at your doctors or clinic. good luck
Expected Response: hi missing one pill is not so bad did you double up on saturday then? some women do that so that would have helped if not you should have still been covered. perhaps this will help slow down your anxiety's. good luck

Question: can a male get genital herpes from performing oral sex on uninfected female? . i have a male who is infected with genital herpes. he is a male. he has been exposed to genital herpes since the age of 12. he was exposed to the virus by performing oral sexual acts on uninformed female. he also has a history of not being able to get the virus from oral sex. he will not get it from performing the oral sex unless he is infected. he needs to have a medical professional examine him for the virus.
Answer: genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. it can be spread by direct contact with someone else. the only way to know for sure if you are infected is to get tested. if you have genital herpes you are at higher risk for getting it. if the virus is not transmitted to you by direct sexual contact you should not be infected.
Expected Response: i can't see how unless he is very lucky and talented. you don't get genital herpes by touching someone with your mouth the most you'd get is oral herpes. you don't get any kind of herpes by touching an uninfected person. so the only way a man could get genital herpes by giving an uninfected woman oral sex is if the female had just had sex with someone with the condition and he left his fluids on her then another man had oral sex with her then gave himself fellatio. highly unlikely.

Question: before bed my blood sugar and it is 103. in the morning my blood sugar level is at 87. does this mean i have diabetes?
Answer: yes it can. but it is important to remember that many people with diabetes do not have a normal blood sugar. in fact the blood sugar levels are not normal. the body can't control the sugar levels it needs to. the pancreas can't regulate the sugar level so it can't be controlled.
Expected Response: no these readings do not say that you have diabetes. they are basically normal readings

Question: is it safe to use nail polish while pregnant?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. nail polish is great for making baby-looking baby-shaped nails. but there are a number of reasons why you might want to use it. first and most important: it can make baby-like nails look a little more like you actually are. the nail polish can be a little bit harsh and may be a bit too harsh for your skin. second and most importantly: it's a lot easier to apply it to the skin than it is to the nail itself. if you're pregnant it's important to use a nail polish that's gentle enough to be applied to the area you’re pregnant. it can be applied on the face or under the skin. it's also a lot cheaper than nail polish on the market. if your nail polish has a lot of chemical residue it's really important to reapply it every couple of weeks. the chemical residue can be irritating
Expected Response: phthalates which are found in many nail polishes have been studied for a potential risk of causing birth defects. however evidence does not currently suggest a connection between phthalates and birth defects in humans. but studies in animals have shown these substances interfere with male sexual development so caution may be warranted. to be on the safe side you can use phthalate-free nail polish. or polish your nails in a well-ventilated area to limit your exposure. once the polish dries there's little risk to your baby since chemicals aren't absorbed through the nails. here's a great article on pregnancy-proofing your beauty regimen. i personally avoided most nail polish when i was pregnant. the story below says to avoid polish with phthalates which have been linked to birth defects. look at the ingredients list on your polish to be sure. if you go to a salon and are not sure if they carry phthlate-free brands take your own. some brands said to be free of phthlates include essie revlon and l'oreal but remember to check the label as they come out with new types all the time. none of these links are definitely proven of course but why not play it safe until we know for sure? <link>

Question: could i conceive 2day before my fertile window days? . hello im trying to conceive my period was oct 8 to oct11 had unprotected sex on oct 13 i believe its two days before my fertile window days could i possibly have a chance of pregnancy? thank you
Answer: hi it would be best if you have a test done at your doctors and you have not had unprotected intercourse yet its a test you will need to get a test if you do get pregnant its a very good test but for now just wait till you get your period. good luck
Expected Response: hi your find that most will say ovulation day is around day14 give or take a day so yes by that you could get pregnant and this allows 3 days for the sperm to reach the womb that's how long its takes sperm to get there and it can live for up to 10 days max. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is the recovery period for bilateral knee replacement?
Answer: the recovery time is determined by the severity of the knee replacement and the severity and severity of pain that is caused by the knee. if the recovery is a long time then you may need to see your primary care provider to see if there is any change in the quality of your knee replacement.
Expected Response: recovery from bilateral total knee arthroplasty can be very challenging. those individuals that have gone through it can confirm it first hand. like all things in medicine some people will recover quicker than others. in our practice most people that undergo bilateral tka [total knee arthroplasty] spend some period of time in a rehabilitation center after leaving the inpatient setting. i like to think that people are about 75% recovered at 6 weeks but it often seems like people make continued recovery all the way out to one year following surgery. this seems to hold relatively true for patients following single tka and therefore you can imagine that the recovery process could be even longer and more challenging when both are done at the same time. if you feel like you are making progress each day or week or even each month then you are probably headed to a good long term result. there are certainly times that patients will get discouraged by the challenge of recovery but remember that the overwhelming majority of patients that have the operation experience improvement in pain function and quality of life.

Question: hi my mother 85 y suffer from lumber. s. s she need exercise for her knee kindly advise since she stand (with walker) and stand up. she has arthritis. she needs exercise for knee. she is very tired. she also has arthritis in her knees. she would like to exercise for arthritis. please advise her.
Answer: hi your find this is from the uk’s nhs it’ll help you find out what the problem is. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: your mother can definitely increase the strength of the muscles that surround and support the knee. the good thing is it doesn't take hours and all of them can be performed at home. 1. sit to stands starting position: sitting with both feet flat and her walker in front of her exercise: slowly and with control come to a standing position finish position: slowly and with control return to the seated position important safety and progression points 1. in the beginning let her use both arms to push up. 2. as she gets stronger and can perform 10 repetitions with little effort have her only use one arm to push up. after that progress to using no arm movement to come to standing 3. once that becomes easy switch chairs. chairs that are lower to the ground are much more difficult to get out off. however when you do this allow her to push off with both arms and progress her through just like you did before. 4. also if loss of balance or dizziness upon standing is a problem make sure someone is standing next to her when she's performing this exercise. 5. start slowly begin with just 3 repetitions and progress to 10. 2. knee extension starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat and a leg weight attached to the ankle exercise: slowly and with control straighten the leg like you were going to kick a ball finish position: slowly lower to the floor and repeat for a total of 10 times. switch the ankle weight to the other side and repeat important safety and progression points 1. with this one its better to start off with a very light weight and progress as needed as sometimes it can bother the knee. 3. hip flexion: starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat on the floor and the leg weight from the previous exercise lying on the thigh exercise: lift the leg up towards you keeping the knee bent. slowly lower and repeat for a total of 10. switch the weight to the other side and repeat just performing 1 set of 10 repetitions of each of these exercises can make a big difference in her strength and mobility. however it's important that as she gets stronger that you increase the resistance (lower chair or a heavier weight). these exercises should challenge her but not exhaust her. the key is to start small and build from there. as with any new exercise program make sure its ok with her doctor before beginning

Question: what type of physician do i need to see if i have a growth under the skin of my thumb? . it started out as pea size and now is elongated and gets in the way when doing everyday construction. it moves and almost seems like a calcium deposit. i am not sure if i need a referral for a growth specialist or not.
Answer: hi your find this is from the uk’s nhs your find the u k’ses best place to start is the uks’ national growth and health service’ website www. ukgrowth. org your find its all you need to know to get started. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: a dermatologist would be a good choice. their specialty is skin and many of them will do office procedures assuming this growth needs to be removed. many primary care providers will do this too but you will need to talk to your own to see if this is something he or she will see. this can be many things including a retained foreign body (like a splinter).

Question: i think my son took xanax. if i test him how long after could it show? don't want to waste the money if its been to long. i suspect my son taking xanax a week ago. will i be wasting my money on a test if i do a home test now. can he still show positive if he did take xanax after a week?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a drug test. i'd suggest you call your local health department to get an accurate answer. if you can't find a lab in your area it's probably worth a trip to the doctor's office. you may be able to get some help from a pharmacist who can help you find a test that's right for you.
Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely for xanax to remain in the system after a week. it clears very fast. the real question may be "why did he take xanax? ". many will take this sedative to come down from a different drug that makes them high like methamphetamines. it would not be a waste of money to drug-test your son if you suspect drug use but one negative test does not vindicate him. you may have to randomly test him from time to time to be sure. and make sure he is observed getting the specimen. many teens have some tricks.

Answer: the metered dosage inhaler is a very effective inhaler. it is designed to be used in a short time. if you are using a metering dose inhalers for more than a few minutes you may need to use a spade or other type of spacer.

Question: i am postmenopausal. can i still get pregnant? . i am 53 years old and have not had a period since may 2011. i have been on birth control for over a year now and have been taking it for about a year. i am wondering if i could still get a pregnancy?
Answer: hi if you have a normal period then you can get pregnant but the problem is if you are not having any period then that would be the time you should be looking for your doctor to tell you if you could get pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you know that's honestly a tricky question. at just over a year since your last period i wouldn't bet the farm that you couldn't get pregnant. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for an opinion. he or she can tell you if you still need to use birth control or if you're probably not ovulating anymore. i would say until you get that expert opinion if you don't want to get pregnant you should use a condom or some other form of birth control. hope this helps!

Answer: hi if you have been pregnant you should be ok its a very simple test but if you are having a problem with your periods it would be best to get it checked out by a doctor. good luck
Expected Response: anytime that you have unprotected sex and are not using any form of contraception you are at risk to getting pregnant. why did you have sex with your boyfriend without a condom? had he worn one you would not be freaking out right now. if you start showing any signs of pregnancy you will need to do a home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an examination.

Question: what tests are done to determine the cause of male infertility?
Answer: a male infertility test can detect a number of sexually-transmitted diseases including gonorrhea chlamydia and gonorrheal disease.
Expected Response: identifying the cause of a man's infertility is as much an art as a science. “the first step is an evaluation by a physician specializing in male infertility ” says stephen shaban md a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and microsurgery in raleigh north carolina. experts differ in their approach but here are some of the tests you can expect: sperm and semen analysis. they provide a private room (and magazines). you provide a fresh sample of semen. experts then assess your sperm count their shape movement and other variables. “generally a higher number of normal-shaped sperm means higher fertility ” says shaban. but exceptions are common. many men with low sperm counts or abnormal semen are still fertile. and about 15% of infertile men have normal semen and plenty of normal sperm. surprisingly the complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia) can be a good thing. lawrence ross md president of the american urological association says it might suggest a blockage in the “plumbing” that can be corrected with surgery. physical examination. a thorough physical exam can detect varicocele and give clues to hormone problems. this should ideally be performed by a urologist. hormone evaluation. testosterone and multiple hormones made in the brain control sperm production. however hormones are not the main problem in 97% of infertile men. testicular biopsy. this is done for men with very low or no sperm in their semen. a needle biopsy of the testicle can show whether a man is making healthy sperm. if abundant good sperm are found in the testicle there's likely a blockage somewhere. genetic testing. genetic tests can identify specific obstacles to fertility and problems with sperm. experts differ as to when genetic tests should be done.

Answer: hi if you have any questions just ask your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer hi this piece below has come from this site below <link> healthy bowel habits for children regular bowel movements are important to your child’s health. bowel habits—how often how much and so on—will vary from child to child. some children go more than once a day while others may skip a day or two. you can encourage healthy bowel habits by: eating healthy foods — whole grains fruits and vegetables — and drinking more water each day. children should have no more than 120 ml of 100% fruit juice per day. staying active throughout the day. this will help keep bowels working well. teaching your child not to hold a bowel movement. explaining that regular bowel movements are normal and important for good health. not using negative words like “dirty” or “stinky ” because they can make your child feel self-conscious about going to the toilet. the most common problems with bowel movements are constipation and diarrhea. look as long as it not in his pants i would not worry to much my son done much the same he normally went just as his meal was being put on the table to be honest never gave it a thought do you think your over reacting? fo me its just healthy bowels. good luck

Question: what causes pain nausea and blockage in the colon/abdomen? . i know a college aged person who has been suffering from pain and nausea. the doctors mentioned "appendigitis" (not appendicitis). she was hospitalized for days but then seemed to get better. however she is now having the same symptoms again. she is going to have exploratory surgery. she had a recent colonoscopy which showed no problem. have you heard of appendigitis? no one in the medical profession that i know seems to know what it is. in fact they have never heard of it!
Answer: the most common cause of appendicitias is a bacterial infection called "fungal" infection. it is not a bacterial disease but rather a bacterial (fungus) infection. the only way to determine the cause of this is to see a medical provider. if you are concerned about the cause you need to see your primary care provider.
Expected Response: appendagitis is basically where fleshy finger shaped growths on the outside of the large intestines called appendages get infected or inflamed. these appendages aren't entirely understood. they may serve as padding in the abdominal cavity but when they are inflamed they can cause trouble. appendagitis is a legitimate medical condition but a gi doctor is more likely to know what it is. the exploratory surgery is probably to find out the size and location of these appendages and possibly to remove them. the colonoscopy could come out normal looking because the appendages are on the outside of the large intestine not the inside. as for your friend's symptoms they all lead to each other. appendagitis could cause all the things you mention.

Question: why should people wash their hands after using the restroom? . my child told me "i wipe with toilet paper not my hand. " i would like a proper medical response to give her so she fully understands instead of me just telling her to do it. i have to tell her to wash her hands after she uses the restroom. i am very concerned that she is not washing her hands properly and is not using the toilet.
Answer: it is not recommended that people wash hands after they use the restroom unless they are breastfeeding. if you are breastfeeding and have a baby it is important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom. this is especially important if you have a breast feeding baby. washing your hands before you use a toilet is a good idea because it helps prevent infection and prevent the germs from getting in.
Expected Response: it is just not your bottom that has germs. in a bathroom there are diseas-causing germs on every surface (the countertops toilet seat handles etc). while an extremely agile and careful person may not touch their genitals or anal area they do touch surfaces. contaminated hands spread germs to other surfaces and other people. washing hands is the most important and basic of all hygiene practices. only a fool would not wash their hands.

Question: im a 45 yr old white female have mitral valve regertation. i pushed my shin bone it stayed dented no pain or swelling? . i feel ok i have a headache slight shortness of breath but i have a short fuse and hot temper.
Answer: i have no way of examining you over the internet. i would need to see your medical provider for a proper examination.
Expected Response: gotta love a person who admits she has a "short fuse and a hot temper"! i'd suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination. when you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs. this symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a check-up. it might just be that you need to cut back on salt. but it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems (besides your mitral valve regurgitation). it wouldn't be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart you've caught it early. wishing you (and your temper) all the best! sounds like fluid retention. i have the samething all the time nearly.

Question: if prenatal vitamins are extra good for you when you’re pregnant why not take them all the time?
Answer: prenatal vitamins can help you stay healthy and strong for your baby. they also can help prevent infection. the best prenatal vitamins for pregnant women are those that contain niacinamide and vitamin c. these vitamins are found in the prenatal vitamins and are also found in other prenatal vitamins.
Expected Response: these specially formulated multivitamins are designed to ensure pregnant women get all the extra vitamins and minerals essential for the development of a healthy baby and to meet the increased nutritional needs of mom too. they also benefit women who are trying to become pregnant and new mothers who are breastfeeding. specifically prenatal vitamins deliver a bigger boost of folic acid (between 800 and 1 000 micrograms a day much more than the 400 micrograms a day needed by women of childbearing age) to help prevent neural tube defects and increased iron which helps ward off anemia. they also contain amounts of other vitamins and minerals—including niacin riboflavin thiamin and vitamin c—that may be dangerous. for example vitamins a and d can be harmful when taken in too-large quantities. the rest of us should focus on getting all our nutrients from a rich and varied diet. if you want to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet take a once-daily multivitamin formulated for your age group.

Question: the 4-year-old won't take medicine since we got home from surgery and drank a cup of water. should i take her to the er? . my 3- and 4-year-olds both had their tonsils and adenoids removed yesterday. i am concerned about the possibility of a bacterial infection.
Answer: no. there are no bacterial infections in children. the doctor should have ordered an antibiotic for you.
Expected Response: i have no way of estimating her current level of hydration: --does she have tears? --is the inside of her mouth moist? --is her skin elastic? (pinch a bit of the skin on the back of her hand or tummy pull it up and see if it snaps back). --is she urinating? obviously she needs to drink. and often. did you try popsicles? ice chips? try the little juice box straws. "pay her" in some way for each cup of fluid that she drinks. to make it more interesting pay the 3-year-old too!
================================================================================
Question: since insurance companies can't charge differential pricing wouldn't all fees go up for everyone now?
Answer: that's true. it's true that some people will have to pay higher premiums to get health insurance. but it's also true that you'll pay less for insurance if you buy a plan through the marketplace. the law requires insurers to pay for the cost of coverage. if you don't buy insurance through the marketplaces you'll likely have to make a significant adjustment to your monthly premium. you can find more information on how to do this at healthcare. gov.
Expected Response: that's a great question and one many people are concerned with. first there are a few reasons why insurers can still charge higher rates. they can charge an older person up to 3x that of a younger person they can charge up to 50% more if you smoke and they can take into account where you live because medical care costs vary across the country. however the condition of your health cannot influence your costs. the main concern now is whether enough young healthy people will sign up for health insurance through the marketplaces. if they do the expectation is that the market will even out and prices won't spike. if however only older sicker people sign up costs could rise. we won't know for a while how it all turns out.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe for me to have a 6-hour energy drink if i’m on trazodone depakote and celexa?
Answer: trazadone is a pain medication that can be used to treat pain and other conditions. trazdone is not 100% effective in treating pain. you should talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of trazdal. traxodone is an anti-inflammatory medication that is not a cure for pain. it is not recommended for people with arthritis or other conditions that cause pain. traxsodone may cause side effects such as nausea dizziness or drowsiness. it may also cause side effect if taken with other medications. if you have questions about the safety of traxoderma or trazolone talk to a pharmacist.
Expected Response: without knowing the exact drink that you would like to use it is hard to say whether it would be an issue with the current medications you are taking. you should certainly be careful with energy drinks. they can contain lots of sugars herbals and caffeine. specific products vary so it is important to know the exact ingredients in whatever you’re thinking about taking. in general herbal medications do not work well with the medications you are taking. for the energy you need i would consider replacing energy drinks and supplement usage with sleep exercise and a better diet making sure to take a daily multivitamin as well.

Question: when estimating income for health insurance plans do you use gross income or adjusted gross income?

Question: appendicitis recovery time. inhad a laparoscopic appendectomy in november and i'm still experienceing pain when exercising or stretching out. is this normal?
Answer: hi if you have a lapidoscopic appendage you should be ok then it could be a good idea to see your doctor to see if you can get the treatment you need. good luck
Expected Response: i think what you're experiencing is indeed normal. at least if it's absent other signs or symptoms such as a fever. you don't say if you're experiencing pain at the incision sites or in the area where your appendix used to be. either way it's possible some of this pain is due to the development of scar tissue. scar tissue will form wherever healthy tissue was cut. scar tissue is kind of fibrous and can contract which could give you that pain you're experiencing when you try to stretch. the good news is the pain probably will go away eventually. if it's caused by scar tissue this may relax or break down so it's not so tight. if the pain is caused by general post-surgical tissue inflammation that also should calm down as the tissue fully repairs itself. if you experience a fever or any systemic symptoms you should seek medical attention. but if you're just experiencing minor pain you might give it awhile and see if this improves. if not by all means revisit your doctor. wishing you well!

Question: scoliosis in adults. if u had scoliosis as a child and did exercises to help the curvature of the spine can it effect u later in life as an adult? chronic lower back pain?
Answer: yes it can. it can cause a variety of conditions including arthritis and fibromyalgia.
Expected Response: that depends on the degree and location of the curvature(s). since chronic lower back pain is one of the most common adult complaints it may not be related to adolescent scoliosis at all. most scoliosis curves tend to be higher in the thoracic and upper lumbar area.
================================================================================
Question: at what temperature should an adult take a fever reducer?
Answer: the temperature of a fever is the average of the average number of degrees of fever a person can experience. the average temperature of an adult is about 101. 5 degrees fahrenheit. the temperature that an adult can experience is usually between 101. 6 and 101. 7 degrees fuhrenheit.
Expected Response: fever reducers are taken more to make a person comfortable than to reduce a fever. there is no medical reason for the average person to reduce a fever unless they feel bad and are seeking relief. an adult should take a fever reducer when they feel sick enough to need one.

Question: can precum be released via a handjob? . had intercourse with my girl then pulled out before i could ejaculate in her. as we were foolin around she gave me a hand job and some precum fell onher hand then we decided to go for another round. question is it possible that some precum may have remained in urinary tract? and is it possible that she may get pregnant from it?
Answer: hi as for the handjob you could have had a condom but it could have been a little wet. but if it was just a handfucking then you could be pregnant but do not be fooled by this. good luck
Expected Response: hi ok never heard of condoms? if you masturbated before going to your g/f's and did not urinate then there would still be sperm in your urethra this would then mix with pre-cum and bingo your g/f is pregnant? but that's if the above is correct. if not she could still be pregnant but you will have to wait to see if she miss's her next period but between now and then just think safe sex condoms for now and if she is not pregnant she should think of some kind of bc the pill the ring implant the cap or iud. do hope this helps you. good luck
================================================================================
Question: can taking ramipril and avalide damage my kidneys?
Answer: it's important to know that the amount of damage you're experiencing depends on the type of medication you're taking and how much you're using. the amount that you're getting is not necessarily the amount you're ingesting. you can take a tablet of ibuprofen (the active ingredient in ramiprin) or a tablet that contains zyrtec (the inactive ingredient in the zyrtamax tablet). you can also take a pill that contains levodopa (the same active ingredient as the zirconium). if you're on a prescription medication that contains a lot of drowsiness or other side effects like dizziness or lightheadedness you should talk to your pharmacist to make sure you're not taking too much of these medications.
Expected Response: if you are concerned about your kidneys while taking ramipril and avalide you should talk to your health-care professional. he or she will probably conduct routine blood tests to check your kidney function if there is a concern. we just found out that my husband's kidneys are functioning at only 70% what does this mean. how severe is 70% and what are the treatments for this.

Question: i had my gallbladder removed however still having severe pain underneath right breast area. pathologic diagnosis: gall bladder cholecystectomy - mild chronic cholecystitis cholesterolosis; negative for dysplasia or malignancy. however i am still experiencing the same level of pain than before my surgery. only difference is that i am no longer feeling that "inflated balloon" feeling right before the pain hits. please help to point me in the right direction.
Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor asap its a very good way to go. good luck
Expected Response: so sorry you're experiencing this. a person thinks surgery is going to get rid of the pain and then. nope! one question i would have is: how long ago was your gallbladder surgery? i mean you can experience post-surgical pain in that area for several weeks post-op. if you had the surgery just recently i'd say give it some more time for things to heal inside. if your surgery was some time ago then i would say go back to your doctor. not the surgeon but your primary care provider. tell him or her what's going on. although your gallbladder clearly needed to come out there may be another problem going on that needs to be diagnosed. perhaps your liver is inflamed or something. it's not uncommon for the resolution of one health problem to reveal another. removing your gallbladder may have exposed another health issue that was going undetected because of the gallstone problem. wishing you well!

Question: are there any repellants for bedbugs?
Answer: there are no repellant that will work for bed bugs. you will need to use a home remedy such as a home preservative or insect repellent. bed bugs are a very common nuisance and are not contagious.
Expected Response: there is nothing that you can get or spray that will actually repel or make a bedbug decide to stay away from you. you will be far more sucessful in evading bites however if you understand their weakness. bedbugs can not climb slippery surfaces and heat will kill them. you can take advantage of this by applying a lubricant to the legs of your bed or any surface they might climb to get into your bed. also for this to be effective you will have to make sure that there are no bugs currently in your bed. take your pillows blankets bed linins and anything else that is in your bed and dry them on high heat for 45 min or more. then take apart your bed and use a hot steam gun on every crack crevis anywhere you see black dots or clusters of dots (those are bedbug eggs) deep steam every square inch of your mattress and box spring and make sure you hit the crevices and seams real good. then buy a cover that is rated for bed bugs and seal your mattress in that cover to make sure anything that you might of missed can not get out to bite you. dry your bed linings blankets sheets and pillows every day. alochol can kill bed bugs on contact however it will not kill eggs. ultimately you want to eliminate the bed bugs all together it's a considerable amount of work to do this. if you have a place you can stay for at least 3 weeks you can use vapor strips to kill them. close your windows and seal your vents with plastic open anything that is sealed (plastic totes bags of clothes anything that isin't food in your kitchen). the vapor needs to be able to reach everything. then you want to buy vapor strips called nuvua strips that emit a vapor that fills the house and is toxic to bed bugs. open the strips and distribute them through the rooms in your house (make sure you buy enough for adaquate coverage). make sure your heating or air is turned off as well. anything you take with you to the place your staying must be dried in a dryer for 45 min on high heat so you don't contaminate the new place. other objects that you bring should be kept to a minimum as well. dishes or anything you know for sure is bug free is fine to take with you. when you come back 3 weeks later (3 weeks is to make sure any eggs hatch and are killed by the vapor). open the house to let it air out unseal and turn on your air and you should be bug free. however you will want to at this point take all of your laundry to a laundry mat and at least dry everything for good effect. i dealt with bedbugs for a year and a half and they do require drastic measures to eliminate. you won't be able to just spray something and be done with it. if you don't have a place to stay for 3 weeks you can consult an exterminator. we had to go this option. we had to put all of our belongings in a bedroom the exterminator put the vapor strips in that room and sealed it up with plastic to keep the vapor in. then every week for a month he would come a visit with and spray a chemical all over the furniture and the floors that killed anything that was living there. we had to wash and dry all of our laundry put a cover on our mattress and dry our blankets pillows and bed linings every night. also he put a powder called dichatomaus earth (i may of misspelled that) on all the cracks and corners of our house. this powder actually cuts the shell of the bedbug on contact and they will die. at the end of the month of treatments we were able to open the sealed off room and finally return our lives to normal. total cost was about 800. 00 with the exterminator. if we had went with the strip method it would of been closer to 400 or so. i hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck.

Question: how can malaria be prevented?
Answer: malaria is not prevented by vaccines. however if you have a family history of malaria you can prevent it by getting the vaccine. if you are not sure if you need to get the vaccine you should talk to your doctor. if your doctor doesn't want to vaccinate you may need to wait until you are older to get it.
Expected Response: prevention of malaria involves protecting yourself against mosquito bites and taking antimalarial medicines. but public health officials strongly recommend that young children and pregnant women avoid traveling to areas where malaria is common. the most current information about malaria is available from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the world health organization (who). if you are planning international travel you can learn about the risk of malaria in that geographic area and the medicines recommended to prevent infection by contacting: the cdc at its toll-free phone number (1-800-232-4636) or web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm). your doctor or local health department. prevent mosquito bites to prevent mosquito bites follow these guidelines: limit your outdoor activity between dusk and dawn. stay in screened or air-conditioned rooms. wear protective clothing (long pants and long-sleeved shirts). use insect repellent with deet (n n diethylmetatoluamide). the repellent is available in varying strengths up to 100%. in young children use a preparation containing less than 24% strength because too much of the chemical can be absorbed through the skin. use bed nets (mosquito netting) sprayed with or soaked in an insecticide such as permethrin or deltamethrin. use flying-insect spray indoors around sleeping areas. avoid areas where malaria and mosquitoes are present if you are at higher risk (for example if you are pregnant very young or very old). if you use a bed net treated with insecticide and use insect repellents on your clothes you will reduce your risk of becoming infected with malaria. other steps that may be helpful in reducing the risk of malaria include using air conditioning and electric fans wearing protective clothing using aerosol insecticides in your house and taking certain antimalarial medicines. 3 medicines to prevent malaria the selection of medicines to prevent malaria depends on the geographic region where you may be exposed to malaria and your health condition (such as being pregnant being elderly or young being sick or having immunity or resistance to malaria or having allergies or sensitivity to the medicine). if you are going to a location where malaria is present it is very important to take preventive medicines and to follow the correct schedule for taking them. the majority of people who become infected with malaria do not take preventive malaria medicines or do not follow the correct dosing schedule. medicine to prevent malaria is most effective if you take the recommended dosage exactly as prescribed and for the length of time required. if you are to take the medicine once a week take it on the same day of the week each week. upon returning from an area where malaria is present continue the medicine for the recommended length of time to ensure that all parasites have been eliminated from your body. you will need to take the medicine for 1 to 4 weeks after returning. malaria vaccines scientists are studying malaria vaccines to see whether the vaccines are effectively preventing malaria infection. to date there is no strong evidence that these vaccines are effective. 4 3 work continues on improving vaccines for preventing malaria. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: i am a 57 yr old woman. is there anything wrong with getting up to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night?
Answer: hi this may be a good thing for you to do but if you are a woman then this is a good time to go. good luck
Expected Response: most adults shouldn’t have to get up more than once a night to urinate. having to get up 2 or 3 times is likely causing you to lose a lot of sleep. for a woman who has already gone through menopause the most common causes of frequent nighttime urination include diabetes and bladder infections. diabetes is often silent and frequent urination may be the only sign that the blood sugar is too high. with a bladder infection you might have other symptoms such as urgency and discomfort. there are also many other possible causes of nightly bathroom trips. it may be as simple as drinking too much fluid in the evening. overactive bladder is another common cause. medicines such as water pills may make you run to the bathroom even if they were taken many hours before. caffeine and alcohol can also cause frequent urination. for some women it may just be force of habit. very rarely it can be the sign of a tumor in the bladder or pelvis. see your doctor and have a checkup. make sure you mention how many times a night you have to go to the bathroom. he or she will likely get a urine test and some lab work to sort things out. then you will finally be able to get a good night’s sleep.

Question: what is boniva injection?
Answer: boniva injections are not an effective treatment for a variety of conditions. they are usually used to treat a variety conditions such as a bacterial infection or a viral infection.
Expected Response: boniva injection is a prescription medicine used to treat osteoporosis in women after menopause. ). boniva injection may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most women who receive the injection even though they won't be able to see or feel a difference. boniva injection may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). these effects continue as long as you receive boniva injection. it is important that you receive your boniva injection every three months for as long as your health care provider prescribes it. boniva injection can treat your osteoporosis only if you continue to receive treatment.
================================================================================
Question: are anti-wrinkle products sold over-the-counter effective?
Answer: anti-inflammatory products are not effective in treating wrinkles. they are usually used for a few weeks to a month to treat the condition.
Expected Response: yes some anti-wrinkle products sold over the counter are effective. the ingredients that make your skin look more beautiful can be expensive but they don't have to be. look for products that contain antioxidant vitamins a (retinol) c and e; scientifically and clinically these antioxidants help stop free-radical damage that leads to fine lines and wrinkles. also ingredients such as matrixyl 3000 a peptide contribute to the production of collagen and elastin. they can plump up the skin matrix and actually make the skin visibly look younger. other ingredients such as licorice extract and niacin can help fight age spots that lead to uneven skin tone. the problem is finding the products that have the above ingredients in the right concentration to produce results. the longstanding results are definitely noticeable. it typically takes at least two to four weeks before you begin to see results so remember to wear sunscreen and start now!

Question: what causes parkinsons disease?
Answer: parkinson disease is caused by the fungus called parkinson's disease. it is not caused by any other disease but it can be caused by a variety of conditions. it can also be caused from a variety other causes including: high blood pressure. high cholesterol. high blood sugar. high triglycerides. high levels of certain other factors. high thyroid hormone. high high cholesterol high blood cholesterol high triglyceride high cholesterol and high levels in certain other areas of the body. high immune system. high aortic aneurysm. high low testosterone. high bp. high c-reactive protein (CRp) levels. high d-glucan levels. low bp blood pressure and high a-lactate levels. and many other conditions. parkinsonism is a genetic disorder in which the disease of the parkinson family is inherited.
Expected Response: low levels of dopamine a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) involved in controlling movement cause symptoms of parkinson's disease. the shortage of this brain chemical occurs when nerve cells in a part of the brain (substantia nigra) that produces dopamine fail and deteriorate. the exact cause of this deterioration is not known. the links between parkinson's disease and factors such as genetics aging toxins in the environment and free radicals are all under investigation. although these studies are beginning to provide some answers experts do not know the exact cause of the disease. studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a genetic cause of parkinson's disease. only a small percentage of people with parkinson's disease have a parent brother or sister who has the disease; however abnormal genes do seem to be a factor in a few families where early-onset parkinson's disease is common. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: i'm on the pill sexually active i have missed a few pills but now i've had some spotting and pink discharge for two days. could i be pregnant. i've missed a pill before but never had this kind of symptoms ever now i'm worried i could be pregnant. i am taking cilest pills which i've been on for around 4 years. i'm on a daily dose of the pill and i don't have any symptoms. i have been on the placebo for about 3 years now and i'm not sure if i'm pregnant or not. i want to know if i could get pregnant but i don’t want to take any chances.
Answer: hi your find that it takes 3 to 4 days for your body to get used to taking the pill. so if you are having unprotected sex then you are not pregnant. but if you have had unprotected sex and have had a period then you could be. just take a pregnancy test and it will show. good luck
Expected Response: hi if this spotting is around day 21 of your 28 day cycle then yes it could be a sign of being pregnant. remember day 1 is the first day of this cycle work it from there. so why are you on the bc pill then? what you have done is just playing with fire and this time you could have be burnt. good luck

Question: two periods. or one long one. have 20 ys old daughter living with me plus my 11 yr old would that mess mine up? . started period and thought it stopped but yet was spotting lightly. hubby came home we had sex and i started started my period again. does having our 20 yr old daughter living with us now which claims she is not having her period for three months now. would that effect me? plus my 11 yr old is so hormonal lately. she has not started her first period yet. does that matter?
Answer: hi well it is a bit like a couple of weeks ago your find out that your pregnant and its a bit hard to get pregnant. but that is the way it is. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: while some women claim that other female family members or women living in the same house will tend to "cycle" there is little evidence to support this. don't blame your 20 year old or your hormonal 11 year old for this episode. these things just happen. menstrual cycles have this annoying habit of being wacky from time to time and they tend to straighten out on their own. if not you may need to see a gyn but right now you can probably just "wait and see". i am more concerned with your 20 year old daughter's three month period assuming she is not over-exaggerating. maybe she is the one that needs to see a gyn. yes i agree my 20 yr old should see a gyn but she doesn't want to. she was pregnant early this year but says she miscarrried by her boyfriend hitting her in tummy. as for my 11 yr old. i hope when she finally starts her first period it will make her normal again. lol. she snapped at me and she never done that before. she says she hates me but then she loves me not use to the hormones. miss my little girl. as for my spotting never ending period or two time period not to worry. it is normal?

Question: what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Answer: you can get rh- sensitization from the same thing that causes rh sensitizations. the immune system responds by blocking the rh factor that causes the rh sensitizing response. if you are allergic to rh-containing products you may also get rh exposure from a combination of rh- and rh-resistant bacteria. rh exposure can also be caused by a combination or combination of the two. if your doctor or health care provider recommends rh- or rh-resistant products you should talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits of rh exposure. if rh exposure is associated with a higher risk for developing rh-related diseases or other health conditions you should discuss this with your doctor.
Expected Response: if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant? . we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i don't want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i don't want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he doesn't quit as well. i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker. he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do!
Answer: hi if you think your husband is smoking then just tell him to stop smoking then he will know. good luck
Expected Response: i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking! i am a father of a recently born child i was told by the wife and quote if you want to smoke do it outside and so i took my 7 yr old smoking chair and headed for the door she has been a happy woman since. and also i learned 1 thing from it. it is so much more easier to change my bad habits when i know she carried my son for 9 months and still cooked and cleaned. . and every bad habit i have could potentially put my son's health at risk! p. s. tell him to stop being lazy and take his butt outside to smoke his baby cant defend itself!

Question: how is income used to calculate subsidy eligibility in the health insurance exchanges?
Answer: income is the amount of money that a person earns to pay for health insurance. it is a number that is often used to determine the amount that a family can expect to pay in premiums and deductibles.
Expected Response: the formula to find out if you qualify for a subsidy on the health insurance exchanges seems complicated but it is actually quite simple. let’s walk through it. the subsidy calculation is based on your income and the average cost of certain health plans on the exchange. subsidies are only available to those who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (fpl). in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. the amount of subsidy you receive depends upon where your income falls between the 100% and 400% fpl range. for example if your income is 100% fpl you are only responsible for the amount of monthly premiums that equals 2% of your income. anything above that dollar amount is considered your subsidy. below is the chart from 100-400% fpl of how much of your income you will have to pay towards your monthly premiums on the exchange. these percentages of income are not your subsidy; they are your contribution. the subsidy is calculated per individual or family based upon the dollar amount that goes over this contribution. income amount of income responsible for in premiums 100-133% fpl 2% of income 133-150% fpl 3 – 4% of income 150-200% fpl 4 – 6. 3% of income 200-250% fpl 6. 3 – 8. 05% of income 250-300% fpl 8. 05 – 9. 5% of income 300-400% fpl 9. 5% of income also beginning on january 1 2015 if your employer offers health insurance but your portion of the monthly premiums in your employer-based plan cost 9. 5% or more of your income you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange.

Question: how to get off suboxone subliginal strips without withdrawl. i take 1-3 8mg suboxone strips a day. ive been taking them for a little over a year and was looking for the best way to get off them. i'm not sure if i should take them or not. i have been taking the suboxones for a year now and i am not sure what to do. i am very stressed out and have been feeling sick for a while now.
Answer: hi just google natural ways out of depression and anxiety and how to get rid of it you find lots of info there just google it its a lot of help and some help from the doctors its a whole lot of info. good luck
Expected Response: my best advice to speak to your healthcare provider -- the one that prescribes the strips to you. he or she can help you transition off the suboxone. if on the other hand you mean you obtain the strips illicitly and now want to stop using them then i advise you seek addiction counseling. sure you can taper off the suboxone dose on your own successfully but you need to address the underlying reasons why you began using suboxone to begin with. any addiction involves 'environmental' and emotional factors as well as the actual physical addiction. suboxone addiction is becoming a real problem. if this is the situation with you i'm sorry you've found yourself in this predicament. but there is help available. i commend you for getting off this substance. there is no shame in seeking help. wishing you well! the best way the only one that works is to gradually reduce the dose around -25% every 10 days never make a sudden stop or you will feel all the terrible effect of withdrawal! you can read in details the "taper technique" here : <link> good luck and keep in mind : even if you feel well continue to reduce the dose gradually takes you time

Expected Response: you should speak to your doctor before getting a flu shot just to be safe. he or she will tell you for sure whether or not to get one. in general it is recommended that people at high risk for complications from the flu (such as those with compromised immune systems) receive the flu vaccine. you cannot get the flu from the vaccine and it's very important people in high risk groups receive this potentially life-saving vaccination. i can tell you that all of the people around you -- family members who live with you or visit regularly caregivers other people you come into contact with on a regular basis -- definitely should get a flu shot. this is to protect you from getting the flu from them. this is very important in your situation so please urge your loved ones to get vaccinated. i wish you all the best!

Question: if caught early can i take steps to prevent bedbugs from multiplying?
Answer: bedbugs are not the only problem with bed bugs. they are also quite common in areas where you live. bedbugs can be attracted to the surface of the skin and can live in areas that are not covered by a bedding material like a blanket or rug. bedbug infestations can occur anywhere in the body and can be very hard to control. bed bugs can also be attracted by other insects such as insects that live in the moist moist areas of the body. bed bug infestation in the fall may be caused by a dry environment. bedbabies are not attracted to bedbugs because they are not as big as adults. bed bums are very hard and can easily be broken open. bed insects can also live in very moist areas and can spread through the skin. bed insect infestions are very common in the winter and fall. bedworm infestants are most common in winter.
Expected Response: no. although you may be able to spot and kill a bed bug or two that doesn’t get at the root problem which is the infestation itself. professionals consider bedbugs the single most difficult pest to eliminate. it’s not a do-it-yourself pest.

Question: what type of anesthetic is used in a cystoscope procedure. i am scheduled to have a cystoscope next month. what type of anesthetic do they use for the procedure and how is it adminestered? . . . . thanks
Answer: a cysticoscope is a procedure that involves a series of small incisions in the cystoscopy tube. these incisions are usually made of plastic. the cysticoscopy is usually done in a surgical setting. the procedure is usually performed by a surgeon who specializes in cystic fibrosis. you may be able to get a cycoscope in a few weeks. you can get a surgical cystotomy in a couple of weeks.
Expected Response: urologists are like chefs. they all "cook" a bit differently. they only thing i can do is try and guess what they may use. if the cystoscopic exam is being done in the office they may only use a topical (lidocaine jelly) inserted in the urethra. if you are going to a surgical center you could either be given an injection of versed for "conscious sedation" or even be put under a more general anesthesia. since i don't know your urologist the reason for the exam or even if you are male or female it would be impossible for me to know exactly what they may or may not use. the best way to find that answer is to call the urologist office and ask. they will tell you.

Question: can lisinopril mix with cialis and cializine. i am taking cialisfin for my bipolar disorder. i have a lot of anxiety and depression. i was prescribed cialisk for my anxiety. i took it for anxiety and anxiety symptoms. i had to take it for a while. it was very bad for me. i felt like i was in a dream. i started to feel like i could not sleep. i tried to sleep but it was not working. i went to the doctor and he said that it was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. i did not take it. i still feel like this is a bad thing. i also have anxiety.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a lot more than just anxiety. you're also dealing with depression. you need to take your anxiety medication and get it checked out. it's not a good idea to take a medication that's been prescribed
Expected Response: this is a good question for your doctor. please don't be embarrassed to ask. any health care professional would be glad you asked before combining these two particular medications. drugs like cialis which are used to treat erectile dysfunction can affect a person's blood pressure. lisinopril is a medication designed to help lower blood pressure. therefore combining these two medications could have unintended consequences. i suggest you speak to your health care provider about taking cialis while you're also taking lisinopril. it may be fine but only your doctor can tell you for sure. wishing you well!

Question: does anyone out there know what sweets syndrome is?
Answer: there are many types of sweets. the most common type is called "sweet" or "bad" and the most commonly known is "bad". it is not a disease but rather a symptom of a food allergy. it is a symptom that can be caused by a variety of foods including dairy products and certain foods that are not naturally sweet.
Expected Response: most helpful answer sweet's syndrome (also called sweet syndrome and known medically as "acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis") is a rare skin condition in which a painful bluish-red rash appears usually on just one side of the body along with a fever. most of the time sweet's appears on its own with no known cause. about 2 out of 10 cases may be related to a serious underlying disorder like cancer. the rash of sweet syndrome evolves in a very predictable fashion. it usually starts on the arms back neck or face. the initial bumps are small and red and occur after a fever or upper respiratory infection. this rash quickly grows into clusters of bumps that may measure an inch in diameter. the bumps almost always are painful and may develop blisters. these lesions may clear up on their own but it can take months for this to happen. if you develop this type of rash after a fever or upper respiratory infection you'd be well-advised to consult a doctor. with appropriate treatment the rash of sweet syndrome may clear up within days. i hope this answers your question!

Question: can shrimp and french fries cooked in the same greese cause allergic reaction. hi at the age of 40 i developed an allergie to peanuts and shellfish at the same time. i had the test run they came back negative. so i went to red lobster and two hours later was rushed to the hospital with a shellfish allergie. two weeks later bought a snickers out of a vending machine back to the er. i was treated for it and it was cured. i have been on the same diet for over a year now. i am still having severe allergic reactions to peanuts but i have not had any problems with them. i think i will be ok. good luck ps if i have a shellfry it is not the same as the one i had in the er but i did have a reaction to the shellfish.
Answer: hi if your not allergic to shellfish then you should be ok but try this its a very simple way of curing the problem. just mix the
Expected Response: yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in cross-contamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil. cross-contamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are re-used without cleaning. when eating out at restaurants it’s important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiter/waitress so that the cook/chef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food. even if you don’t think that the food that you’re ordering contains any of your allergens it’s better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents. it will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no cross-contamination. i would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods. in the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an epipen so that you’re able to stop allergic reactions fast any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. best advice: if you're allergic to shellfish never eat somewhere that serves it. lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in snickers. stay far away from things you're allergic to and talk to your doctor about an epi-pen.

Question: what is r/o encephalopathy. i know that encephalopathy is a brain disease but i need more information please.
Answer: encephalitis is a very common and very serious brain disease. it can be caused by many different things. it is a neurological disease.
Expected Response: i'm thinking you saw this on an order for a test. r/o is medical shorthand for "rule out. " it's a commonly used abbreviation to state why the health care provider is ordering the test. in this case the test was done to rule out encephalopathy. for those who may be reading this and don't know what encephalopathy is it's a condition in which the brain suffers damage or problems from poisons that haven't been adequately filtered from the bloodstream by the liver. encephalopathy is one possible complication of cirrhosis of the liver. i wish you all the best.

Question: is there a chance of me being pregnant? . me and my partner had unprotected sex and he finished in me but 2 days i got my period. after my period we had sex again and it happened again. so i'm not sure if i am. can you help me?
Answer: hi if you have had unprotected intercourse with your partner and he has not had a period then you may be pregnant but you need to wait till after you have your period. but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: no. i can't really help you. you are having unprotected sex so it is really only a matter of time before you may become pregnant. granted you are having sex at a time when ovulation is not expected but sperm can remain viable for a week or more in the nurturing environment of the female reproductive tract. if you want to get pregnant then keep having random unprotected sex. if you desire to prevent or delay pregnancy use some effective contraception and you won't always be stressing out over this ever-present possibility.

Answer: i don't know. i don’t know what you have or what your age is. i would suggest you call your doctor to see if he or she can give you a prescription for vingabone. it may be a very good idea to take this medication in a day or two after you get home.
Expected Response: maybe. this is a common home remedy that may help for some minor itching but that depends on the cause. antihistamines are the most commonly-prescribed anti-itch treatments (benadryl claritin zyrtec etc. )

Answer: hi yes you could get pregnant from this but you could just wait and see if you get your period again but you do need to take a test to see if your getting your period back. good luck
Expected Response: hi so you know how this all works? having unprotected sex saturday night wont make you pregnant by sunday sorry but that's a fact. if you know how it works you will know that the first day of your cycle is day! so around day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day but you need to have unprotected sex say 3 to 4 days before that? why well it takes 3 days for sperm to get in place to receive your egg so if around day 21 you get some spotting this could be a sign your on your way to getting pregnant so if you miss your next period and wait a week your then go get tested or do an hpt. so now do you see? good luck

Question: why would a 13 yr old athletic male have a slow heart rate? . i am a 14 yr old male. my heart rate is 140 beats per minute. i have been told by my doctor that my heart is not responding to the usual heart rate. i am also experiencing a lot of pain in my lower right side. i feel like i'm going to die. i'm not sure what to do.
Answer: hi if your reading this its not a problem at all it is just a problem with your heart. good luck
Expected Response: there may be two reasons: one reason would be that he is in great shape. runners tend to have slower heart rates (50-60 bpm) so if he is a runner in good shape this could account for a slower and stronger heart rate. unfortunately another reason could be a hidden cardiac problem. i don't know how slow his heart rate is or if his heart rate is regular skipping beats etc so it would be wise for him to have a sports clearance by his medical provider or even a cardiologist. this would be for your son's own protection.

Expected Response: what does your doctor say? did he give you any answers maybe ask the pharmacist. he may suggest something over the counter. are you drinking plenty of water? if the medicines you are taking make your throat dry you will need water to replenish what you are losing from the pneumonia. i have had walking pneumonia plenty of times and my doctor put me on amoxicillin and told me to drink plenty of water. if your cough is bringing up stuff from your lungs that's a good thing but if it's dry you need water.

Expected Response: no single factor is known to cause lupus. research suggests that a combination of genetic hormonal and immune system factors may be behind it. a predisposition to developing the disease appears to be inherited. environmental factors ranging from viral and bacterial infections to severe emotional stress or overexposure to sunlight may play a role in provoking or triggering the disease. certain drugs such as the blood pressure drug hydralazine and the heart rhythm drug procainamide may cause lupus-like symptoms. high estrogen levels resulting from pregnancy estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives may aggravate lupus.

Question: i think i may have shingles symptoms started yesterday i work in an er am i putting my patient's at risk? . symptoms include severe pain along the rib cage on one side today noticed a red painful spot no drainage. i have a rash on my left side. it is a red rash with a small white spot on the inside. the rash has a redish tint to it and it is very painful.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. i am sure you are experiencing shingled symptoms. there are many different types of shingling. it could be a viral infection or an allergic reaction. there is no way to tell for sure until you see a medical provider. i suggest you see your primary care provider for an examination. you may need to see a dermatologist to get a better idea of what is causing your symptoms.
Expected Response: shingles is contagious so there is the potential that you could pass the virus to one of your patients particularly babies and children or adults who have not either had the chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. as long as you have new blisters appearing you are contagious. you should likely avoid contact with patients during this time as it will be difficult to know if they're immune. once all the blisters have crusted over and no new ones are forming you are no longer contagious and can return to normal work duties. you can ask your doctor about antiviral medicines for shingles as that may help shorten the duration so that you can safely return to work sooner.

Answer: hi if you have had a miscarriage your doctor may be able to tell you if you are pregnant or not. but your best bet is to have a test done at your doctor's office. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it.

Answer: niacins are a combination of peptides that are found in foods and other foods. niacs are also found in certain types of milk and yogurt.

Question: will hot baths permanently damage sperm?
Answer: hi well this is from the uk’s nhs you can google it just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas.

Question: is it safe to take adderall citalopram klonopin and grifulvin together?
Answer: i am not sure if you are aware that addingerall (clindamycin) is a diuretic. it is a combination of two medications that is used to treat the common cold. it can be taken together for a mild fever or for a severe cough.
Expected Response: this combination of medications does not have any drug interactions. however i would take the grifulvin with food to minimize the stomach irritation and with a fatty substance like milk or yogurt. a fatty substance will help to increase the absorption of the medication to effectively treat the condition. do not skip any doses and you may have to complete therapy for 6 weeks in order to eradicate the condition.

Question: triple bypass completed 7 months ago need my brother be concerned about exercise increasing my heart rate above 110? . quit smoking before surgery and have lost weight he is 58 and walking every night for 40 minutes and climbing 50 stairs and a hill up and down. he feels fine and does not feel it necessary to stop but someone told him he shouldn't even be mowing a lawn because he has heart disease. he is also having a lot of trouble sleeping and he is not getting enough sleep. he has been taking ibuprofen and it is making him feel tired.
Answer: hi you need to see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: i'm glad to hear your brother has quit smoking and is doing so well post-surgery. that is fantastic! exercising after coronary artery bypass surgery is a good way to keep the heart healthy. that said your brother should consult his surgeon for details concerning how much he should be exercising. it's possible he's doing too much. and then again it's possible his doctor wants him doing more than he is. a simple phone call to his surgeon's office will get him the information he needs to keep his ticker in tip-top shape. every heart patient is different and the post-surgery exercise program is unique to the individual. i'm sure the person who told him not to mow the lawn was well-meaning but it's best to get medical advice from a medical professional. wishing your brother well!

Question: is it safe to take take raspberry ketones and saint john's wort together?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's important to understand that there are no safe and effective ways to take your medications together. you may want to consider using a different medication to treat your symptoms. i suggest you discuss this with your pharmacist before starting any new medication. if you're not sure what you're taking you can consult a pharmacist to help you determine what's best for you. i hope you feel better soon!
Expected Response: yes it probably is safe. that said i want to add if you're taking raspberry ketones for weight loss you need to know there is absolutely no scientific evidence (studies) to support the claim that raspberry ketones cause weight reduction in adults. because raspberry ketones aren't well-studied in humans it's impossible to say for certain if the product will negatively interact with st. john's wort. also be sure to read the raspberry ketones label carefully to determine whether or not the supplement contains any other active ingredients. hope this helps!

Question: what should my bedtime be for a good night’s sleep?
Answer: if you have a bedtime of at least 12 hours you should have a good sleep. if you are sleeping in a bed that is not covered by a blanket you may want to consider using a pillow. if your bedtime is around 12 hours then you should be able to sleep at least a little longer. if it is a bed you can sleep with a pillow but if you sleep on a mattress that is covered by an over-the-counter mattress pad you may not be able sleep at all.
Expected Response: i have a formula that people can use. the formula is basically this: take a 90 minute segment and count back five 90 minute segments from when your scheduled wake up time is and that should probably be about when you should go to bed. pick your wakeup time. so let’s say it’s 7:00 am. then we know the average sleep cycle is somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes so you want to count and we know you need about 5 of those. so count backwards for 5 ninety minutes segments from 7:00 am and you’d get i believe it’s 11:30 okay. that’s how you can really tell if you’re refreshed or sleep deprived things of that nature because if you’re not getting that individualized sleep number as it were that’s when you’re going to feel it. there is a myth going on out there that we all need eight hours of sleep and i’m here to tell you that’s absolutely not true. there is no perfect sleep number out there for everyone. everyone’s number is a bit individualized and so what we’ve learned from the data basically is when you wake up and feel refreshed look back and see how many of hours of sleep you got and that’s probably your sleep number.

Question: what kind of food can i eat after a vires. three people in my home had a verse 24 hour stomach. now two days has pass. what can we eat?
Answer: it is best to eat a whole food after a meal. this is a great way to get rid of a stomach bug. i suggest you try a variety of foods that are low in calories and are low-fat (no added sugar) and low in fat (no cholesterol).
Expected Response: you can basically eat anything you want -- your normal diet (whatever that might be). your body will respond if this "stomach virus" is still rearing its ugly head. for instance if you get nausea or diarrhea (again? ) you may have to eat a bit more reasonably for a few more days. viral infections last about a week but most people feel better on day four.

Question: i ejaculation in 2-3 mins is it normal? please advice some useful tips n med if nessesary. i am getting married soon and i found when i masturbate i become excited to much and cum in no time please tell me how to increase time for intercourse? exercise medicine diet all guide will be appreciated.
Answer: hi if you google natural ways out of masturbation then you will find lots of info on natural ways to get rid of masturbation. but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: first it’s good to be concerned and thoughtful about how you will please your partner – just don’t get too worried about it; approaching it with relaxation and ease is more productive for you. second try practicing edging for a couple of weeks. edging involves masturbating right up until the point of ejaculating then stopping before the ejaculation occurs; letting the urge to ejaculate subside; then masturbating to the edge again; and repeating this over and over without ejaculating for as long as you can – at least half an hour. doing this every day for 2-3 weeks helps many men learn control over their ejaculations when with a partner. it also gives them a sore red penis but using a quality penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) that includes both vitamin e (a natural hydrator) and she abutter (an excellent emollient) can help reduce the soreness.

Question: i have a single round bump on my forehead what could it be? . it looks kind of scaly. i have a really oily forehead i dont know if that could be affecting it. i tried "popping" it once. it only bleeds no pus at all. its been there for some time possibly months. it doesnt hurt or bother me other than aesthetically. i can even apply pressure to it and it will "flatten" for a bit. but it will eventually return to its round shape. i have absolutely no idea what it could be and its rather embarrassing. any ideas tips on how to get rid of it?

Expected Response: as much as i would like to help you it is not possible to blindly make a diagnosis over the internet. a medical provider would need to see and feel this lump in order to make an accurate determination. and without a accurate diagnosis it would not be possible to suggest treatments. a few suggestions: first stop messing with it. this could be a deep cyst (sebaceous cyst or cystic acne). by squeezing it you may make it worse or cause an infection. second either see your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist so that you can have an accurate diagnosis. i can't imagine this lesion cannot be treated but you need that all-important diagnosis first.

Question: is it possible to have a false negative blood test for celiac disease?
Answer: yes. if you are diagnosed with celiac or gluten intolerance you are at a higher risk for developing a false positive test. it is also important to note that the test is not a diagnostic test. a false test is a false-positive test.
Expected Response: yes it is possible. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (blood tests for diagnosing celiac disease) are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a higher rate of false positive tests. there are two recognized reasons for false negative blood tests for celiac disease: patients with deficiency of one type of antibody iga (they are born that way) will have low endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies since they are iga-type antibodies. patients who have self-treated themselves with a gluten-free diet for weeks to months before having these tests done can have abnormal blood tests revert to normal.

Question: i frequenly get blood vesels breaking in my eye causing white area to be bright red what is the cause? . it starts with what looks like a pin hole gets worse and can last over a week. the blood is very red and very red. the doctor said it was a blood clot. i have no idea what it is but it is very hard to see. i am wondering if there is any other cause for the redness?
Answer: i have a very interesting story. i had an eye infection in the early 2000s and it was caused by an eye fungus. i was treated with a steroid cream and it worked. my doctor gave me a prescription for a prescription eye cream called metronidazole. i took it and it lasted for about a week and it started to clear up. i went to the doctor and he said it wasn't a blood vessel but a cyst. i didn't have a cystic eye and it cleared up without me having
Expected Response: these innocent little red areas are called subconjunctival hemorrhages. they are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels. they appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see. if these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed. blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be straining. straining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement. i saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages. she had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior! people who take aspirin or other blood-thinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages. if you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider.

Question: why isn't a sunscreen that is below an spf 15 very effective?
Answer: sunscreen is not an effective sunscreen. it is a product that is designed to protect against the sun's rays. there are many different types of sunscreen and some are effective. some are more expensive and may be more expensive than others. some contain more ingredients than others and some contain less.
Expected Response: an spf 15 blocks about 93% that means 7% of the sun's rays are still getting through to your skin. and that if you are using enough product which nobody ever does. so chances are if you are using an spf 15 the way that most people use it you are probably only getting an spf 8 out of it. so the higher spf the better. using plenty of product applying it liberally or generously will really help you as well and going to the lower end products you are really just not getting enough protection.

Question: why does sugar make me tired? i can have 1 piece of hard candy and 5min. later i get so sleepy. i'm not diabetic. can i change how my body processes sugar?
Answer: sugar is a chemical in the body that is produced by the cells of the pancreas. it is produced in the liver and is produced when the pancresor cells produce sugar. the pancremes produce sugar when the body produces sugar. in the case of sugar the body is able to produce sugar by burning it. in addition the body makes sugar by converting it to glucose which is a sugar molecule. the body then converts sugar to glucose by converting the sugar molecule to a sugar substance called a glucose-dense substance called an endocannabinoid (endocannabinoids) substance. the endocannoids are a group of chemicals that are responsible for the production of sugar in the blood. when sugar is produced the body's production of sugars is slowed down. this means that
Expected Response: the body absorbs sugar quickly. that's why people can get a "sugar high" and then crash. you probably just absorb it more quickly than others. instead of trying to get your body to accept sugar why don't you eat more foods that are more likely to give you energy like nuts?

Answer: hi if you have high bp then you could have a heart attack. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer some people do experience vertigo and lightheadedness when taking bp meds. it happens a lot when going from laying to standing or sitting to standing. i recommend getting in these positions slowly and standing still for a few seconds before walking. these symptoms can also mean that your bp is dropping too low. if it continues and happens at other times besides just changing positions call your doctor. your meds may need to be lowered a bit or switched to something else.

Question: how does arthroscopic surgery help osteoarthritis?
Answer: arthroscope surgery is a surgical procedure that involves removing the bone in the spine and using a device called a tricorder to remove the bone. the procedure is usually performed on a small number of patients with osteoarthroscopy. it is not recommended that you use a tricocele or other cosmetic surgery to remove bone.
Expected Response: before going to knee replacement surgery your doctor may recommend arthroscopy. a surgeon will insert a thin scope through a small incision to view the inside of your knee. damaged knee cartilage can be removed (called debridement) and the knee can be cleaned or flushed (lavage or irrigation) to remove loose bone or cartilage pieces that may be causing pain. arthroscopy may provide temporary relief from pain or delay the need for more invasive surgery.

Question: what other medical conditions cause high blood pressure? . i am 66 years old female and do not take any medications. i am not overweight. i workout 1 hour 3 days a week. i do not have a family history of high blood presure. i do not smoke or drink. i eat healthy meals and do not overuse salt. i am not under stress. up until this year my bp was 100/60 now it ranges from 100/60 to 140/90. what other medical conditions can cause bp problems?
Answer: hi i think you need to do a blood test for your bp. it will tell you if you are at high risk for high blood sugar. good luck
Expected Response: well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the "hypertension threshold " but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise -- that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called "essential hypertension. " although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us.

Question: i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure. is this linked to menopause?
Answer: hi if you read up about menopatrol you should have seen your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging.

Expected Response: well no that's certainly not a normal reaction to receiving a flu shot. however it's possible the two events are unrelated. regardless if the numbness and twitching don't clear up on their own after a few days this is worth getting checked out by a medical professional. a number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. a health care provider can diagnose the problem and get you appropriate treatment. you might consider putting in a call to your primary health care provider for an appointment now because you can always cancel it later if the symptoms go away. unless you're exhibiting signs of a stroke (which would not include muscle twitches) this probably isn't an emergency situation. hope this helps!

Expected Response: what makes this a particularly unique time in antibiotic resistance is that the pace of development of resistance is really outstripping the development of new drugs. in the past we knew there were new drugs coming on the market -- every year we had something new. now we've reached a situation where that's not the case year to year. for some [germs] that we see a resistance to in hospitals there's nothing coming anytime soon. we're facing a situation now where people are talking about the unavailability of antibiotics to treat common infections.

Expected Response: you can't diagnose an illness based on vague symptoms alone but your symptoms are troubling. brownish or yellow eyes could mean jaundice (hepatitis) or other liver problems. throwing up blood can be a very serious sign. it would be in your best interest to see a medical provider as soon as possible.

Question: what's the best over-the-counter treatment for an upset stomach?
Answer: the best treatment for a upset stomach is to have it checked out by a doctor. if you have a stomach infection you may want to see your doctor right away if you are experiencing any of these symptoms: a sudden increase in your stomach pain or discomfort in your lower abdomen or abdomen. a sudden change in your appetite or decrease in appetite. a change in the amount of stool you eat. a drop in your blood sugar levels. a decrease in your pulse. a loss of appetite. or a change of appetite in the stomach. if your doctor suspects an upset abdomen you can call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away.
Expected Response: this is a question that a pharmacist is going to ask that patient a lot of other questions. i need to know who has the upset stomach. and for how long have they had this upset stomach? this could be some occasional heartburn it could be though something much more serious. sometimes upset stomachs can also lead to things like viral infections. so we may not want to necessarily treat it. we want to find out if this is an elderly patient may be they've had it for a long time and there is another medication that could be causing this upset stomach as well. so we are going to have to find a little bit more information. so things like telling us what medications you are taking? are you taking any over-the-counter or herbals because they have a possibility of possibly causing an upset stomach as well finding out if you are running a fever. all these little questions that we are going to ask you are probably going to help us help you better.

Expected Response: everyone's at risk but those at greater risk are infants young children pregnant women and their unborn babies older adults and people with weakened immune systems (for example those with hiv/aids cancer diabetes kidney disease and transplant patients). some people may become ill after ingesting only a few harmful bacteria. others may remain symptom-free after ingesting thousands. to prevent food-borne illness keep these key actions in mind: wash your hands. keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods -- like salads -- separated during preparation. cook foods to the proper temperature by using a food thermometer. refrigerate foods promptly and reheat leftovers to 165 degrees fahrenheit.

Question: being that royal icing is made with raw egg whites is it safe to eat?
Answer: it is not safe to take raw eggs from a child. eggs are not the same as raw eggs. raw eggs are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria.
Expected Response: assuming the eggs are from a reliable and safe source free of salmonella i guess you can say it would be safe. however since there was a recent recall of millions of eggs (due to contamination) you and your guests will always be taking a chance since we never really know when a contamination takes place until we get sick with terrible diarrhea.

Question: how do you diagnose hashimoto's hypothyroidism and does this condition have effect on heart disease and osteoporosis?
Answer: the thyroid gland is a vital organ that controls our metabolism and our ability to produce and deliver nutrients. it is responsible for the production of thyroid hormones that help us feel full and feel full. the thyroid is located in the middle of the back of the head and is located at the base of the spine. the lower part of the thyroid contains the thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) which is responsible specifically for the release of thyroid hormone. the other part of our body is the pituitary gland which is located on the top of the neck and is responsible primarily for producing iron and vitamin d. the pituary gland is located below the rib cage and is the source of the blood for the bones. the ovaries are located on top of our back. the pancreas is located behind the ribcage and is also responsible for producing insulin.
Expected Response: hashimoto's thyroiditis can be diagnosed by biopsy. however clinical history along with a blood test confirming hypothyroidism plus the addition of anti-tpo antibodies and a thyroid scan (if needed) also secures the diagnosis in most cases. treatment involves starting thyroid hormone replacement (synthroid levoxyl) to maintain a thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level within the normal range. if the thyroid is large enough to cause symptoms of compression (difficultly swallowing hoarseness wheezing) surgery to debunk or remove the gland may be considered if the gland dose not shrink on replacement therapy. in regard to your question about heart disease the relationship is more related to replacement therapy of the thyroid hormones than with hashimoto's itself. as the gland starts to lose function hypothyroidism can result. hypothyroidism is treated by replacing the inappropriately low or absent endogenous thyroid hormone with a synthetic equivalent taken daily by mouth (synthroid or levoxyl for example). should a patient receive too much thyroid hormone the high dose can result in palpitations irregular heartbeat and over time a weakened heart. it can also result in osteoporosis. if the hormone is under-replaced it can exacerbate heart failure adversely affect cholesterol levels and slow heart rates down. naturally if hashimoto's resulting in hypothyroidism remains unreplaced completely this can also occur.

Expected Response: the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed.

Question: psychological or physiological? every time i eat eggs i get a stomach ache. if the eggs are baked in cookies cakes even meringue i am fine. but if they are just fried or scrambled baked in a quiche or in an omelet my stomach gets super acidic later and i feel nauseous. unable to move for hours. i've had this for as long as i can remember and everyone keeps telling me its psychological but i want to eat eggs they look delicious. so i am certain its an allergy or intolerance. so is it all in my head?

Question: implanon expired a month ago can i be pregnant. hey i have had the implanon for 3yrs it was due to be taking out a month ago but i had a issue with my insurance and i still have it in my arm and for about a week now i am experiencing very tender breast i have a increase in thirst i'm tired a lot and i'm making frequent stops to the bathroom and i still have not received my period since last month i took two pregnancy test but they came out neg. is it possibly that i could be pregnant?
Answer: hi if you are having unprotected sex with a man you can get pregnant from the implanon and you can have a miscarriage from having unprotected sexual intercourse. but you could be just having a bad case of the flu. good luck
Expected Response: if your implanon has expired you need to be using another form of birth control until you have it replaced with a new one (now called explanon). i don't know if you are pregnant or not but yes the possibility exists since no birth control method other than surgical sterilization and complete abstinence is 100%. see your medical provider or planned parenthood so you can have a more sensitive pregnancy test and examination.

Question: how to know when congestive heart failure is cured? it was caused by pulmonary hypertension. i've still fluid retention. after 10 days of failed lasix dosage has now been increased to total 160 mg lasix a day. beta blocker has my heart rate averaging 80 bpm. my right foot is often ice cold sometimes my whole right leg. my next cardiologist appt is in 2-1/2 weeks. can i take lasix again?
Answer: you should not take lasikin while on this medication. it is not recommended for people with congestive pulmonary hypertension or other heart problems.
Expected Response: as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). that’s the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.

Question: how do i take ib pro?
Answer: ib pro is an anti-inflammatory medication that is used to treat inflammation. it is also used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Expected Response: if you are taking the over-the-counter product read all directions on the product package before taking this medication. if your doctor has prescribed this medication read the medication guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking ibuprofen and each time you get a refill. if you have any questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. take this medication by mouth usually every 4 to 6 hours with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless your doctor directs you otherwise. do not lie down for at least 10 minutes after taking this drug. if you have stomach upset while taking this medication take it with food milk or an antacid. the dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. to reduce your risk of stomach bleeding and other side effects take this medication at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. do not increase your dose or take this drug more often than directed by your doctor or the package label. for ongoing conditions such as arthritis continue taking this medication as directed by your doctor. when ibuprofen is used by children the dose is based on the child's weight. read the package directions to find the proper dose for your child's weight. consult the pharmacist or doctor if you have questions or if you need help choosing a nonprescription product. for certain conditions (such as arthritis) it may take up to two weeks of taking this drug regularly until you get the full benefit. if you are taking this drug "as needed" (not on a regular schedule) remember that pain medications work best if they are used as the first signs of pain occur. if you wait until the pain has worsened the medication may not work as well. if your condition persists or worsens or if you think you may have a serious medical problem get medical help right away. if you are using the nonprescription product to treat yourself or a child for fever or pain consult the doctor right away if fever worsens or lasts more than 3 days or if pain worsens or lasts more than 10 days.

Question: how can i help research on epilepsy?
Answer: epilepsy is a condition in which the brain is unable to recognize the signs and symptoms of epilepsy. the brain cannot recognize the symptoms of seizures due to abnormal activity in the brain. epilepsy is caused by abnormal brain activity. abnormal brain activation is the inability to recognize a seizure. epilepsy can occur in people who have epilepsy. for more information about epilepsy see the following webmd article: <link>
Expected Response: there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.

Question: i have cast itch. is there a product i can buy that has an extended aerosol spray to help with the itching? . i have been itching for over a month now. i have cast itching. is it possible that i can get the itch from the aerosol or is it more likely that i will get it from the skin care product i use?
Answer: you can use a cream that contains a natural antihistamine that you can apply to the area. it will also help the itch.
Expected Response: do not put anything inside the cast. this could irritate the skin with small micro-cuts which can lead to an infection. do not use talc or creams inside a plaster cast. these become gritty when mixed with sweat which could also irritate the skin and cause an allergy or infection. raise your arm or leg up above chest level for about 1 hour. this can help reduce the swelling and cool the area which would decrease the itch. if it is too intense talk with your pharmacist about using an oral antihistamine for the itching. be cautious about drug-drug interactions or drowsiness. if the itching is still too intense check with you doctor about recasting the area.

Expected Response: your first step is to avoid direct sun exposure alcohol or any other lifestyle factors that may irritate your skin and trigger rosacea outbreaks. there is no cure for rosacea but with treatment you may be able to control the symptoms. antibiotic pills and topical creams may treat symptoms. topical tretinoin compounds and lasers may be used to control refractory rosacea. i have had rosacea since my late 20s (now in my late 30s) here are the tips i've learned: be religious about sunscreen. if i have direct sunlight without sunscreen i will be red for hours experiment and learn which products work best to control your rosacea. everyone is different but once you find stuff stick with it. i've found that baby shampoo as a cleanser while a little drying does the best at controlling my rosacea of all things. i've also found that larenim and pure minerals makeups actually help clear up my rosacea rather than causing more probelms. most of the tips i'd learned when i first got it was about knowing and avoiding triggers. my triggers are sunlight exercise and alcohol.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's always tough to tell what's going on in your body when you're not feeling well. it can be difficult to tell if you're experiencing an "abnormal" response to an ibupropian medication or if you are just experiencing a "patchy" feeling. the good news is ibuprosus is not a common cause of this condition. it is a rare but serious form of pneumonia. it usually begins in the lungs. it may be caused by a viral infection or by an infection that causes a virus. the

Question: what surgery options do i have for prostate cancer advanced or metastatic?
Answer: you can get advanced prostate cancer treatment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy. in advanced prostate surgery you can have a full-term baby. in metastatic prostate surgery the surgeon may require a full hysterectomy to remove the prostate gland.
Expected Response: surgery to treat prostate cancer is usually reserved for men in good health who are younger than 70 and who choose to have surgery. surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and to slow the growth of cancer. surgery choices radical prostatectomy the removal of the prostate and its cancer. it is not usually done if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. orchiectomy the removal of the testicles. this may cause the cancer to shrink and may improve symptoms because prostate cancer often needs the testosterone made by the testicles to grow. turp or transurethral resection of the prostate. this operation can help to relieve bladder problems because it removes part of the tumor that may be blocking the urethra the tube that carries urine from your bladder through your penis. this can keep the tumor from growing for a while. but turp does not take out the whole tumor. what to think about a study suggests that advanced prostate cancer can sometimes be cured if the cancer has spread to only a few lymph nodes and great care is used to completely remove the lymph nodes during prostatectomy. 14 radiation and hormone treatment may be used afterwards to destroy any remaining cancer cells. surgical removal of the testicles ( orchiectomy ) and hormone therapy medicines have some of the same side effects including hot flashes larger breasts loss of sexual desire and the inability to have an erection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does lipitor cause pancreatic cancer. i have read recently that lipitor may be linked to pancreatic cancer. can you verify if there's any studies to support that? there is pancreatic cancer in my immediate family and i am presently taking lipitor. thanks.
Answer: hi yes it could be pancreatic but if you have pancreatic or pancreatic related cancers then you should see your doctor asap good luck
Expected Response: i don't think that anyone knows for sure at this point. pancreatic cancer has been around a long time before lipitor and most people who have pancreatic cancer have never used it. keep abreast of any new information that may surface on the medical sites but an "association" is not necessarily a "cause". you could easily make an association that people who eat at a certain fast food chain have a higher level of a disease than someone who doesn't or that a large percentage of people who have a type of cancer had driven a car prior to the diagnosis. these are "associations". if any definitive studies are found with a causative relationship any suspect drug is immediately pulled from the market.

Question: what resources are available for treating drug addiction if you don’t have insurance?
Answer: if you have insurance you can shop for a plan through the marketplace. if you qualify for medicaid you can also shop for an insurance plan through your state's marketplace.
Expected Response: there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: is pregnancy possible if you start a period 19 hours after sex? bearing in mind that the period was about a week early. i had unprotected sex at around 5am on january 1st. around 11pm the same day i started to bleed lightly (light pink). it continued on and off until the third and didn't become heavier. it's been accompanied by some light cramps but nothing i'd really worry about. the last time i was pregnant i also had a very heavy period and was still found to be <negative_smiley>9 weeks pregnant so i'm just being cautious this time.
Answer: hi you could be just a couple of days late but it would be best to get on bc asap. good luck

Question: my son got sand thrown in his eye and it is swollen. we did rinse it out with water. what is the next step?
Answer: if you are not allergic to sand or any other debris you should not be using a topical antibiotic. the best thing you can do is to use a moisturizer that is designed for the skin and does not contain any medications. if you have a rash or burning sensation that is not caused by sand you should seek medical attention. you can also try a product called zyrtec. it is a product that contains an antihistamine and antihistamines are also available.
Expected Response: ahhh. sandbox eyes. i see this quite often. the next step assuming he is still crying rubbing his eyes and complaining is to see a medical provider to see if he has a corneal abrasion - a painful scratch on the cornea. you will need to take him to an urgent care facility. the medical provider will put a drop or two of an anesthetic solution to numb the eye (instant relief! ). a tiny amount of bright-yellow fluorecein dye will be put in the eye to reveal any scratch. it can be seen using a "black light" in a darkened examination room. if he does have a tiny scratch he will need some antibiotic drops or ointment for a few days while it heals. these things are painful but fortunately they heal very fast.

Question: can i mix magnesium citrate with tea to make it not taste as bad?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. magnesium citrates are a great way to help control your magnesium levels. magnesium is a natural substance that is found naturally in foods and beverages. it is also found in foods like yogurt and fruit juices. it can be found in many other foods like rice and pasta. magnesium also is found in certain foods like eggs and nuts. magnesium can also be found naturally on the skin of the fingers and nails. magnesium-rich foods such as yogurt and fruits can also contain magnesium. you can also find magnesium citric acid in the same way that a lot of other minerals are found naturally. magnesium may also be added to foods like breads and pastas. magnesium has many different names. you may want to search for magnesium citronate in your local drugstore. it may also have a similar name to magnesium citris (magnesium citrate).
Expected Response: i don't think it will matter or change the effectiveness. you can probably mix it with just about anything but it still may not be very palatable. it will likely make you tea taste yucky too.

Question: will you be able to get frost bite exposing your hands for 10 minutes in 30 degrees. a friend of mine said that she was driving a person home who did not want the defroster on in the car so in order to have the window defrosted she had to put the windows down for less than 10 minutes. the temperature outside was 35 degrees so is it possible for this person to get frost bite?
Answer: hi if you have a cold or flu you can get a cold by putting a cold pack on your hands and then put it on. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: it's certainly not likely. frostbite is the term we use when our body's tissue literally freezes. as you can imagine this process can take quite some time. commonly frostbite occurs when bare skin is exposed to sub-freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time. the process can occur faster if the bare skin is for example engulfed in snow or ice. and covered tissue (like skin fingers toes etc. ) isn't protected from frostbite either. many people have had their toes frozen by standing in knee-deep snow for hours even while wearing heavy boots. driving with the car windows down for 10 minutes in 35-degree weather isn't likely to produce frostbite. even if it did it would probably only produce a very mild case involving a few skin layers. hope this answers your question!
================================================================================
Question: i have dark purple blotches under my eyes even though i'm healthy. what causes it?

Expected Response: i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing "bridge therapy" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!

Question: is there estrogen in vitamin e?
Answer: estrogen is a hormone that is produced by the ovaries. estrogen is produced when the body produces enough estrogen to make the body's own estrogen. in women who have had a hysterectomy or a hymenectomy the hormone levels in the blood are elevated. this means that the body can't produce enough estrogen. if you have had an hystectomy your blood levels will be normal. if your blood level is too high estrogen will be produced. if estrogen levels are too low estrogen will not be produced and the body will not produce enough of the hormone.
Expected Response: no. there is no estrogen in vitamin e. vitamin e is not estrogen rich.

Question: why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking. no phlem. wakes me up at night. night and morning only.
Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor for a blood test. good luck
Expected Response: good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!

Question: can shingles appear in the mouth or throat.

Question: is swimming a good exercise for people with disabilities?
Answer: swimming is not a good sport for people who are disabled. swimming is a good activity for people without disabilities. swimming in the pool is a great exercise for those with disabilities. if you are not able to swim in the swimming pool you may be able to get some help from a licensed professional.
Expected Response: water is a great equalizer. it supports body weight and with proper flotation devices most anyone can exercise in the water no matter what the physical disability. check locally at y's recreation centers and other pools for opportunities in your area or click on the usa swimming web site ( <link> ) to learn more (click on the "swimmer" tab and then "disability"). in addition to recreational swimming the united states paralympics swim team ( <link> ) offers athletes with disabilities (amputees blind/visually impaired spinal-cord injured/wheelchair cerebral palsy/brain injury/stroke) the opportunity to compete internationally in swimming. swimming is an activity for virtually anyone who has the will and desire to do so.

Question: can oral sex combined with kissing possibly result in pregnancy? . recently (a few weeks ago) my girlfriend performed oral sex on me and swallowed. we made out (the taste of semen was present in her mouth) and then i performed oral sex on her without thinking that i could have sperm present in my mouth. her period is now somewhat late in coming so we are both worried that she might have gotten pregnant. i know that there is at least a small chance of it but could she have feasibly gotten pregnant from this scenario?
Answer: hi ok ok good luck
Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely that pregnancy could occur from the scenerio that you described. there are many things that cause a delay in the menses including stress. because you both are engaging in intimate sexual activity it may only be a matter of time before you both decide to go the rest of the way and have vaginal sex. i would strongly suggest that you use condoms and that your girlfriend be on another form of effective birth control.
================================================================================
Question: is it common to for the pain of plantar fasciitis to increase after completing the strectch exercises?
Answer: it is common to have plantar fibrosis after completing exercises. plantar infections are usually caused by an infection in the plantar fascia (the part of the body that covers the face and the back of the head). most of the time the plantars are not affected. however plantar infection can occur in a variety of conditions. for example when a person is having an infection and has an infection of the plantor of the foot or ankle the infection may cause pain in the foot. the pain may be worse in the feet than in the toes.
Expected Response: not sure what the answer is but try to roll your foot on an icecold can of pop or the like; back and forth gently rolling. helped me quite a bit.
================================================================================
Question: can a cat puncture wound cause cellulitis. can a cat nail puncture wound cause cellulitis?
Answer: no. cellulitis is a bacterial infection that can be caused by bacteria. it is not contagious.

Question: i have gerd and take prevacid. my symptoms have exacerbated since taking a vitamin d prescription. is that common?
Answer: i have no way of examining you over the internet but i would suggest that you see your primary care medical provider for a proper examination and possibly some blood work.

Question: how many calories do you burn passing a bowel movement?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i know it's difficult to answer this question blindly but i think you should get this straightened out. in general i'd suggest you see a registered dietitian to help you figure out what's going on. you can also talk to a registered exercise physiologist to get some ideas on what's best for you. if you're still having trouble with your bowel movements or if you have a problem with a particular activity or exercise routine it's important to see a dietitician to help figure out if you need to go to the gym or do a weight training program. you might want to look into a dietician to see if you can get some help with a variety of exercises and activities. if not see a certified dietitrist to help with your diet.
Expected Response: you can burn 20 -30 calories in one seating leave your hot seat and go and find some serious workout

Question: can a prescribed steroid to eliminate a cough damage the pancreas and cause related symptoms? . from nov-dec had a cold with cough that didn't want to leave. i took a prescribed steroid a few days then some digestive problems slowly develop in january. dull pain left side won't stop. i've had several scans scopes up/down blood tests - all normal! so tired of this dull pain belching strange tiny bumps on my skin on my abdomen and back tired/fatigue feeling. no diarrhea or vomiting at all. no jaundice but eyes often hurt especially skin just below eyes feel like a sunburn. pre-canc?
Answer: hi yes you should see your doctor and get a blood test done there is a test for chlamydia and a test to see if you are pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're dealing with all of this. it sounds miserable! while nothing's impossible it's highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in january. even though you've been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them. many disease processes develop slowly over time. this means an initial workup (all those tests you had done) won't always reveal an answer. if you get tested later something may show up. i want to add also that i wouldn't jump to a conclusion of cancer or pre-cancer. nothing in your description would lead me to think "cancer. " i'd just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved. take care!

Question: do i need to see a doctor before starting a weight loss program?
Answer: if you are starting a program that includes weight loss it is important that you talk to your doctor about the type of program you are planning. if you have any questions about your program or weight loss plan contact your doctor.
Expected Response: unless you have a chronic illness or take regular medications you don't really need medical supervision when you're starting a weight loss program even if you're obese. there are hundreds of diet books at your local bookstore and i doubt that following any of them would cause any harm. while a really extreme low-calorie diet – 500 calories or so – could be risky nobody can really stick to that anyway. however i do think you should include your doctor as part of your support system and ideally as a lifestyle coach. your doctor can help you monitor your progress as well as provide external accountability.

Question: how often does a doctor legally have to see a patient to continue refilling a prescription on a noncontrolled substance? . i am regularly prescribed a medication for a stable chronic condition. i take it daily. it is not a pain medication or anything that could be abused. for a long time my prescriptions just automatically refilled but now my doctor's office manager is insisting that my prescription refill cannot be authorized because it's illegal to refill a prescription without having seen the patient for a period of time. is this the law or is she lying to make me spend money? . (not pain - topic forced)
Answer: i would suggest that you contact your doctor for a consultation. it's not uncommon for doctors to have to refer patients to their primary care provider for a referral. i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're getting a prescription for a prescription. the law does not prohibit a doctor from seeing patients for a specific reason. in most cases the doctor will have to
Expected Response: there are no "legal requirements". the doctor sets his own rules and parameters when it comes to refills of chronic medications. many clinicians will let you go a year; others six months. while it can be a hassle and added expense to see your medical provider they are responsible for your care. having you come in is a good opportunity to give you a check-up see about your health maintenence that you may be ignoring (blood tests cancer screenings etc. ). make the appointment and discuss this directly with the doctor. not the office manager. ask for a one-year prescription of all of your meds if he is willing.
================================================================================
Question: yeast infection or bladder infection? . my pee smells unusually bad. very strong smell. after i pee it feels like i have to pee again. doesn't hurt to pee. a day a ago i noticed i'm swollen and irritated. itchy. still doesn't hurt to pee. the strong urine smells gone so is the constant feeling of needing to pee. i took vitamin d and was told that could be why my pee smells bad. i don't feel sick but i'm uncomfortable. could it be a yeast infection or both?
Answer: hi if your having a yeast problem its a yeast that is hard to get rid of and it's not going away but you can try getting some help from your doctor or a uk's uk specialist. good luck
Expected Response: it could be both. yeast infections in the vagina tend to itch; urinary infections tend to be painful with urination only and can be accompanied by the urge to urinate even after you have urinated. see your medical provider for a urinalysis to see if you do indeed have an infection needing to be treated. a vaginal yeast infection can usually be treated over the counter with anti-yeast vaginal medications.
================================================================================
Question: how hard is it to get pregant if you have a tilted uterus?
Answer: hi if you are pregnant and you have had a tilted cervix its time to get it checked out and you will be ok. good luck
Expected Response: hey well i have a tilted uterus as well. its not as difficult as you think to get pregnant. i did my homework and researched this when i wanted to get pregnant. if you are wanting to get pregnant it just means you need a little extra help. what my research told me was that certain positions are highly recommended for pregnancy. these positions are man on top with a pillow under your pelvis and also doggy style. these positions provide direct access to the uterus! good luck

Question: what can you give a 4-month-old infant for colds and coughs?
Answer: the baby's immune system is responding to the cold and cough. it is not just the cold. the baby also may have a cold-like rash that is contagious.
Expected Response: as a pharmacist i am very hesitant to recommend anything for a child this young. many medications used to treat cough and cold symptoms are too strong for infants and we have to keep in mind that they are not "little adults. " i would need to discuss with you more about the actual symptoms – and in most cases my recommendations are nonmedication ones like running a vaporizer in the baby's bedroom and using saline drops and a nasal aspirator for a stuffy nose. talk to your pharmacist – they will be happy to help you.
================================================================================
Question: i have pain in my lower right side what can it be it been go on for two day?
Answer: i can't really tell you what type of pain you have but i would suggest you see a doctor. the pain is usually mild but it could be a little more severe. it could also be a bit more serious. i would advise that you see your doctor right away.
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. anytime we have pain that doesn't go away it's cause for concern. unfortunately it's impossible to say what this could be without a physical exam. many conditions could cause the pain you're describing from a case of constipation to an ovarian cyst. if the pain doesn't go away on its own after a few days or if you have other symptoms such as: fever lack of bowel movement pain that increases instead of decreasing nausea and/or vomiting then it's time to seek medical attention. you can start by calling your primary care provider or if you feel the situation is urgent seek out an urgent care facility for an evaluation. i hope you feel better soon!

Question: what is colitis?
Answer: colitis is a viral infection caused by a virus. it is caused by the same virus that causes the common cold.
Expected Response: colitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the colon and is associated with diarrhea pain and blood in the stool. there are numerous reasons for the colon to become inflamed including: infection. loss of blood supply to the colon. inflammatory bowel disease. invasion of the colon wall with collagen or lymphocytic white blood cells. anatomy of the colon the colon is a hollow muscular tube that receives products of digestion from the small intestine and ultimately eliminates them from the body through the anus. the colon is located in the abdomen and has numerous sections that are named based on their location. colitis can affect different sections of the colon. the colon begins in the right lower abdomen with the cecum (located just above the appendix) into which the products of digestion empty from the small intestine. the ascending portion of the colon then ascends from the lower to the upper right side of the abdomen. it traverses the abdomen as the transverse portion of the colon from the right upper to left upper abdomen before descending from the upper to the lower left side of the abdomen. the last portions of the colon are the sigmoid colon low in the abdomen and finally the anus. the colon also has several layers. the mucosa (inner layer or lining) comes into contact with the products of digestion and fluid and actively removes water and electrolytes to help solidify the feces. a layer of smooth muscle (a special type of muscle) surrounds the inner layer and is responsible for squeezing and mixing the undigested food and transporting it through the length of the colon to the anus.

Question: i wake up in the middle of the night choking on a liquid what could this be? . i have been diagnosed with acid reflux and was thinking maybe i had fluid on me. when i burp or swallow liquid follows always making me gag or choke. i was wondering what this could be could it be related to my heart?
Answer: i have no way of examining you over the internet but i would suggest you see a medical professional.
Expected Response: it's entirely possible that the liquid you're referring to is in fact stomach acid. it's not uncommon for reflux to get worse when lying down. did your doctor prescribe something for you to take for the acid reflux? if so and it's not working then i'd suggest you return to the doctor to describe what's going on. he or she may want to change your medication or have you try a mechanical approach to the problem such as elevating the head of your bed on a couple of bricks. you also would be well advised to stop eating within two hours of bedtime. i doubt the symptoms you're describing are related to any heart problem but only your doctor can say for sure. no matter what this issue is having a negative impact on your daily life so you should get it checked out again. best wishes to you!

Question: do i need a yearly pap. i'm 60 years old. post menopausal. i've had three children. i've had yearly pap smears all of my life up until age 55. all of them have been benign. do i need to continue having them? i am asexual. i have been told that i need an annual pap.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's a very difficult time for you. it sounds like you need to see a pap smear specialist for a proper examination. the pap smear is a very sensitive diagnostic tool and can detect many different types of pap smearing. it can also detect a variety of other types of penile cancers. it also can detect a number of other sexually-transmitted diseases. the best way to get the best results is to have a pap smear done. you can do this at home or in a clinic. it may be more expensive but you can get a good deal on a pap
Expected Response: probably not an annual pap unless you have a family history of uterine or cervical cancer had some risky sexual exposure in the past and are not having any gynecological symptoms. remember that a pap smear is just a test. there are other important components on a pelvic examination that should not be skipped. a pap smear only reveals cervical or endocervical cells that may be cancerous. the pelvic examination can find other abnormalities in the uterus ovaries and pelvic area. like suspicious masses etc. hopefully you are getting a mammogram colonoscopy and other preventative tests needed at your age.

Answer: hi yes it would be best if you get some cold water or a warm bath then you can wash your hands and then go to bed. but if you do get a shower then go see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: it is not likely that any clothing that is sold has dangerous dyes. you are safe. but your hot pink washcloth is not warm pink since the dye is not stable in warm or hot temperature.

Question: we have been trying to have sex everytime i insert into her vagina she says it hurts alot to the point we cant have sex. -have had sex before with less problems. . -finger insertion slowly will work. . -when she wants to move on to full insertion she tries by being on top and controlling cant get past 2 inches without saying it hurts too much. -when i push her down i push it to her vagina. -i have tried to have intercourse with her before. -we have tried using condoms and have been having sex.
Answer: hi this is from the uk’s nhs your find it very helpful it is from a women's health society. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: your partner should make a trip to the gynecologist's office to find out what the issue is. many things can cause painful intercourse in women including a yeast infection std and vaginismus. the first step in solving the problem is a physical examination. the gynecologist likely will test for a variety of possible infections before moving on to other potential causes of your partner's painful intercourse. your best bet is to refrain from having sex until an std is ruled out. finger insertion and oral sex both can spread stds like herpes and human papilloma virus (hpv or genital warts). better safe than sorry. once an std has been ruled out keep in mind there are other ways to enjoy the intimacy of sex without insertion. until your partner can resolve the pain issue you can show your love for her by suggesting the two of you enjoy intimacy without pressuring her to have intercourse. wishing you both well!

Question: can hypothyroidism cause premature menopause? . i have hypothyroidism and i am almost 40. my doctor thinks i might be going through the early stages of premature menopause. i have read that hypothyroidism can cause it. is this true?
Answer: hi if you have hypochondria you may have a condition called hypothyroidsias which is caused by a deficiency of iron in the blood. this deficiency is caused when your body's production of iron is limited. it is usually caused by deficiencies of iron-deficiency genes. in the case of hypothyrodism the deficiency of the iron-containing iron-producing genes can cause anemia. you may also have a deficiency in the iron that is needed to make your blood sugar control. this can cause your body to produce too much iron. so you need to get some iron supplements. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck

Answer: i would recommend you see a podiatrist. he or she can help you with your pain. if you have a spinal fusion or herniation you should be able to get a spinal re-injection. this is a procedure in which the spinal fusion is surgically removed and the disc is re-exposed. this procedure is done by a pod
Expected Response: my father is actually going through a very similar scenario currently. his next options after the epidural blocks and steroid blocks is surgery. i believe his two choices for surgery is a fusion vs. removal of the bulging disc.

Question: do undocumented qualify for the insurance? if also unemployed? what will happen in emergency if they don't have one?
Answer: you'll need to file taxes in the fall.

Question: im 16 years old and i take medication for adhd/add. my penis size is small and im curious if my med are the reason why. i've been taking them since about 1st or 2nd grade. if this is the case if i stop taking them will my penis start to grow again?
Answer: i would not recommend that you take any medication for erectile dysfunction. there is a lot of misinformation out there on the subject. it is important to know that you are not alone in this. it can be difficult to make a definitive diagnosis without a hands-on examination. i would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: your adhd medication should have no effect on your penis size. genetics play a role and some young men who feel their penis is small compared to a limited view of others actually have a normal-sized penis when erect. there is a wide variation in penis sizes when flaccid or erect but the vast majority of the male population has average sized penises. there are no ways to make your penis grow bigger. it is what it is.

Expected Response: heartburn is often a sign of a disease called gerd (gastroesophageal reflux disease). although studies have shown a relationship between asthma and gerd the exact relationship is uncertain. gerd may worsen asthma symptoms and make asthma harder to treat. if you have coughing that is not completely resolved by taking your asthma medications then inform your doctor. gerd can be one of the reasons this is happening.

Expected Response: the common symptoms of type 1 diabetes are frequent urination increased thirst and hunger unexplained weight loss fatigue and weakness and mood changes.
================================================================================
Question: what causes hyperthyroidism?
Answer: hyperthyroids are caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. the body produces more thyroid hormone than it needs to produce healthy thyroid hormones in order to function properly. the amount of thyroid hormone in the body is controlled by the body's own body's natural production of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) which is produced by the thyroid gland. the normal levels of tsh are low in women and are usually very low in men. in addition the thyroid hormone production is suppressed by the immune system. the immune response to the body’s natural production is also suppressed by thyroid hormone deficiency. the thyroid's production is affected by many factors including: the amount that is produced in the thyroid glands. the size of the thyroid. the number of thyroid glands in the brain. the type of thyroid gland in the human body. the age of the person. the sex of the individual. the degree of the deficiency of tsh. the severity of the
Expected Response: some common causes of hyperthyroidism include: graves' disease. functioning adenoma ("hot nodule") and toxic multinodular goiter (tmng). excessive intake of thyroid hormones. abnormal secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). excessive iodine intake. graves' disease graves' disease which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in this condition the thyroid gland usually is renegade which means it has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via tsh. graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men. graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. these antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi antibodies) thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) and tsh receptor antibodies. graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard nuclear medicine thyroid scan which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively-labeled iodine. in addition a blood test may reveal elevated tsi levels. functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter the thyroid gland (like many other areas of the body) becomes lumpier as we get older. in the majority of cases these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. occasionally a nodule may become "autonomous " which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation via tsh and produces thyroid hormones independently. this becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. when there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones it is called a functioning nodule. if there is more than one functioning nodule the term toxic multinodular goiter is used. functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan. excessive intake of thyroid hormones taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss. these patients can be identified by having a low uptake of radioactively-labelled iodine (radio-iodine) on a thyroid scan. abnormal secretion of tsh a tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). this leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. this condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. to identify this disorder an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of tsh. thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). this condition is associated with a fever and a sore throat that is often painful on swallowing. the thyroid gland is also tender to the touch. there may be generalized neck aches and pains. inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan. excessive iodine intake the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. an excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. certain medications such as amiodarone (cordarone) which is used in the treatment of heart problems contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.

Question: what causes type 1 diabetes living with complications?
Answer: type 1 diabetics are at higher risk for complications from diabetes than non-diabetics. the risk of complications is highest among those with diabetes. the majority of diabetic patients with type 1 are at risk for other conditions such as heart disease diabetes and cancer. the number of people with type 2 diabetes increases as people age. the most common cause of complications from type 2 diabetism is heart failure. the cause of type 2 complications is unknown but some studies have suggested that certain conditions such DNA damage may cause the disease. the condition may be caused by a genetic defect or by a change in the way the body functions. in the early stages of diabetes the body's immune system attacks cells in the blood to fight off the disease and to prevent the disease from developing. in adults the immune system is weakened by the aging of the body and by the use of medications that suppress the immune response. the immune systems may also be
Expected Response: complications from type 1 diabetes are caused by one or both of the following: damage to the lining of the blood vessels throughout your body causing them to become clogged with hard fatty deposits called plaques. this process is called atherosclerosis. damage to the nerves ( neuropathy ) that reduces or blocks their ability to send messages to your organs legs and arms and other parts of your body. this damage results from excess sugar (glucose) in your body. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: my penis is slightly bend towards right does it going to affect my sex life and how to cure it. i have this condition since birth. it is not a problem at all but i am very sensitive to it.
Answer: hi this is from the uk's nhs you should go see your doctor for a test its a test for hormones and that will tell you if you have this problem or not. good luck
Expected Response: if your penis is only slightly bent it will not interfere with sexual activity. without having an exact diagnosis it would be very premature to know if there was a treatment or cure; you would need to be examined by a urologist first. there is a condition called peyronie's disease that you can read about that involves a bend in the penis during erections. i don't know if you have this particular condition or not since you have had this condition apparently from birth.

Question: what activities cause the psa to rise?
Answer: the pSA is a measure of the level of a person's body's ability to absorb certain nutrients. for example the psell effect is a common symptom of high blood pressure. the psel is a measurement of the amount of oxygen in the blood. it is also a measure that shows how much oxygen is in the body. the more oxygen in a person’s blood the higher the psi.
Expected Response: in general if a man has had a normal psa reading in the past doctors do not tell patients to avoid anything before the next psa test. however if you have had a prior borderline or elevated psa test and want to optimize your chances that the psa is not "artificially" elevated you may want to consider the following: 1. no bike riding for several days. 2. no ejaculation for 48-72 hours but don't abstain too long! 3. no urologic instrumentation such as a urinary catheter or cystoscopy test. 4. no vigorous digital rectal exams or anal sex.

Question: if you have medicare because of disability can you still get a health insurance policy on the marketplace?
Answer: if you qualify for medicare you can get a policy on your state's marketplace. you can find a list of state health insurance plans on the healthcare. gov website.
Expected Response: while technically you are not prevented from buying a policy on a marketplace it is more likely that it will duplicate rather than cover the gaps in your medicare policy. the marketplace is designed for people without insurance or people trying to replace their existing policy. there are no medicare supplemental policies on the marketplaces which sounds more like what you might want. about half of states require medicare supplemental insurers to offer medigap policies to those who are on medicare due to a disability. you can visit a state health assistance insurance program in your state which provides assistance for people with medicare. because of the federal government shutdown the best way to find a ship in your state is www. shiptalk. org.

Question: i am trying to get an understanding about my diastolic pressure. i have visited my doctor and my systolic number has went for 160 to 130 but the diastolic number has not been so successful it is 92 to 85. what does diastolic pressure mean what do i need to be on the look out for and what more can i do.
Answer: hi i think you should read up about your diastolosis. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry this has been bothering you because there's really nothing you need to do regarding your diastolic blood pressure. let me explain. when we measure blood pressure we write it as one number over another: 140/80. the top number 140 is called the "systolic" pressure. the bottom number 80 is called the " diastolic " pressure. we often describe systolic pressure as the pressure inside your blood vessels at the moment the heart squeezes and pushes blood into the arteries. this is the type of pressure that can cause damage to organs and tiny vessels. when we talk about "high blood pressure" or " hypertension " we are mainly referring to the systolic pressure. we often describe diastolic blood pressure as the pressure of the blood "at rest" in the vessels in between heart beats. even when diastolic pressure is "elevated" above normal it generally is not considered a threat to health. in fact with hypertension diastolic pressure almost always rises and falls along with systolic pressure. what's important with your blood pressure numbers is this: they are both trending downward. that is what we always like to see in a person with high blood pressure. so you are doing well! give yourself a pat on the back and stop worrying about getting your diastolic numbers any lower. you're doing a great job. wishing you well!

Question: how common is atopic dermatitis?
Answer: atopic eczema is a skin condition that causes a rash or inflammation of the skin. it is caused by a combination of several factors including genetics and environmental factors. atopic disorder is a condition that can be caused by any of the following: allergies. allergy to certain allergens. certain forms of fungal infections. certain types of skin infections. allergic rhinitis. certain skin conditions such as eczematous rhinosis. certain diseases that cause inflammation of skin such as atopic rhinomyelitis. skin infections that cause skin infections such as fungal atopic infections. dermatitis. the skin is constantly changing. the changes in the skin can be due to changes in environment or by the skin's own immune system. atopy dermatitis is a common skin condition in which the skin changes from red to yellow to green to blue to purple to pink to red. it can also occur in the middle of the
Expected Response: atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and is becoming more common. it affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children and its onset decreases substantially with age. scientists estimate that 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. onset after age 30 is less common and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. people who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. about 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood.

Question: just as there is "good" cholesterol (hdl) and "bad" cholesterol (ldl) there are also "good" triglycerides. explain? . i recently was made aware of good triglycerides. so i did some research and found this paper online <link> can a medical professional or scientist please explain what triglyceride remnants means in layman terms. need clarification on t"he mechanisms by which "bad" triglycerides develop explain why elevated triglycerides and low hdl--and patients with the metabolic syndrome--warrant special attention" why is this?
Answer: hi good luck
Expected Response: none of the major health organizations emphasize good or bad triglycerides -- the study you found was from 2002 and i have found nothing more recent to support it. the key is to think of heart disease risk like a puzzle with many different pieces. risk factors include high triglycerides high total cholesterol high ldl (bad cholesterol) and low hdl (good cholesterol) high blood pressure hyperglycemia and abdominal fat. someone with metabolic syndrome has a cluster of all these risk factors (instead of just one or two) putting them at even higher risk. for more on how to lower triglycerides see this article and for more on optimal blood lipid levels see this one. good luck!

Question: i am currently insured by anthem blue cross blue shield. i haven't received a cancellation letter yet but am told my plan will not be available in 2014. i live 30 minutes from my physicians in utah and have physicians in my home town in nevada. will i be able to find a plan that has both physicians in utah and nevada as in-network care?
Answer: you can call your insurer directly to find out if you qualify for medicaid coverage in the state you live in. if you live outside of the state and are eligible for medicare you will need to pay a premium to pay for a plan in your state. you can also look for a state-based marketplace plan that offers medicaid.
Expected Response: many plans are discontinuing for 2014 in some cases because they don't comply with the law. i suspect it's going to be difficult to find a policy that includes in its network doctors based in different states. you can opt for a ppo option which will allow you to see doctors outside of your network and still get some help covering your costs.

Question: what is chickenpox? what causes chickenpox?
Answer: chickenpox is a viral infection caused by the herpes virus. it is a virus that causes chicken pox. the virus causes the rash and itching that can occur in the skin. it can be spread through direct contact with the infected person's skin. chickenpox can also be transmitted through direct sexual contact.
Expected Response: chickenpox is a common childhood skin disease caused by a viral infection. the virus involved is called the varicella-zoster virus. today chickenpox is less common in the united states due to universal vaccination with the varicella virus vaccine though it still occurs in populations that are not routinely vaccinated. varicella-zoster virus is often categorized with the other common so-called "viral exanthems" (viral rashes) such as measles (rubeola) german measles (rubella) fifth disease (parvovirus b19) mumps virus and roseola (human herpesvirus 6) but these viruses are unrelated except for their tendency to cause rashes. in unimmunized populations most people contract chickenpox by age 15 the majority between ages 5 and 9 but all ages can contract it. chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and very young infants than children. winter and spring are the most common times of the year for chickenpox to occur.

Answer: hi if you look at the numbers you can see that cholesterol is a very important factor in your life. so your find that if you are overweight you are at a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. so if you have a healthy diet then you should be doing well. but you do need to eat a healthy balanced diet. if you do not eat well then it may be time for you to see your doctor or dietitian for a blood test. good luck
Expected Response: the good news is your hdl is high (87) which is good. i would look more into the quality of your diet. do you eat enough fiber from fruits vegetables beans and whole grains? how about foods known to help lower cholesterol like oats and nuts? do you get saturated fat from cheese sweets and eating out? i would focus on diet quality -- adding foods to your diet that are heart healthy -- and then get your cholesterol re-checked. for more tips on how to lower your cholesterol see this article good luck!

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish i could tell you what's causing your pain but there are many possibilities. there are no bodily organs in the area you describe. there are only small intestine and the colon. if you are eating and drinking passing gas and having bowel movements those are all good signs your colon is working well. an ovarian cyst can cause pain like you describe and so could healing after a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. as scar tissue forms inside it can contract and be quite painful. this usually clears up over time. the area can indeed feel "lumpy" inside where sutures have been placed. this too should go away with time. i suggest you contact your gynecologist about the pain. he or she is in a better position to give you an opinion about the cause because s/he knows your complete medical history. you have a right to have your pain controlled. this may not mean you have no pain at all. but on a 0-10 scale where 0 is no pain you should be able to aim for pain in the 3-4 range. if your pain is worse than that (and it sounds like it is) contact your doctor for better management of the situation. wishing you well!

Question: is it safe to "push through" fibromyalgia pain? . every time i even attempt to do any sort of exercise the pain doesn't really allow me to do anything. i used to be an athlete many years ago and i would just push through the pain or keep going until the pain went away. i haven't been able to work for years since my accident and fibromyalgia and it is very frustrating. . i am wondering if i can do any damage to my body if i push through the pain? . is it safe to force my body to work through the pain and attempt exercise?
Answer: hi try doing some stretching and stretching exercises for fibromyemia and try doing a couple of times a week for a week or so. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it. if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks. i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want. but there are painful consequences. it could cause you to be unable to do anything. i just know that "pacing yourself" is the watch word here. pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life. it's harder to do than say and requires practice. we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities. i hope this help. start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up. i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non-contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about. good luck hope this helps. and do not forget to stretch!

Question: can a multivitamin cause acne? . i'm a 28 year old male. i've been on multivitamins for about 2 years now. i have a multibillion dollar medical bill and i have no insurance. i'm not a big fan of the multivits. i would like to see what they are for.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a health problem. i'd suggest you see a dermatologist -- someone who can examine you and order a multigrain. you may want to consider seeing a dermatology nurse -- someone that can examine your skin and order an evaluation. there are many different types of dermatology and they can help you determine which type of multivitis is causing your acne. i hope you're able to find the right treatment for your skin condition. i wish you all the best with this!
Expected Response: no multivitamins will not cause acne. the most common cause of acne is your own hormones. they most definitely will. i think it has to do with the biotin in my multivitamin. before my multivitamin i started taking biotin to think it would make my hair and nails longer and my face glow. boy was i wrong! i've never had such bad acne in my life - to the point of cystic acne! it was embarrassing and painful! happy to say that as soon as i stopped taking it my face returned to normal and i was never so pleased with my own skin before! a couple months later (i completely forgot about the biotin incident) my mother mentioned how i should take a multivitamin since i'm a vegetarian and don't get all the nutrients i need. so silly me - "yeah sure mom grab a bottle for me! it'll be great! " i didn't even look at the label and about 2-3 weeks into taking half a pill every-other day i started to break out like crazy on the left side of my face mostly my cheek. at first i thought it was due to stress but no way it was because of the multivitamin. i also researched it some b vitamins and iodine are two other big causes of acne. "grrrreat their all bundled up in the little capsule to destroy my face! " moral of the story be weary multivitamins sound appealing but can be toxic (even in small doses)! no. multivitamin does not cause acne.

Answer: i am sorry to hear you are experiencing this. it is not unusual for the rash to appear on the skin of the body. it may be caused by a chemical reaction or a virus. it could be caused from a chemical imbalance. the best thing to do is see a medical provider.
Expected Response: did you ever figure it out? i am a rn and am having the same problem. doctors tell me to take benadryl (which makes it difficult to work efficiently as i am exhausted when taking this medication). i have not yet seen a dermatologist but would like to know what you found out.

Question: i have a question about what happened to my dad. he died on 11/7 from a gangrene infection. . he had colon cancer (stage iv)with a small tumor in the intestine (no blockage) and several metastases on his liver. he had been taking chemo with avastin. we took him to the hospital because he had shortness of breath turned out he had fluid in his lungs and abdomen. how did the gangrene occur? does the fluid block circulation? and why didn't the hospital notice a severe infection like that? how does a person who had no wounds get gangrene and why they would just let him languish?
Answer: hi this is from the uk's nhs the ud's nhhs says the following about gangrene: "gangrene is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks cells that have become infected with a foreign substance such as a virus or bacteria. it is also called viral gangrene. "
Expected Response: i'm so sorry you lost your dad. i lost my dad a couple of years ago. i completely understand your wanting answers about how he died. perhaps the best answer is this: medicine doesn't know everything. we can't keep people from dying. it's no comfort to know that but it's true. from a pathophysiology standpoint i can tell you this: if your dad had metastases (spread of the cancer) on his liver the chances are good he had them elsewhere including the lungs. a doctor once described cancer to me this way: it's similar to starting a row of dominoes tumbling. once cells turn cancerous in one place they begin to turn cancerous in many other places in a domino effect. that means your dad may have had metastases to his lungs and other vital organs as well as his liver. how did the gangrene occur? well i can't tell you that exactly. gangrene is an infection and infections definitely can occur without any wounds. fluid build-up can cause an infection. gangrene may have been the cause of your father's death but another likely culprit is sepsis. sepsis occurs when an infection overwhelms the body's immune system and shuts down all the organs. sepsis frequently is the cause of death in people with pneumonia and other conditions. i'm sorry you feel the hospital allowed your father to languish. i'm sorry he passed away. i hope you are proud that he fought until the very end. i wish i had answers for you. i wish i could take the pain away. i hope you know i sincerely share your pain over this loss. my sympathy to you and your family.

Question: what's the link between a common cold and obesity?
Answer: the link is not clear. the link may be linked to a variety of conditions including: a common viral infection. a common infection that can be spread through contact with contaminated food or drink. a viral infection that causes a cough. a cold that is spread through a cold sore. a cough that is caused by a virus. a fever. a sore throat. a flu. a yeast infection. an ear infection.
Expected Response: feed a fever starve a cold… gain a few pounds? new research from rady children’s hospital in san diego published in the journal pediatrics sheds new light on the possible relationship between obesity and the common cold. this small study of 124 kids tested for antibodies to a particular form of adenovirus which can cause colds and diarrhea. fifteen percent of the kids had antibodies to the virus suggested that they had been exposed to it previously. but the interesting thing was that on average kids who tested positive for the virus were fifty pounds heavier than kids who had not gotten this strain of the common cold. and even when the obese kids were studied separately the antibody-positive group was 35 pounds heavier than the obese children who had not been exposed to the virus. so it appears as though there may be a link between infection with a cold virus and obesity. now what? do we steer our efforts away from diet and exercise and more toward hand washing and vaccine development? not so fast although it’s an intriguing new direction. healthy lifestyle choices and education are the best tools we currently have to prevent obesity in our kids — and ourselves for that matter. but research like this continues to flush out the role that inflammation can have in disease processes and potentially disease management. years ago we started thinking about cardiovascular disease in a similar way. we knew that cholesterol-rich plaque deposited in blood vessel walls was ultimately responsible for heart attacks but we still didn’t understand how it got there. people latched onto diet as one modifiable contributor — hence recommendations to eat more fish and less saturated fat. but our understanding has evolved to a point where we recognize that inflammation has a critical role in determining who gets atherosclerosis. at one point we even identified a higher prevalence of anti-chlamydial antibodies in individuals with heart disease. this led to studies of using antibiotics as a possible preventive measure but unfortunately it didn’t really work. but the concept of inflammation continues to guide future research and has even steered our thinking regarding how diet may be playing a role. understanding inflammation will likely be one of the keys to understand heart disease and how it can be prevented. it’s fascinating to think that childhood obesity — and possibly other chronic disease processes — will fall under a similar umbrella. speaking of umbrellas it may turn out that walking outdoors with wet hair is worse for you than we thought.

Question: can anyone get dental implants? . i am a female and i am not a dentist. i have no insurance. i do not have insurance at all. i am very worried about dental implants.
Answer: dental implants are not required by the law.
Expected Response: in most cases anyone healthy enough to undergo a routine dental extraction or oral surgery can be considered for a dental implant. patients should have healthy gums and enough bone to hold the implant. they also must be committed to good oral hygiene and regular dental visits. heavy smokers people suffering from uncontrolled chronic disorders - such as diabetes or heart disease - or patients who have had radiation therapy to the head/neck area need to be evaluated on an individual basis. if you are considering implants talk to your dentist to see if they are right for you.

Question: why am i losing my hair after weight loss surgery and how do i stop it? . i take biotin (7500mcg) b complex vitamin a zinc and vitamin d supplements daily but my hair just falls out in handfuls. i prefer not to wear a wig so any help would be appreciated.
Answer: hi if your not getting any hair loss you need to take the biotin for a while then do it. but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: this could be nutritional and a lack of protein could be contributing. it sounds like the nutritional supplements you are taking contain vitamins and minerals that can help with hair growth. however after weight loss surgery a lack of protein in the diet can contribute to hair loss. you need to talk to your doctor to determine the best ways for you to get more protein -- and to determine if that might be the cause. you should eat a variety of types of protein including meat beans eggs rice etc.

Question: i have genital herpes and i take zovorax everyday and i haven't had an outbreak should i still tell my partner?
Answer: yes. if you are having a genital herpes outbreak and you have been exposed to it you should talk to your partner about it. if your partner is not sexually active he or she should talk about it with you. if he or her is not having an outbreak he or they should talk with you about it too. if the outbreak is in your genital area and you are not sexually involved you should not have sex with him or her.
Expected Response: i suppose it's not strictly necessary but it's the right thing to do especially if you also let them know about the fact that you haven't had an outbreak. they do have the right to assess their own risk and not telling them takes that choice away. any partner worth your time will respect and value your honesty.

Question: i'd like to know what the best combination of supplements are for a vegan including enzymes amino acids and vitamins. i've been looking into collagen (to improve bone density skin and hair) spirulina (for protein and immune function) maca powder(hormonal function and fertility) omega3 6 9 and digestive enzymes (to help with bloating and stomach problems). i also take a multi vitamin. i am overwhelmed with the wealth of information and would like advice on the best combination as i don't want to take too many supplements when i don't fully understand how they might effect each other. thanks in advance.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's impossible to tell you what to take without first seeing your primary care provider. many things can cause a change in your diet and lifestyle. i wish you all the best! i'm not a doctor so i can't give you a specific recommendation but i can tell you that supplements can help with some of
Expected Response: i'm not familiar with the supplements you are taking. you can look here for more info. my guess is there isn't a lot of evidence to support them. i can help you from a nutrition standpoint though. if you are a vegan and eat a balanced diet you still need to watch out for the following nutrients: calcium: this article will help you figure out if you are getting enough. plant foods and fortified milk alternatives can get you there but you need to be diligent. you can always supplement if you fall short. iron: beans and grains contain iron but they aren't absorbed as well as animal foods. this article can help you ensure you get enough. vitamin b12: plant foods do not contain vitamin b12 so you will can include fortified foods or take a supplement. vitamin d: this vitamin is not in plant foods unless its fortified. you will likely need to supplement. i recommend getting your levels checked at annual physical to determine how much you need. omega 3s dha and epa: plant foods do not contain these important fats -- there are vegan supplements you can look into. if you are still confused consider seeing a registered dietitian. he/she can help you figure out what supplements you need and what you can just get from food good luck!

Question: how is the source of nausea or vomiting diagnosed?
Answer: the answer to this question depends on the cause. there are several different types of nausea. some are caused by a virus or other viral infection. others are caused from an infection. some of the most common causes of nausea are: vomiting. nausea is usually caused by an infection or other virus. vomiting can occur in many different ways. the most commonly occurring causes are: viral infections. viral infections are viral infections that cause a variety of symptoms that may mimic the symptoms of a cold or flu. viral infection is also called a gastroenteritis. gastroenteritus is a condition that causes vomiting. it is caused by the common cold or influenza virus. the common flu virus is also known as the flu. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). gerd is a common cold that is caused in part by an illness called a flu. gerd can also be caused by other viruses such as the common herpes virus.
Expected Response: the health care provider will try to find the underlying illness that is causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. at the same time steps will be taken to treat the symptoms and prevent dehydration. any testing will likely be directed to finding the underlying diagnosis. however blood tests may be taken to assess whether the electrolyte balance in the body has been disturbed due to dehydration from continued vomiting. a urinalysis may be done. concentrated urine is associated with dehydration as the kidneys try to hold onto water in the body. ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.

Question: how do i treat severe heartburn?
Answer: if you are experiencing severe chest pain and chest pain for more than a week or more you may need to see your primary care provider. if you have chest pain that lasts more than two weeks see your doctor. if your chest pain is severe you may have a heart attack or stroke. if chest pain persists you may be at higher risk for heart failure. if this is the first time you have heartburn you may want to see a doctor to see if you can get a chest x-ray. chest x rays are usually done at the same time each day. if the chest x ray is not working you may also have a chest infection. if it is not doing the job you should see your medical provider for a chest examination.
Expected Response: when severe heartburn and acid reflux happen nearly all the time it could be gerd or gastroesophageal reflux disease. with chronic heartburn your doctor may prescribe a procedure called an endoscopy that allows the specialist to look inside your esophagus to see whether acid reflux has eroded the delicate lining of your esophagus or caused other damage. here are a few self-care tips: eat smaller meals well before bedtime. avoid triggers such as caffeine and spicy foods. cut back on alcohol and caffeine. stop smoking. lose weight if you're overweight. cut back on aspirin and pain relievers if you take them often. if diet and lifestyle changes don't work you might try: over-the-counter antacids such as maalox rolaids and tums. they may not be as effective for chronic heartburn. acid blockers like axid pepcid tagamet and zantac last longer and can be effective for several hours at a time says the aga. drugs called proton pump inhibitors or ppis. they shut down tiny proton pumps in the stomach that produce acid lowering acid levels dramatically. one ppi prilosec is available over the counter. reglan is a prescription drug that works to stop acid reflux by speeding up how quickly your stomach empties. faster digestion means less heartburn. gaviscon an over-the-counter heartburn treatment works as both an antacid and a foam barrier where your esophagus empties into the top of your stomach.

Question: how long is mono contagious?
Answer: mono is not contagious.
Expected Response: infectious mononucleosis or “mono” is caused by epstein-barr virus (ebv) a member of the herpes virus family. it’s spread during close physical contact mostly through transmission of saliva. (that’s pretty close earning mono its nickname “kissing disease. ”) ninety percent to 95% of people in the u. s. eventually are infected by ebv although not all of them develop full-blown mononucleosis. people can transmit ebv to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. in studies many people continue to have ebv in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. that’s why most people who get mononucleosis don’t remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. it’s also possible to periodically shed ebv virus in one’s saliva throughout life without having symptoms. it’s not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. fever sore throat fatigue and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. the worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks but fatigue can last for months. vetsika ek. expert reviews in molecular medicine 2004; vol 6(23): pp 1-16. fafi-kremer s. journal of infectious disease 2005; vol 191(6): pp 985-989.

Question: herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .
Answer: hi i think your find it would be best to get on a couple of sites like google genital herpes and if you find out that you have genital hsv you can go see your doctor and get tested. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens. for example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice. when we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again. that said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible. in the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body. we even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place: 'genital herpes' or 'cold sore' or 'whitlow' (on the finger or hand). though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites. in other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection. if reinfection does (unusually) happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals. if reinfection does take place (and i stress it is rare) then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip. around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences. let's not get hysterical about the common cold sore. shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter. by its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies.

Question: besides tender swollen lymph node in neck also have lump in front of ear. presently on clyndamycin. possible causes? . swollen lymph node in neck and lump in front of ear appeared suddenly. was ordered clindamycin (on day 3) and no change in swelling at either site. initially had low grade fever. possible cause?
Answer: yes. there is a lump in the middle of your neck that may be a sign of a lymph node. it may be an infection of the lymph nodes. the lump is a sign that you are having a viral infection.
Expected Response: update from original post. saw ent had biopsy done and ct scan. biopsy was negative for cancer. swelling by ear is gone and one in neck is somewhat smaller. the ent wants me to have the lymph node (neck) removed and biopsied. i'm not in good health have intractable facial nerve pain from dental procedure (going thru nerve blocks for that) among other conditions. i want to wait on removing the lymph node as none of the tests showed a definitive problem. need some advice. probably will ask for a second opinion.

Question: im on triquilar for 2 months and ive been having unprotected sex with my fiancé and we're both healthy. everyone said that triquilar ed causes loss of libido but its been burning me down there after sex everytime. is it part of loss of libido. is it cause of the pill? should i change it? . thanks.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're experiencing some sort of hormonal imbalance. it's possible that your fiancé is taking the triquiline. it may be a hormone imbalance that's causing your body to burn you down. that's why it's important to talk to your health care provider about this. if you're not getting the right results from your treatment plan it's probably best to talk with your health-care provider about the benefits of taking the pill. he or she may want to consider a different form of contraception to help prevent pregnancy. if your fiancée
Expected Response: no its only after sex. it lasts for 3 hours or 4. it gets so red from the outside and my fiancé told me that he has been realizing that im dryer than before. its lil but embarrassing

Question: how is atherosclerosis treated?
Answer: most helpful answer most atherosclerotic disease is treated with medications. but there are many medications that are not used to treat atherosides. for example some medications can cause a decrease in blood flow to the heart. these medications can also cause a rise in cholesterol levels.
Expected Response: once a blockage is there it's generally there to stay. with medication and lifestyle changes though plaques may slow or stop growing. they may even shrink slightly with aggressive treatment. lifestyle changes: reducing the lifestyle risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis will slow or stop the process. that means a healthy diet exercise and no smoking. medication:taking drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure will slow and perhaps even halt the progression of atherosclerosis as well as lower your risk of heart attacks and stroke. using invasive techniques doctors can also open up blockages from atherosclerosis or go around them: angiography and stenting: cardiac catheterization with angiography of the coronary arteries is the most common angiography procedure performed. angioplasty (catheters with balloon tips) and stenting can often open up a blocked artery. bypass surgery: surgeons "harvest" a healthy blood vessel (often from the leg or chest). they use the healthy vessel to bypass a segment blocked by atherosclerosis. these procedures involve a risk of complications. they are usually saved for people with significant symptoms or limitations caused by atherosclerosis.

Question: i am eligible for medicare in may 2014. i currently have no health insurance. am i required to sign up for the aca?
Answer: you are not required to enroll in medicare but you can shop for insurance through the marketplace.
Expected Response: most helpful answer under the law you can go without health insurance for up to three consecutive months without facing a penalty. since you're not eligible for medicare until may you will exceed that limit. the penalty is applied to each month you're uninsured. for 2014 the clock doesn't start until april 1. in your case therefore you're only skipping coverage for one month that is subject to the penalty. the penalty is the greater of $95 or 1% of your annual income. so you'll pay 1/12 of the yearly penalty -- it's likely to be a very small amount and no doubt much less expensive than buying insurance. however going without health insurance is a huge risk. if you're injured or diagnosed with an illness between now and may you're completely on your own with regard to the medical bills you'll incur.

Answer: hi if you have a high blood pressure then you need to go get some help from your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: blood pressure will be high after excersising. moving around will cause the bp to go up which is why they always have you sit when you are at the doctor's office. even just standing can raise your bp. i would let your doctor know this at your next visit though as i am not sure if it should be going that high. good luck!

Question: what is hair loss?
Answer: hair loss is a common side effect of hair loss. it is caused by the removal of excess hair follicles and by the accumulation of hair in the scalp. it can be caused by several conditions. in the first place hair loss can be a sign of a genetic disorder. the disorder may be hereditary or genetic. the condition may also be caused from an abnormal environment. for example hair loss may occur due to a change in the environment in which the hair is shed. it may also occur due either to the presence of abnormal or abnormal growth patterns in the hair follicle. hair loss often occurs in the fallopian tubes which are located in the outer part of the abdomen.

Question: how can i treat adult acne?
Answer: acne is caused by the production of chemicals in the skin. acne can be caused by many different types of acne. some of the most common types of skin cancer are acne vulgaris (pinkheads) and acne vulgara (brown spots). the most commonly used treatment for acne is topical steroids such as salicylic acid and retinoids. topical steroids are used to treat acne vulgariata (scarring) and rosacea (scarred patches).
Expected Response: acne is not caused by dirty skin or by eating sweet or fried foods. acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. the worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly. one would think that as you age you would no longer have issues with acne. however women are especially prone to adult hormonal acne because your androgen levels fluctuate with your monthly cycle. other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. the women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. this form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. this becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin. keeping your face clean is a good beginning and you may want to turn to some of the many acne medications on the market but be aware that these are formulated for severe teen acne and will be very strong. if you wish to try these formulations try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. watch what you put on your face. steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate lanolin lauryl alcohol oleic acid vegetable butters oils and waxes. if over-the-counter acne solutions don't work for you you should make an appointment with your dermatologist. there are prescription medications that can be very helpful to you.

Question: what is the difference between a class 1 and class 2 narcotic?
Answer: class 1 narcotic is a class of drugs that is used to treat a variety of conditions. class 2 drugs are used for pain management.
Expected Response: in the united states narcotics are classified by the drug enforcement administration (dea) into different "schedules" based on several criteria. schedule i substances are defined as drugs with no known medical application and a high potential for abuse. schedule i substances include narcotics like cocaine and heroin. interestingly however marijuana also is classified as a schedule i substance. it remains to be seen if this will change as some states have voted to legalize marijuana and claim it has medicinal properties. schedule ii substances include narcotics that are deemed to have therapeutic benefits yet maintain a high potential for abuse. these include morphine fentanyl and even "mixed amphetamine salts" (the brand name adderall). so basically the difference between schedule i substances and schedule ii is simply in whether or not a drug is deemed to have a valid medical application. hope that clears things up for you! in the u. s. prescription drugs are categorized through the controlled substances act which places drugs into classes or schedules according to the government’s view of potential for abuse. schedule 1 drugs are also referred to as class 1 drugs. drugs that fall under schedule 1 classification are illicit or illegal drugs have no medicinal purpose or use have an increased potential for abuse and if the drug poses a safety issue. narcotics such as lsd heroin and cocaine are all schedule 1 drugs and although two states (colorado and washington) have legalized it and other states allow use for medicinal purposes marijuana is also still classified as a schedule 1 drug. schedule 2 drugs have acceptable medical use and importance an increased potential for dependency abuse and severe addiction. schedule 2 includes opiates with high dose codeine opium morphine oxycodone and fentanyl as well as barbiturates and methamphetamine. schedule 2 drugs also include the adhd drug adderall. the primary difference between a schedule 1 and a schedule 2 drug is whether there is a valid medical purpose for the drug. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: are there physical symptoms for overwhelming guilt? . if i've done something i'm not proud of i have an urge to confess. however i may be scared to confess. i start feeling very stressed and i get a sick feeling in my stomach. is that just an emotional change or is that a physical symptom in my body? are there physical symptoms?
Answer: the answer to your question is: no. there are no physical symptoms that you can feel like you are experiencing. it is normal for the body to feel stressed. however it is not normal for a person to feel sick. it would not be possible to determine the cause of your symptoms based solely on your description. the only way to know for sure is to see a medical professional.
Expected Response: it's definitely possible to experience real physical symptoms from emotions. so yes that sick feeling in the stomach could be a true physical symptom of your guilty feelings. stress can produce many physical symptoms from a racing heart to dermatitis. some people's bodies are very sensitive to emotion and express those emotions through physical symptoms. i'm sorry you're going through this and suggest you get counseling to help relieve both your feelings of guilt and the physical symptoms those feelings are causing. best wishes to you!

Question: how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant? . we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i don't want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i don't want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he doesn't quit as well. i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker. he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do!
Answer: hi if you have a lot of smokers you can get pregnant you can do that but if you do not then you will have to wait till you get your period but you can try some natural ways out of smoking. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking!

Question: i have hurt my inner knee before playing football a 2-3 years ago. now im feeling the same pains again what should i do? . the football injury i had my schools trainer check and she said it was pinched cartalidge. it got really swollen and in 3-4 days it went back down but the pains didnt. the pains happen when i walk especially when putting pressure on my heel. the pain isnt unbearable but it surely is annoying since walking is a huge part of where i need to be. i am also very tired. i cant stand the pain in my knee.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i wish you all the best with your recovery! the pain you describe could be caused by a variety of things. the most common cause is a torn ligament (usually a torn tendon) or a torn muscle. a torn tear can cause a pain in the knee joint. the same can be said for a torn ankle or a tendon.
Expected Response: you will need to see an orthopedist for a thorough examination of your knee and probably an mri of that problematic joint. since this problem has been going on for 2-3 years it is high-time for you to get it checked out medically. the school's trainer may have just guessed and a guess is not a diagnosis.

Question: i did not believe the second-hand smoke showed positive in a drug screen. does it or not? . my adult grandson is staying with me at this time. he does smoke pot. i have gotten high from only his second hand smoke. by 'high' i mean i fell asleep in my recliner. i have chronic pain and am never without pain. he smoked in same room for two days and i had no pain since i can ever remember. it did not show on a ua. it has been 8+ years since i actually smoked any pot. is there a chance i could show positive even though i do not smoke pot?
Answer: no it is not possible for a drug test to show positive for marijuana. it is a very low level of marijuana in the system.
Expected Response: it depends on how much came in to your body. if you were breathing the smoke even a little bit you are technically smoking it or breathing it anyway. if it was enough to give you a relief from your pain then it could possibly show up on a test. it could easily be that the small amount you got from second hand smoke was enough to help you but not enough to show on the ua but i'd advise caution if you have to go through those a lot.

Question: how many doses of recephin are safe for child. my 5 year old was diagnosed with e-coli and has had 3 shots of rocephin but still has a trace of blood and leuks is it safe to give her more?
Answer: i am sorry you are going through this. i hope your child is feeling better soon. i do not know anything about your child's medical history or your child’s medical history but i would strongly suggest that you make an appointment with your pediatrician to discuss your concerns. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: yes it is safe but may not be necessary. i am assuming this is a urinary tract infection so a trace of blood or leukocytes may not be clinical significant now but if the medical provider determines another rocephin injection is needed it is safe.

Question: i’ve been using an antiaging cream & saw definite improvement. now my skin feels irritated. can you overuse a product?
Answer: hi if you think it's just a pimple then go see your doctor and get it checked out its a good thing you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: it is difficult to assess what is causing your skin irritation. have you been out in the sun without sunscreen? some antiaging products make your skin more susceptible to the sun. you may now require more sunscreen or may have used another substance on your skin (like makeup) that doesn’t mix well with your antiaging cream. typically we suggest that you stop using everything and reintroduce one at a time. you may have used too much. try smaller amounts and see if you can again get the improvements without the irritation. if it persists go to your dermatologist for help. i think over using these creams must have caused the irritation. i would suggest you to use natural products for your skin as they have no side effects on your skin. visit asyana at <link> to know more about these natural tanning products as they keep your skin hydrated.

Question: i may begin bp medication in the near future. what are the different classes of bp meds and the pros/cons of each.
Answer: the major difference between the two is that bp medications are used to treat a variety of conditions including heart disease and certain types of arthritis. however there are many different types of bpd medications that may be used to help treat a range of conditions. the main difference is that some medications are more effective than others. for example some drugs are more likely to cause side effects than others and some medications may cause side-effects. the difference in the types of medications is that the type of medication is different. some medications can be used for a variety reasons and some can be taken for a specific reason. the medications that are most effective for treating a variety conditions are the ones that are specifically prescribed to treat certain types or conditions. for instance some medications that have been approved by the fda are used for certain conditions. some of the medications for
Expected Response: most helpful answer this is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider. it's a bit too involved to go into here but i'll briefly outline some (not all) of the options. and luckily webmd offers this handy comparison of some common blood pressure medications. a water pill or diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system. this essentially lowers your overall blood volume. if you have tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) you should talk to your health care provider about using a "potassium-sparing" water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse. ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have become a popular choice. these medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure. these medications usually have few side effects. beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts. this combination causes your blood pressure to come down. if your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions. some beta blockers shouldn't be taken when your pulse rate is low. again you ask a good question for your doctor. if you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does (specifically) why it's a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for. hope this helps!

Question: are there any contraindications for taking protonix and prilosec together?
Answer: there are no contrainds that would prevent you from taking projetet or prilosapentaenoic acid (protonix) together. you can take both at the same time or you can combine them at home.

Question: 12 weeks pregnant due jan 20th. last period april 15th. had sex may 2nd and on april 15 during cycle. whose father? . i did pregnancy calculator i'm guessing it's about 95% may 2nd but still nervous. jan 20th minus 38 weeks equals april 29th 30th but had sex on may 2nd. but than also took a plan b pill on may 4th (about 45 hrs later) and still got pregnant.
Answer: hi if you have a plan bc you should have unprotected sex on july 15th and have unprotected intercourse on june 15th then you should be ok. but if you had unprotected sex before july 14th then your not pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi again lets see if this helps you so your cycle day 1 first day of your period day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day now you guys sperm needs to be in place for this and it takes 3 days for it to get there after unprotected sex and once its there can live for around 7 days but its best if you have sex around day 9 the sperm splits up some goes the left ovary and some to the right so out pops you egg and away you go hopefully to pregnancy if on day 21 you get spotting its because its implantation day the day the egg implants itself into the womb lining. so this you should know? yes. but the thing is some women can get pregnant from having unprotected sex during there period it can happen some times its our male sperm it lives just that little bit longer and if your egg drops a day early away you go pregnant. its a funny old world getting pregnant and there are some women who can get pregnant from anytime of the month again funny old world. so as you have already tried to get rid of it have you thought of the abortion pill as your next step this is just a thought. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: are shingles spread just by being in the same room as someone who has it. my mother is also having shingled symptoms. she has been told to take her to the hospital but she is not. she is taking a lot of pain meds and is taking the flu shot. she also is getting her fever. she told me to call her doctor and she is worried.
Answer: hi if your not sure what you are getting then go to your doctor and get a test done there is a link to this link it should help you. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: from what my doctor has told me because i did have it at one time. it is not an airborn virus so the only way that someone can get it is if they themselves touch the infected area or the person who has it has touched it then touches something or someone without washing their hands. if you have not had chicken pox or been vaccinated for chicken pox you cannot get shingles but you would break out with chicken pox.

Question: i read that brushing too hard is bad. over the past 2 months my teeth have become rather yellow. is this tooth damage?
Answer: yes it is. brushing too much is bad for the teeth. if you are not using a fluoride toothbrush then it is not likely that you will have dental problems. fluoride is a water soluble substance that is very water soluble. brushing your teeth is not a good idea if you have dental disease.
Expected Response: most likely it’s time for a professional cleaning. aggressive brushing is bad because of possible abrasion of the teeth. but the yellowing is most likely extrinsic staining that can be removed by a dental hygienist.

Answer: hi you have had unprotected sex on 4/1/12 and now you are not pregnant. do you think you could have a miscarriage? if so your still pregnant and your still having periods. good luck
Expected Response: if you have a fairly regular 28 day cycle a period due on 25th of may would indicate ovulation was expected to be around 11th of may. the 4th of may is 7 days before that but sperm only live about 4 days (at most 5 days) while swimming around searching for the egg. pregnancy would seem unlikely but it all depends on the regularity of your cycle and your certainty about the dates provided.

Question: how soon does the food you eat affect your cholesterol? how long does food you eat affect your cholesterol?
Answer: food is a good source of cholesterol. it is a powerful antioxidant and a good food source of vitamin a. it's important to eat foods with high amounts of fat and cholesterol. you can eat more than just a few servings of food. the more you eat the more your body will need to absorb the nutrients from the food. so it's not as important to have a healthy diet as it is to have healthy cholesterol.

Question: can castor oil cure cataracts and other conditions. i have been taking it for the past year. i am not sure if it is safe or not. i would like to know if it would be a good idea to take it for a few days and see if it helps. i want to know what it is for and what it would take.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. i know you are concerned about the safety of taking cataract oil. the ingredients in cataracaract are very similar to those in other medications. however it is important to note that it is not a cure for catarasis. it is a cosmetic procedure that can be done without the use of a surgical instrument. it may be a temporary relief from the pain and discomfort of cataractic conditions. it can be used safely and effectively for a number of reasons. first the ingredients are very different than those in many other medications such as penicillin.

================================================================================
Question: how is colitis diagnosed?
Answer: the diagnosis of colitis is based on the presence of a specific type of inflammation that is associated with the inflammation. the inflammation that results from the inflammation is called a "cortisone-like" inflammation. for example a person with colitis may have a type of colic that is more common in the upper gastrointestinal tract. the diagnosis is based upon the presence or absence of a particular type of inflammatory inflammation. colitis usually is diagnosed by a physician or other medical professional. in some cases the diagnosis may be made by a physical examination. if the diagnosis does not involve the presence (or absence) of a certain type of infection the doctor may recommend that the patient be seen by a health care provider to rule out other possible causes. if a person has a family history of colitus and has a history of other conditions such as diabetes or cancer the doctor will need to see the person to rule them out.
Expected Response: patient history diagnosis of colitis and its causes always begins with the taking of the patient's history. the information the patient provides helps the physician guide the direction for diagnosis and treatment. in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea it is important to find out when the symptoms began how long they have lasted whether they come and go and what makes them better or worse. questions may be asked about travel because infections may arise while traveling particularly in undeveloped countries. patients often ask if the cause of symptoms is food poisoning but that is often a difficult question to answer immediately. if the patient has blood with bowel movements (which in general is not normal) further questions may be explored to screen for colon cancer or polyps. food poisoning not due to bacterial infections usually does not cause blood in the stool. evaluation of the body's other systems (cardiovascular neurological) may be necesseary. physical examination once the history is taken physical examination will be helpful in determining potential causes of the symptoms. signs of more severe disease with dehydration may include orthostatic changes in blood pressure and pulse rate (decreases in the former and increases in the latter upon standing). in patients who are low on fluid or blood blood pressure and pulse may be normal when they lie flat but may change with standing; the blood pressure falls and the pulse rate rises. temperature often is checked for fever. examination of the abdomen will disclose areas of tenderness and potentially abnormal masses if tumors or crohn's disease are present. the exam also may include a rectal examination to test the stool for blood and to feel for abnormal rectal masses. in patients where ischemic colitis is a consideration the health care practitioner may examine the heart and listen for sounds of abnormal restricted blood flow (bruits) in arteries located in the neck groin and abdomen as signs of coexisting vascular disease. in patients where there is clinical suspicion of viral infection no further testing may be needed. however in a patient who appears ill dehydrated or has significant pain fever or blood in the stool more evaluation may be required. other tests blood tests may be useful to explore the possibility of anemia or low red blood cell count due to bleeding. an elevated white blood cell count may be present as the body's response to infection. however an elevated white blood cell count does not necessarily mean infection since the white cell count may be elevated as part of the body's general response to any type of inflammation. blood chemistries may be measured looking for changes in electrolyte concentrations in the body especially abnormal sodium and potassium levels that would suggest serious diarrhea or loss of fluid. kidney function may be checked by measuring the bun (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels; this may be an important clue that patients are dehydrated. as well certain bacterial causes of diarrhea may also cause kidney failure. stool samples will likely be collected for culture searching for bacterial and parasitic infections as the cause of colitis. imaging colonoscopy is a test in which a gastroenterologist uses a thin flexible tube with a fiberoptic camera attached to it to look at the inside of the colon searching for the cause of the symptoms. the appearance of the colonic lining often allows the doctor to make the diagnosis and also provides the opportunity to look for tumors and polyps. biopsies -- small bits of tissue --can be removed from the mucosal lining during colonoscopy and then evaluated under the microscope to make or confirm a diagnosis of the presence or cause of colitis. computerized tomography and barium enemas are tests that are performed by a radiologist to explore the cause of colitis but often are ordered as part of the evaluation of abdominal pain or diarrhea.

Expected Response: i checked this out for you using a pharmacist's reference. xanax and valium both common medications for anxiety are contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to risk of birth defects. also i saw a note saying this is true for most mild anti-anxiety medications. your best bet is to learn some meditative techniques like deep breathing exercises. it's physically much more difficult for you to be fearful if you are breathing deeply and slowly. you can literally trick your body out of panic by doing it. best of all it's god for the baby too. avoid stimulants before flying such as caffeine because they can help you be more nervous.

Expected Response: a wart is a harmless skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (hpv). there are more than 100 known types of hpv. hpv infects the top layer of skin usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. the virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly forming a wart. most warts go away on their own within months or years. warts can grow anywhere on the body. they are most common among children and young adults. there are five kinds of warts. they look different and form on different parts of the body. common warts grow most often on the hands but they may be anywhere on the body. they are rough shaped like a dome and gray-brown in color. plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet. they look like hard thick patches of skin with dark specks. plantar warts may cause pain when you walk and you may feel like you are stepping on a pebble. flat warts usually grow on the face arms or legs. they are small (usually smaller than the eraser on the end of a pencil) have flat tops and can be pink light brown or light yellow. filiform warts usually grow around the mouth nose or beard area. they are the same color as your skin and have growths that look like threads sticking out of them. periungual warts grow under and around the toenails and fingernails. they look like rough bumps with an uneven surface and border. they can affect nail growth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Answer: you need to talk to your insurance company for a plan that will cover your son's treatment. there are many options for children with depression. you can talk to a counselor or a registered nurse. talk to the counselor about your son and the treatment options.
Expected Response: all health plans sold through the marketplaces must cover mental health and substance abuse services. but the details of what therapies are covered can vary from plan to plan. i would recommend you spend some time evaluating the various plans available in your state and ask for assistance from "helpers" that are available through all of the marketplaces so you fully understand the options and can make the best choice for your son's health.

Question: can a tooth die due to rapid orthodontics treatment a month after braces were put on?
Answer: no. orthodomac's are not effective in preventing tooth decay.
Expected Response: there is no scientific evidence that orthodontics can "kill teeth. " if there was an endodontic or root canal problem it’s more than likely that it’s been caused by a previous cavity or trauma.

Question: what medications and treatments are available to treat bacterial vaginosis?
Answer: there are no drug interactions between antibiotics and bv. antibiotics are used to treat infection caused by a bacterial vagisum (bv) and are used in combination with other medications to treat infections caused by bv such as antibiotics that cause anemia (blood in the urine) or anemia caused by anemia. bv is caused by the bacterium bv-galactosidase (bgal) that is found in the vagina. the vagina is made up of three parts: the vagina lining the vaginal opening and the vagina wall. the lining is made of a thick mucous membrane called a vagina membrane. the vaginal wall is the lining of the vagina and the vaginal openings are called vagina walls. bgal is caused when bacteria grow in the vaginal walls of the vaginal area. when bacteria invade the vagina the vagina walls become inflamed and become infected. the inflamed vaginal walls become infected when the
Expected Response: the antibiotics metronidazole (such as flagyl metrogel) clindamycin (such as cleocin clindesse ) and tinidazole ( tindamax ) are used to treat bacterial vaginosis. depending on the antibiotic you are prescribed you may take it by mouth or use it vaginally. during pregnancy women who are high-risk for preterm labor are advised to avoid vaginal application of any treatment. some doctors recommend that all pregnant women avoid vaginal treatments. studies generally show that vaginal antibiotics are as effective as oral antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis. 9 medicines inserted into the vagina cause fewer side effects than oral medicines although they can make you vulnerable to vaginal yeast infection. when considering treatment for bacterial vaginosis ask your doctor whether you should: use oral medicine or medicine inserted into the vagina. some women prefer to take pills rather than using a vaginal medicine. avoid having sex during the time that you are being treated. continue treatment during your menstrual period. medicine placed in your vagina is more difficult to use during your period but your doctor may recommend continuing treatment during this time. avoid drinking alcohol during treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. these medicines can cause severe nausea and vomiting if you drink alcohol when you are taking one of them. clindamycin does not. the mineral oil in clindamycin cream or ovules can cause latex condoms or diaphragms to fail. this is also true for metronidazole cream and tablets (the gel is fine for use with condoms and diaphragms). don't trust barrier methods of birth control when using this type of vaginal medicine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does klonopin show up on a urine drug test? . i am taking klonopa. i have been taking it for a few days now and i am still not sure if it is safe.
Answer: hi yes it is ok to take it if you have been on it for longer than that. but if you do not have a test done then you should not be taking it. good luck
Expected Response: only if the lab drug order specifically includes it for some reason.
================================================================================
Question: could my 1-year-old's ear infection cause a high fever (103f)? . she has a fever of 103f.
Answer: hi i think its a good idea to get her checked out asap good luck
Expected Response: a fever is very non-specific -- there can be many things causing his fever but if he has an ear infection this is the most likely culprit. most ear infections are preceded by a cold so even colds can cause fevers of this magnitude but unfortunately i do not know enough about your child or his particular case to know if "something else" is going on. don't let a fever frighten you. children can get some pretty impressive fevers. medical providers rarely get excited with fevers under 105f in a one-year-old. children tend to get higher fevers because their immune system is not very good (the fever helps fight infection) and their "cooling system" is not very efficient (we cool by sweating over a large skin surface area so the smaller the body the less cooling). most fevers should improve on day three or four of the illness but if it does not or if you child is experiencing any other worrisome symptoms you will need to have him re-examined.

Question: sebaceous cyst on head has become infected. what can i do for relief til my doc appt in a week? . i have a sebaceous cyst on my head. recently it has been very sore and tender and i believe it is infected. i have an appt with a surgeon next thursday the soonest appt they had to have it removed. what can i do until then for relief? i've been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours and apply a heat pack 2 times a day. right now the pain is bad and i cannot sleep.
Answer: hi if you have a cyst like that it would be best to see your doctor for a test. but do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is circumcision like in teen years? . we've recently decided to get my 12-year-old brother circumcised because it was irritating him a lot. i was wondering what the risks would be recovery time and how painful it'll be for him? .
Answer: circumcision is not like a surgical procedure. it is very painful. there is no magic cure for circumcision. it may be a temporary fix but it is not necessary. circumcision is a lifelong commitment. it will not be permanent. you may have to go to a different doctor for the procedure.
Expected Response: remember that most of the men on this planet are not circumsized but rather just the way that nature made them. the male foreskin is just a skin covering not unlike the lips or eyelids. it does not need to be removed and whatever is causing the irritation can likely be fixed. circumcision at age 12: not likely covered by insurance; this would be considered a cosmetic procedure done under anesthesia may be general or local will be painful for several weeks following surgery risk of infection and other post-surgical complications hi don't if he has some kind of irritation is this from him not washing behind his foreskin if its to tight get him to play with his foreskin he needs to start stretching it sideways and length ways and slowly he will be able to get his foreskin back then using a seas salt water wash this will help clean and get rid of any irritations behind it. it would be far better for his later sex life if he is left intact than having a circumcision. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack or tia?
Answer: the prognostic value of tia depends on the type of the tia. the most common type of tIA is tia-associated (tia-ca) which means that the body produces antibodies that cause the taus. in tia the body can produce antibodies that block the tau protein and cause the body to produce antibodies. the body also produces antibodies to fight off the tautus virus. the immune system also produces taus that cause inflammation and pain. the tus is caused by a virus that causes taus and taus-ca. the type and severity of tias vary. for example a person may have tia that is mild and may not be severe enough to cause a taus attack. tia is more common in children than adults. it is also more common among people with other conditions such as diabetes. tias may also be caused by other conditions that can
Expected Response: a transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. up to 10% of people will experience a stroke within three months of a tia. since there is no way of predicting whether the next episode will resolve the patient needs to be educated that should symptoms occur they need to access medical care immediately. activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911 is recommended. if a stroke occurs there is a very short period of time where thrombolytic (clot dissolving) drugs [for example alteplase (tpa)] can be used to reverse a stroke. in most hospitals the drug can only be given within three hours of onset of stroke symptoms. in that three hours the patient needs to get to the hospital the diagnosis needs to be made laboratory tests and head ct scans need to be performed neurologic consultation needs to occur and the drug administered. the longer the delay the higher the risk that the drug won't work and that complications like bleeding into the brain will occur. specialized interventional radiologists can inject tpa directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. this can extend the time frame to six hours but currently this treatment is not widely available. tias should be considered the equivalent of angina of the brain. in heart disease angina is the heart pain that warns of potential heart attack. when heart muscle is damaged it cannot be replaced or repaired. similarly brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it too cannot be replaced.

Question: im pregnant and my blood pressure read 126/94 the book that comes with it says its a hypertention measure should i worry. i checked it because my hands and feet were swollen and hurt also i have a migraine with it. for the past two days i have had bodyaches ion the neck and abdomen. my blood sugar is low and i am not pregnant. i have been taking a lot of ibuprofen and am taking a couple of antihistamines. i am also taking a home pregnancy test.
Answer: hi if your on a low blood sugar then you could be pregnant but you need to take a home test. if you have a blood sugar of 140 then you would need to be on a high blood sugar diet. good luck
Expected Response: hi yes you should worry get off to you doctor for help or google natural ways out of hpb. hope this helps. good luck

Question: i have been taking penicillin for a bad tooth and forgot. i performed oral sex on my husband and now have a sore throat. some vaginal fluid was present. can i take diflucan while taking the penicillin?
Answer: you may have been misdiagnosed with an std. you can take penicillin while taking penitidine (a steroid) to prevent an std from developing.
Expected Response: hi taking antibiotics not only kills the bad bugs but also the good bugs so having oral sex was not a good idea as you have found leaves you open to picking up other bugs. once you have finished d o get on some acidophilus this gets you your good bugs back and working chuck in some yakult and you good as new. your throat could be a yeast infection either see your doctor or go to your drug store/chemist for some otc drugs. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what can be absorbed by the stomach? . what percentages of various normally consumed foods and liquids can be absorbed into the body through the stomach. while i understand that the intestines absorb most of the nutrients we consume i was lead to believe that a potion of some foods and beverages were absorbed into the body through the stomach.
Answer: yes. this is a very important question. it's important to ask yourself this question: can you absorb the nutrients you eat through the intestine opening? if you can't absorb the food you're eating through the opening then you can absorb it. but if you're not sure how much of a difference you're making then you need to ask your doctor about this.
Expected Response: the stomach does not absorb nutrients but it does play a role enhancing absorption of certain nutrients in the small intestine. for example the stomach secretes intrinsic factor which binds to b12 for absorption in the small intestine. stomach acid turns iron into a form that is better absorbed in the small intestine. and people who have part of their stomach removed may be at risk for osteoporosis because the stomach empties faster which can decrease the amount of calcium being absorbed and utilized by the body. anyone who has surgery to remove part of the stomach should see a dietitian to be sure they are not at risk for nutrition deficiencies.

Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's very frustrating. i'm not sure what you mean by "over weight" but i can tell you that it's not a bad thing. it sounds like you're losing weight. you may be losing weight because you're not eating enough. if you're eating a diet that's high in fat and calories you may have a problem with your blood sugar. if your blood
Expected Response: hi. in weight loss the first thing you should do is answer why i gained weight? . gaining weight has many areas and one of them is slow metabolism. no matter how serious you are in diet or how motivated you are to exercise if your metabolism is not working it is all useless. or perhaps you just need some nutritionist that can help you. i found this in google+ and i found out that some of us here tried this one. it is you to find out how effective is this <link>

Question: i had rhematic fever as a child. was just wondering if i need to know what effects that may have taken on my heart.? . how can rhematic fever effect your heart when you get older?
Answer: it may not be that important but i would advise you to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: i had rheumatic fever as an adult at 40 yrs old. i didn't know what it was but i was very sick for several months before i fired my md and got a new one who put me on strong antibiotics right away. at 54 yrs of age my mitral valve gave out and i had a new artificial mitral valve put in successfully. now at 57 yrs old i have congestive heart failure and the cardio docs are thinking to put in an all purpose pace maker & defibrilator because of irregular heart rates (high -afib/flutter and low). all of it is directly attributed to a congenital heart murmur which was never followed and got worse over the years. the undiagnosed rheumatic fever was the last kick over the edge. i do not have any clogged arteries because i had always taken care of myself with a vegetarian diet and exercise (hiking swimming weight lifting). i have not yet regained all of the prior strength and maybe i never will but i keep trying. it is baby steps toward progress every day

Question: my 3-year-old is taking tamiflu and i gave him benadryl because his lips were swollen. did i give him too much medicine? . i have given him 1/2 teaspoon of benadryl and he also has taken 1 teaspoon of tylenol for his fever.
Answer: you can't give a child too much medication. the only way to know for sure is to see your pediatrician.
Expected Response: i don't think you gave him too much medicine but i have to ask why you gave him benadryl for his lips. he may have swollen lips because of an irritation or possibly due to dehydration. you want to be very careful when using medications in children this young; they are not "little adults. ”

Question: my cousin has crohn's disease. she is not taking any medicine and is very stubborn. what can i do? . her crohn's disease is very severe and she is very ill. she won't take any guidance from her parents. she also switches to another doctor if the medicine doesn't work immediately. how can i help her get better?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a very serious condition. there are many different types of crohn’s disease. i'd suggest you talk to your doctor about what medications you're taking. i wish you all the best with this! i wish i could tell you that you're not alone in your struggles with crohn disease. many people have tried many different medications to treat their disease. some are effective. some may not. but many of these medications are ineffective. if you're concerned about your chances of getting better or if you have questions about your medication consult
Expected Response: hi sorry but better she will never be apart from living with it and she can only do that as you can see with its not very nice sorry but if she wont follow a doctors advice then she will die. the only way that might help her to go forward is and she probably knows it is that death is around the corner all you and do is to tell her about this corner and perhaps make it into a very long bend. do hope this helps you and her. good luck

Question: can the appendix grow back? . i have had my appendix removed back in 1989. i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good. how can that be if it was removed? is it possible it has grown back?
Answer: hi if its not just a white bump then yes it is a white lump. just think of it as a white spot. the lump is located in the abdomen. the white lump is a bit bigger than your belly button and is not a white dot. it is just a bump that is there. if you are having a hard time seeing it then see your doctor or go see your gyno. good luck
Expected Response: well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps! i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an "expert" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail.

Question: why is that my 10 year daughter is developing breast and only one of them is coming in? the other one is still flat? . she is a little underweight and has been having problems with breast cancer. she is also a little overweight.
Answer: hi so you have been having breast cancer for 10 years now your still having breast problems and this is why you have had to have a mammogram and tests to find out what's causing this? but you have not had a mammo test done and you are still having problems. but if you have a doctor do the tests. good luck
Expected Response: what is the usual time to be “developed”? lack of any breast development by age thirteen merits some monitoring. the small firm breast buds usually appear about age eleven. by age thirteen a majority of girls have the beginnings of a mound-shape of breast tissue. unless there is an overt reason for lack of development such as illness radiation exposure or hormonal problems there is evidence that breast development can continue until one’s early 20’s. while most all of us have at least some difference in size between our two breasts there are situations where the size difference is very apparent. size differences which onset in teen years will likely equalize for about 75% of women. yours jane h-h

Question: what can a mom do to get their child with mrsa in ear better. his ent is not doing much. its been ongoing for 4 months. . my 20 month old son with ear tubes is battling mrsa in his ear for 4 months. we have done massive amount of antibiotics his ent doctor says that he thinks the last chance we have is to remove his ear tube and replace it as well as remove his adenoids. im really worried that with the mrsa still present inside the ear if it is ok to have him go into surgery. how could he gotten mrsa in the first place. there has been puss coming out of my sons right ear for 4 months. his ent doesn't seem to care.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's really important you make an appointment with your ent doctor to discuss your son's case with him. there's nothing wrong with a mother getting her child with an mrsA
Expected Response: the ent does care but mrsa (assuming he has a community-acquired type and not the more-severe hospital type) is very challenging to treat. you can ask for an infectious disease consultation but your ent may be doing the best that can be done. you can also ask to see another ent for a second opinion. sometimes we have no idea where the infection came from but we do know it came from people. some people are carriers and do not know it. some kids get it in day-care now. i can understand your frustrations so the only thing you can do is try to get his evaluation and treatment to a higher level but getting a second opinion or adding an infectious disease specialist to the treatment team.

Question: what is the difference between nexium and kapidex?
Answer: nexia is a generic name for an anti-depressant. kapidem is a brand name for a prescription medication.
Expected Response: nexium and kapidex (now called dexilant) are both within the same drug class. they are proton pump inhibitors which aid in the decrease of acid production to prevent and/or treat gerd and certain ulcers. they are made by different companies but work very similarly having similar drug interactions and side effect profiles.

Question: can you help with condylox genital warts treatment and side effects? . hi i have used the treatment for the 3days twice a day and now it is sore swollen the skin in white with little open skin marks where warts used to be. also it is a little smelly. is this normal? . the warts appear to have gone but i can't even wipe myself properly once been to the toilet although it doesnt hurt when i do go. i hope you can help. good luck
Expected Response: the most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation. assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods. the chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue. this can appear burned white or even black. this is expected. soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated.

Question: if a person is taking klonopin but cannot afford it is it better to request lexapro or pristiq from the doctor?
Answer: this is a good question. it is important to ask the doctor about your medical history. you will need to make an appointment with your primary care provider to get this information.
Expected Response: neither lexapro nor pristiq is in the same class as klonopin. you would need to talk to your health-care professional to determine which medication would be best for you.

Question: how can i manage swelling in my feet and legs during pregnancy?
Answer: swelling in the feet and ankles is common in women but not always. swelling in both feet and feet is not caused by a common cold. if you have a cold you may have swelling in your feet. if your symptoms are not related to a cold or if you are having any symptoms that may be related to an infection you should seek immediate medical attention.
Expected Response: i don't know and would like to.

Question: will penicelin cure an uti?
Answer: hi ok so you have had an utis and you have been given penicillin and a lot of pain meds and you are taking penicillins for it. but you have taken peniciline and a few days later you have a uti and you need to take penicel. the problem is you have not taken peniline. penicilli is a drug that works by blocking the production of a specific type of bacteria called prostaglandins. so if you take penal or penicillus penicile is not working. and if you have peniculitis you may have a urinary tract infection. so you need a urinary antibiotic. but if you are having a utis then you may need to see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: a urinary tract infection (uti ) is a bacterial infection so an antibiotic is an effective treatment. penicillin specifically may be used to treat a uti but the choice of medication sometimes is based on the specific bacteria causing the infection. it's important not to try to self-diagnose a uti. only a urine sample can confirm the presence of bacteria. many of the symptoms of uti such as pain or burning with urination (peeing) can be caused by other things. that's why it's important to see a health care provider for an examination if you think you may have a urinary tract infection. it's also important never to self-treat conditions like this. never use "leftover" antibiotics (you should never have any leftover antibiotics; it's extremely important to take every pill in the bottle whenever an antibiotic is prescribed) to treat a cold flu or any other problem such as when you think you might have a uti. misuse of antibiotics in this way can lead to the development of "superbugs" that are resistant to treatment. if you think you have a uti i urge you to see a health care provider for a simple urine test. that way you'll be on the right path toward treatment. best to you!

Question: i have been getting positive ovulation tests but late temperature rise (~8 days after) in some cycles. is this normal? . i have been trying to get pregnant since about 10 months now. in about 4 cycles i have had an issue with ovulation testing. in these months although i get positive opk test around calendar date 15-17 (which is when i normally get it) my temperature doesn't rise until about a week after. is this normal? in other cycles i get a temperature rise a day or two after positive ovulation test. i always get my period 16 days after the temperature rise. . thanks!
Answer: hi if you have had your period for 4 months then its the same as your period. the only way to get your period back is to get tested again and get a test done again. good luck
Expected Response: hi so you know how your cycle works yes day 1 being first day of your period well day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day so you need to have unprotected sex around day <negative_smiley>9 it takes male sperm 3 days to reach your womb and sperm can live in you womb for up to 10 days max. so you ovulate after the sperm will be there waiting. if you get spotting around day 21 then you should be pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck. ps look throw away the test kits just leave it to nature relax take a deep breath your get pregnant when your body is ready outside of that get a sperm test done you never know?

Question: how long would it take cancer to develop after hpv exposure?
Answer: it depends on the type of cancer and the type and duration of the cancer. if it is a localized type of leukemia or lymphoma it may take several months to develop. if you have hpv and you are not exposed to hpv you may develop a small number of small cancers. if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body it may be more difficult to develop the cancer in your area. if your cancer is spread to a person's skin it may not be possible to develop it in your skin.
Expected Response: exposure to an infectious disease like hpv does not imply that you will even get it. even if you develop hpv there is no certainty that you will develop a cancer many many years later but your risk is definitely higher.
================================================================================
Question: i've been dealing with kidney stones for 4 years now. what should i add or remove from my diet to avoid them?
Answer: you need to be careful with your diet because stones can form in the kidneys and can cause kidney stones. some stones can be caused by the kidneys. if you are concerned about stones you should talk to your doctor.
Expected Response: the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if you’re drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones -- the most common type -- eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones.

Question: why is my gf so sensitive that when i touch her anywhere she gets uncomfortable & loses any desire to get intimate? . when we get intimate my girlfriend sometimes loses all arousal because when i touch her it feels uncomfortable on her skin--she has also never had an orgasm. if we move too fast at first it hurts her (even with lubricant) but if i increase foreplay she loses arousal because touching her body anywhere makes it uncomfortable for her. she is very sensitive and very sensitive about touching herself. she has been doing this for a long time.
Answer: hi if you google this you will find lots of info on it its from the uk's nhs. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: only your girlfriend could possibly answer this question but clearly she is having some issues associated with your sexual intimacy. there can be many reasons and some may be deeply private. for instance if she had a past experience that was troubling to her like a prior molestation she may have difficulty. she could have some underlying fears of getting pregnant getting an std or she may be just frightened about sex. if possible she may benefit from discussing this with a counselor or you can try talking with her. i would suggest that you be very gentle and understanding and not push her to be more sexually involved than she is comfortable doing. back off for a while and allow her more time. go slow.

Question: it’s sunday and my 3 year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?
Answer: there are no emergency rooms or urgent care clinics in the u. s. and most of the emergency rooms are emergency rooms.
Expected Response: i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an “ear infection” is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the “middle ear. ” the medical term for this is “otitis media ” sometimes called “acute otitis media” to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasn’t been congested it probably isn’t an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you don’t necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isn’t thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isn’t super-miserable it’s ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what they’re feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.

Question: why do i feel a burning sensation in my mouth when i have oral sex with my girlfriend? . when my girlfriend and i started dating we were both virgins. when we have oral sex i feel a burning sensation in my mouth that really hurts. this has only happened the last two times we participated in this sexual act. i have had oral sex with her numerous times in the past. her vagina smells different but not bad. both her and i have noticed the change in smell. we have only been sexually active for about 3-5 months she feels no itching or burning on her side of her mouth.
Answer: hi your find this sounds like it could be a yeast infection but it is not that simple. it could just be a cold sore. good luck
Expected Response: something has changed. since you were both virgins when you started it could be assumed that you were both free of disease and safe for each other. this changes as soon as one partner is unfaithful to the other and creates the potential for diseases to come into the relationship. maybe you should both see a doctor about this.

Question: in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're suffering from a metabolic syndrome (metastatic syndrome). a metabolic disorder is a condition in which the body produces too much of a chemical or nutrient imbalance. this imbalance can lead to heart disease or even death. the body's metabolism can be slow and inefficient. it's not uncommon for a person to have a metabolic condition that's caused by a metabolic disease. it can also be caused by
Expected Response: the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg white more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.

Question: my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day. is it possible that she is dehydrated?

Question: is it safe to take ibuprofen with vicodin? or is tylenol safer?
Answer: ibuprophen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it is used to treat pain in the joints and muscles. it is also used for pain control. it does not interact with any medications.
Expected Response: please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: spleen has been crushed & you are bleeding out inside your body how is it possible pure blood comes out of your penis? . blood was coming out of my penis due to a fall where my spleen is it did not cut open my body. i was told that when they opened me up 2+ liters of blood inside me. i'm just curious as to how that blood could manage to come out of my penis. it was only about 5 minutes after i fell & i was able to get up and go to the bathroom & nothing but blood came out of my penis. no one so far has been able to give me an answser as to how this could happen. thanks for any help on this vexing question.
Answer: hi its not just blood coming out your penis is also getting blood in your urine and urine can also get blood in urine if you have a cold it can also cause blood in the urine. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: the spleen is on the same side as your left kidney so one possible explanation for hematuria (blood in the urine) would be a contusion of the kidney with bleeding. free blood in the abdominal cavity from a ruptured spleen would not anatomically be able to get into your "closed" urinary system so i suspect that your injury was not completely limited to your spleen.

Question: i am 17 and sexually active and i've been having some vaginal discomfort recently. recently my vagina have been itching like crazy and a little puffy almost like its swollen and accompanied by burning while urinating and a yellowish discharge with a slight odour. i am not getting any abdominal pain. can this be a yeast infection? . what are some remedies? . are there over the counter drugs?
Answer: hi as you have been having vaginal discomfort its not a yeast problem its just a yeast thing. good luck
Expected Response: go to a gynaecologist immediately if you know the person you have been sexually active with speak to them about their medical problems and maybe bring them to the gynaecologist because they could have something they may not know about. you are experience inflammation discolouration which can be caused by cysts forming on the vaginal wall either from a cut friction burn (are you lubing or just dry balling it) which can get infected. odour is normal in private areas it is just bacteria forming in a humid moist area proper cleaning can fix that but if it smells sickening then it could be harmful bacteria. you could have a urinal tract condition which effects the urinary tract system which could be seen with blood in your pee. make sure you clean it thoroughly before visiting a gynaecologist avoid anymore intercourse with people as you may spread it is possible your partner or partners may be carriers meaning they do not show symptoms similar to yours.

Question: anorexic girl recovers but she still thinks she is fat she gained 10 lbs can she become anorexic again?
Answer: hi yes it is possible but it is not a good idea to get pregnant if you are having unprotected sex and the condom broke it would not be the best thing for you. but you could try a pregnancy test and see if you get pregnant again. good luck
Expected Response: she can become anorexic again in a flash so it is very very important that she be weighed carefully (many anorexics know how to "trick" the scale) on a weekly basis and be under medical supervision.

Question: what causes warts?
Answer: the most common causes of warts are skin infections or bacterial vaginosis. these can be caused by many things but they are not all of the same. skin infections are usually caused by a fungus. bacterial vagins are caused by an infection of the vaginal opening. warts can be a sign of a sexually-transmitted disease (staph) or a sexually transmitted disease (std). if you have an std or are pregnant you may be at higher risk for getting warts.
Expected Response: warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv) which enters the skin and causes cells to multiply rapidly. usually warts spread through direct contact. each person responds differently and not everyone exposed to hpv will develop a wart.

Question: can a male that is infected with hepatitis c transfer it to a female that is uninfected through sexual contact?

Question: period after lifting. i am 25. my last pap was 2 years ago it was normal. the past 2 months i have done moderate lifting. every time i lift something my period starts instantly and lasts about a week. my period is bright red with an odor. i have a pain that feels like pressure on my uterus. i am not pregnant. i am moderately active. i jog 2 miles a day and on my feet 6hours a day. i only bleed when i lift something. both my grandma and aunt have had hysterectomies in their early 30s due to endometriosis. i don't know if i should have any more tests done.
Answer: hi have you thought of a test for endometritis? if so then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: hi i found this piece of info it may help you. endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes painful or heavy periods. it often causes pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) pelvis or lower back. it may also lead to lack of energy depression and fertility problems. however the symptoms of endometriosis can vary and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all. if your gp suspects that you have endometriosis they will refer you to a gynaecologist (specialist in the female reproductive system). the gynaecologist may carry out an examination of your fallopian tubes ovaries and womb known as a laparoscopy to check for patches of endometriosis. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?
Answer: hi if you have had the concerta for 10 years then you should be ok now its a very good medicine and it works for a few things. it will help you with your anxiety and depression. good luck
Expected Response: seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.

Question: is sudafed pe for sinus headache safe for pregnant women? . i am a healthy female with a healthy diet and a healthy immune system. i am not taking any drugs or anything that could cause me to get sick. i have no other symptoms. i just have a headache and i am nauseous. i don't have any other symptoms at all.
Answer: hi try this its a good place to start. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: before using over-the-counter products during pregnancy it is especially important to talk to your ob-gyn and/or your pharmacist. pain relievers such as acetaminophen are generally safe during pregnancy and may help with sinus headaches. if congestion is a major issue it is safest to use a nasal spray that works locally rather than taking a pill that will travel throughout your system. talk with your health care professional before taking anything while pregnant.

Question: i rode a train 12 hrs ago & now feel dizzy & feel like i am still on it. is this motion sickness? and will it go away?
Answer: hi if you have been having this problem for a long time then yes this is a very serious problem. try and get to the bottom of it. good luck
Expected Response: you may have a condition called mdd (mal de debarquement) a type of vertigo that occurs after an individual gets off a boat usually a cruise lasting several days but it could happen from this 12-hour train trip. people describe the imbalance symptoms as a rocking boat worse when you stand still or lie down. these annoying symptoms can last months or can fade relatively fast. it is more common in women between the ages of 40-50. unfortunately most medications that work for other forms of dizziness (meclizine scopolamine) do not work very well for mdd. valium (diazepam) and the antidepressant drug amitriptyline has been used with limited success. these drugs help block or suppress those aberrant inner ear signals that are causing those symptoms and help with the associated anxiety. vestibular rehabilitation therapy has also been shown to be effective if your symptoms are lasting a long time. since there are many many other medical causes for imbalance and vertigo your first step is to be properly evaluated by an ent specialist.

Answer: hi if you google clomida and you find that it is a hormone it would be best to see your doctor and have a test done. good luck
Expected Response: in many cases unexplained infertility is associated with an age-related decline in fertility. unlike sperm that are being made continuously eggs are all made before a woman is born. as a woman ages her eggs age which results in embryos that make mistakes in cell division more often. this causes more unrecognized miscarriages (infertility) recognized miscarriages and down's syndrome as women age. the average age that women show up complaining of unexplained infertility is around 34-36 years old. for this reason a common theme in counteracting the age-related decline in fertility is increasing the number of eggs that a woman recruits each month. clomid is a drug that corrects some ovulation problems and it also occasionally increases the number of eggs that a woman recruits. it is a fairly safe and inexpensive first step. however many women will eventually need to use gonadotropins (fsh) to increase the number of eggs. this is call controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and can be followed by intercourse insemination or oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer. the differences between these therapies is the probability of success each month the risk of multiple gestation or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the cost of the therapy. your doctor can help you navigate these options.

Question: how does smoking affect my skin?
Answer: smoking is a very common habit among some smokers. it is not a health problem. but it can cause skin irritation and irritation of the skin. smoking can also cause skin cancer.
Expected Response: smoking is a very unhealthy habit to start in your lifetime. not only can using tobacco products cause cancer and heart disease but it can also affect the complexion of your skin and cause you to age prematurely. the byproducts found in tobacco products deprive the skin of oxygen and vital nutrients. this deprivation can lead to a pale and uneven skin tone. if you begin smoking at a young age changes in your skin can begin to be seen early on. there are more than 4 000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke; many of these harmful chemicals encourage the destruction of collagen and the elasticity of the skin. even being around secondhand smoke can cause deeper wrinkles and sagging of the skin. now let's discuss how smoking physically affects the appearance of your face and body. smoking loosens the skin around the eyes causing deep wrinkles and crow's feet. deep lines and wrinkles can also develop around the mouth from dragging on your cigarette; this look is also known as the "smoker's pucker. " your breasts can also begin to droop and fall prematurely. the skin on the back of your upper arms can also start to sag. you are also more prone to develop age spots (liver spots) on the face and body. your fingers and fingernails can begin to turn yellow or brown after years of smoking; however these stains will begin to fade after you quit smoking. smoking also increases your chances to develop alopecia (hair loss). now that you know how the use of tobacco products affects can your appearance let's look at some of the benefits of quitting smoking. once you quit smoking your circulation improves; this leads to an increased amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the skin. some of the damage from smoking can be reversed by using retinoids antioxidants (such as a and c vitamins) and chemical peels. make an appointment with your dermatologist to see what skin-care regimen is best for you. here are some overall health benefits that come with the cessation of smoking. after 20 minutes your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. after 24 hours your risk of a heart attack begins to drop. after a few weeks the cilia will begin to sweep impurities from the lungs again. after a year you decrease your risk of a heart attack by half. if you want to quit smoking and you are having trouble consult your physician.

Question: is every pharmacy able to compound medications for my child?
Answer: there are no drug companies that are able to make medications for your child. there are several different types of medications that you can take for your children.
Expected Response: this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patient’s condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local children’s hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.

Question: is a flotation pod (containing 150 gallons of water & 1000 pounds of epsom salt) safe for a person with kidney disease? . i made an appointment for a session in a sensory deprivation pod which contains 150 gallons of water mixed with 1000 pounds of epsom salt. after i made the appointment they sent me a form to fill out stating either i don't have kidney disease or i understand the risks to me. i do have kidney disease. but it was my understanding that the epsom salt would not be absorbed through my skin. i'm not sure if i should have gotten this pod filled out or not.
Answer: the eucerin is safe to drink. it is safe for you to drink as long as you are taking the correct dose of eucerine. i am sorry but i cannot recommend eucerines for kidney disease because they are not recommended for use in a pod. i suggest you call your health care provider and ask for a consultation with a pod
Expected Response: there are many types of kidney disease so unfortunately i don't really have any information about your kidney issues in order to be able to comment. my suggestion is for you to consult your nephrologist or primary care medical provider first -- someone who knows your medical history. epsom salt deprivation chambers are likely to be just fine and you are correct. you will not absorb anything through your skin. you certainly will not be drinking it!

Question: can hpv lay dormant in your system and for how long? . can the virus lay dormant in your system and not show up for years later! im married and have been with the same partner for the last 4 years and all my paps have come back normal until now. this concerns me.
Answer: hi i think your find your answer is the same as above but this could be a virus or some other. but your find the answer is you have a virus. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're dealing with an abnormal pap smear result. before i get to your questions about hpv let's back up for just a moment. an abnormal pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have human papillomavirus (hpv). the pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. an abnormal pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. in fact most abnormal pap test results are not cancer at all. certainly hpv can cause cervical cancer. however you need to receive a special test (not unlike a pap test actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for hpv. in answer to your question hpv is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. the centers for disease control estimate as many as 50% of sexually active men and women get hpv at some point in their lives. often people who are infected with it have no symptoms. so while it's not exactly true to say hpv can lie dormant in your system it is accurate to say you can be infected with hpv and live with it for many years without knowing it. your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal pap test result with you. when that happens you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about hpv. i hope you find this response helpful!

Question: how is drug-induced hair loss treated?
Answer: drug-related hair loss is often treated with a combination of medications. some of these medications are: famcet (fucosapentaenoic acid) is a combination medication that is used to treat hair loss. it is used for the treatment of hair loss that is caused by the common cold. famcét is used as a combination drug for the common flu. famcaet is used in combination with famcets for the prevention of heart disease. famcoquinone is a drug that is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it is also used to prevent heart disease by reducing inflammation of the arteries. famcan is used with famcoquis for the relief of pain caused by arthritis. famxil is a medication that may be used to reduce the severity of pain in the joints of the hands and feet. famzine is used during pregnancy for the management of the symptoms of pregnancy
Expected Response: it's important to review any medications you take and discuss their potential side effects with your doctor and pharmacist. when hair loss does occur from a drug you're taking there is a good chance that the hair will grow back on its own after you stop taking the medication. if stopping the drug does not improve hair thinning you may need to be treated with finasteride (propecia) or minoxidil (rogaine) medications that slow hair loss and can stimulate new hair growth. one technique may help prevent hair loss during chemotherapy. it's called scalp hypothermia and it involves placing ice packs on the scalp a few minutes before -- and for about a half-hour after -- chemotherapy treatment. cooling the scalp reduces blood flow to the hair follicles making it harder for the chemotherapy drugs to get into the follicular cells. cooling also reduces biochemical activity making the hair follicles less susceptible to damage from chemotherapy drugs. one concern with this technique is the risk of cancer recurrence in the scalp. after chemotherapy treatment the hair usually grows back in very quickly but it may change in texture. in rare cases the hair will stay thin even after treatment has been stopped. minoxidil can help regrow hair that is slow to return. some chemotherapy patients wear a wig or hat to hide their hair loss until their hair grows back.

Question: contagious period for cold. i have been sick with a cold off and on for about 2 months. the last time i got sick was about week ago. i am going to visit my sister and her newborn. is it safe to do so?
Answer: hi if you get a cold the only way you can get pregnant is if you have a cold. but if you are pregnant then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: a cold only lasts a week so i am concerned that you have been sick for two months. you are either getting back to back colds or there is another reason for your symptoms. since i have no way of knowing exactly what you have or when you contracted your "cold" i really cannot tell you if you are contagious or not. well avoid meeting a newborn if you are down with cold and cough as it is highly contagious. we advise to take curcuma with tinospora powder daily to increase your immunity. steam inhalation will help you get rid of viral infection. in warmth cold virus cannot survive.

Question: can allergy shots affect sexual function? . i've recently started experiencing difficulty reaching an orgasm. i am on hrt and 57 years old. i am trying to narrow down what might be the cause and the only change i have made has been in starting allergy shots at the first of the year. . . . this may be a reach in my thinking. i have been unable to reach my ob/gyn doctor to ask her questions and the information online with regard to sexually active older women is almost non-existent. men apparently rate #1. .
Answer: hi yes you can get a shot at the same time as you get your period. but if your not on the pill then you could try getting a shot before you get pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i have never heard that allergy shots would have any adverse sexual side-effects. as a matter of fact i do not think it would be medically possible for this to ever happen. see your ob-gyn for a consultation. if there is a discoverable cause for your inorgasmia it will not be your allergy shots.

Expected Response: trichomoniasis is sexually-transmitted so one or both of you had it. perhaps as long as a year or more. your risky sexual practices did not cause trich. it was contracted by contact with someone who had it not likely from sex toys or vaginal-anal sex (this can transmit colon bacteria to the vagina and cause a urinary tract infection or vaginitis). hi! partner in the last year but how many before? the trouble with tric is you can get and then it hide deep in tissue so it could be from a previous partner? you will only know many you have had that's not a put down nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite. but in future just go from vaginal to anal never back or the other way round. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: can i use triamcinolon cream for a yeast infection?
Answer: triamcolon cream is a very effective treatment for yeast infections. it is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory cream that is also very effective. it can be used in combination with other anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. it should not be used with other medications.
Expected Response: no this is a steroid cream. you need an anti-yeast medication available over-the-counter at the pharmacy. while mild steroids like hydrocortisone can help itching this steroid is a bit too strong for this sensitive area and can actually make a yeast infection worse so get the proper medication like monistat or a store-brand generic equivalent. your pharmacist can help you select one.

Question: does taking beta blockers affect heart rate during exercise?
Answer: if you are taking beta blocker-only therapy for a heart condition such as congestive heart failure (cfs) you should not take it unless you are physically capable of doing so. if you do not have a heart disease or are taking a medication that is not compatible with beta blockers you should talk to your doctor about whether or not you should take the medication. if your doctor has prescribed you beta blockers for a condition such a heart attack or stroke you should discuss this with your doctor. if beta blockers do not help prevent heart disease in people with diabetes or heart disease talk to their doctor about taking them.
Expected Response: beta blockers will slow your heart rate. therefore when you're swimming or doing any kind of physical activity or exertion your heart rate will not increase much as it did when you were off the meds. it's a whole different experience. now that shouldn't stop you from doing your activities. you just cannot use the heart rate range rules to see if you're getting the caloric or fat burn you want. or if you're an athlete on a beta blocker the same holds. you can't use your heart rate to determine your overall activity efficiency or performance.

Expected Response: as soon as you can be 100% sure of gender is when they are born. before that you do have to rely on the skill and experience of the ultrasound technician. six weeks is a little early to offer a definitive answer (we used to affectionately call this "weiner hunting") so be patient. your baby will either be a boy or a girl. there is nothing you can do to change it now.

Question: my breathing (asthma) has sharply worsened since an office renovation. what is the recommended treatment?
Answer: the most important treatment for a severe headache is a combination of medications. the most common combination is acetaminophen (tylenol) and ibuprofen (fenafil) which are both pain relievers. the combination of ibupropion (acetaminophen) and acetaminol (tyloxacin) is a pain reliever that is also known as a "susceptible" type of medication. the acetaminopa (tylic acid) and tylenol (acetyl) medications are pain relieving medications that are used to treat severe headache. acetaminopropion is a more potent pain reliever than acetaminobenadine (tyltryptamine) and it is also used to relieve some of the symptoms of a migraine. the use of acetaminoacetate (tylas) or tylenoline (tyle
Expected Response: strong odors from new paint and particulates from construction dust can irritate the airway leading to an increase in symptoms. patients sometimes need an adjustment to their asthma and nasal regimens until these irritants settle down. i would visit with your doctor about your symptoms so they can be better managed. in many cases after awhile the increase in therapy can be switched back to your regular routine. if you experience nasal congestion from the exposures a trial of prescription nasal atrovent may also be beneficial.

Answer: yes. muscle is a very important part of the penis. the muscles that control the erection are the muscles on the penis that control how much fluid passes through the penis and how much pressure is exerted on the area. muscle that controls the penis can be very sensitive to changes in temperature or humidity. muscles that regulate the erection can be sensitive to changing temperature or moisture levels. muscle on the shaft of the shaft can be affected by changing temperature humidity or humidity levels. muscles on penis can also be affected because of changes in the environment. muscles can be damaged by the sun or the weather. muscles may be damaged when the penis becomes damaged by drugs or by a traumatic injury.

Question: can i become dependent on halcion? . i am a male and i am on a low dose of prednisone. i have a lot of anxiety and depression. i am also very self-conscious about my body and my health.
Answer: you are not alone. you can become dependent upon the use of prednid. you should talk to your health care provider about this. you will need to see a doctor to determine if you need to be switched to a different medication.
Expected Response: halcion is a medication that has been used in the past to treat insomnia and you can become dependent on it. it has a special code on it which means that there are special laws that the pharmacist has to follow and the doctor has to follow when they write for something like this. as far as dependency how do we judge what dependency really means? dependency would mean that if you stop taking the medication you would experience withdrawal effects which means that you would be -- maybe have the shakes. this particular medication doctors need to monitor closely to make sure that you are not on it all the time. a lot of people are on it for maybe 7-14 days. so it shouldn't be something that should be prescribed every single day every single night for a longer period of time. there are newer medications like lunesta like ambien that have better medication profiles as far as side effects. we would rather see you on something like that instead because of the fact that they have decrease side effects. won't make you as tired won't cause falls in the home; especially for the elderly patient halcion we really don't want to use that drug because it has been shown that they can fall out of bed sometimes on it. so once again we have got to be really carefully about the choices that we make and once again talk to your pharmacist about concerns questions side effects and possibly we would refer you back to your physician or healthcare provider. for instance if you find a medication that works for you and you don't have as many side effects that's the key. that's what we want to do. we want to make sure that you are having the best quality of life.

Expected Response: sooboob. i've got the same symptoms & spent a week in one hospital & a week later a week at another hospital while dr. s were trying to figure out what was causing the extreme nausea that was sooo forceful it made me dry heave but never a true vomiting. the only thing they found after extensive examining with every kind of mri ultrasound ct scan & lab u can think of. was a golfball size tumor in the center of my liver. i've read several threads of people with tumors in their liver that claim to have the same symptoms & their dr. would never attribute the symptoms to the tumor. i had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago & started having the nausea april of last yr & the pain started as an occasional pain. similar to the gallbladder pain but grew in intensity & frequency over a several month period. i'm a woman & notice that the pain is at it's peek a week before my cycle starts (pms) & during my cycle then it subsides to tolerable & the nausea increases to intolerable. they take turns ruining my day lol. hope this isn't what's wrong with u but your symptoms are the same as mine & all the dr's i've seen are too eager to hand me the ibs med & nexium. however the meds make the pain worse.

Question: will eating turkey help me sleep?
Answer: turkey is a great meal for your body. it is high in protein and low in fat. it's also high in fiber and low sugar. turkey is also high-fiber and low-fat. you can find turkey at the grocery store.
Expected Response: well there’s a big myth about turkey okay so turkey does have l-tryptophan in it. you’d have to eat about a 46 pound turkey to get enough tryptophan in your system to for it to make a difference and the truth of the matter is that tryptophan doesn’t work particularly well in the presence of protein. so it doesn’t really work. there’s just as much tryptophan in beef and pork so if you eat a big thanksgiving meal it’s not what’s making you sleepy is not the turkey. it’s probably the preparations and the lack of sleep you got the night before getting the meal ready that’s actually making you tired.

Expected Response: there are no "side effects" (like impotency) from masturbation. face down face up face sideways or hanging upside down. i began masturbating as a small child. i didn't know anybody else did it but decided it was wrong and kept trying to stop! anyhow i did it lying on my stomach and it was many years before i read that doing it that way could be bad for one but i don't remember why unless it was too much pressure on the penis. eventually i learned that masturbation in general was not only not immoral depending on the circumstances but it took me a long time to learn to do it lying on my back but it was something i rarely did until after my wife died. hi the problem by ding this is when it comes to real sex you may not have the sensitivity that you should have this stems from dry masturbating and dry masturbating is not good for you you could end up with scars on your gland so take a break for a couple of weeks the start masturbating with some kind of oil baby oil will do the using you hand start masturbating slowly with a featherlight touch not a hard grip masturbating should have the same touch as the inside if a vagina this way when it comes to real sex your brain will know just how it should feel. good luck usually when masturbating the only side effect is stomach cramp

Question: as an asthmatic taking the bus a lot i'm around 2nd hand smoke so much that my asthma is worsening. mask recommendation. i want to know if there is a mask i can wear while waiting for the bus when i can't get away from smokers. i went online searching and couldn't find anything. all the websites i visited said it was impossible to really filter the cigarette smoke completely. so is there a mask that will do a fairly good job? maybe i can wear two of those masks at the same time to better help myself. thank you.
Answer: it sounds like you need to use a mask. the main thing is to get your lungs filled with oxygen. it sounds as though you are having difficulty breathing because you are getting out of breath. you can try some non-smoker masks that will help you.
Expected Response: i wear a 3m 8210 respirator n95 mask. have used it when i was a painter and also working on the farm in all the dust. also have sometimes put a damp kleenex inside it for further relief.

Answer: no. the bone density tests are not recommended for women with mammograms.
Expected Response: no those tests will not cause hair loss. people do lose hair from time to time (hair that is in the "resting stage") so any loss is likely to be just a coincidence.

Question: what level of spf should one use on a daily basis?
Answer: spf is a measure of the amount of fat in the body. it is the percentage of fat that is absorbed from the body through the body's metabolism. the amount you eat is also a factor. if you are taking a daily allowance of calories you may want to consider a lower level of fat such as a low-fat diet or a low carb diet.
Expected Response: you should use a minimum spf a 15 but even more importantly than that you can even go higher to a 30 or up to a 50. i think beyond that it doesn't make much difference. but the most important thing is to reapply it every few hours because whether or not you are out there swimming sweating or rubbing it off it wears off over time and it gets degraded by the sun exposure itself. so you have to apply enough product but also reapply it often enough in order to maintain that protection. don't forget to put it on your neck and your chest because those are areas that are exposed. if you are wearing a scoop neck or a v-neck and you are just walking around it's incidental sun exposure. the sun exposure is cumulative. your skin remembers that first exposure as a child and that's been building up building up building up in your skin and eventually it crosses a threshold when you hit your; it could be in your 20s 30s 40s or beyond depending on your skin type and how much exposure you have had where all of a sudden it starts to show. both as signs of aging and even worse signs of skin cancer.

Question: what candy can i eat with type 1 diabetes. i have type 1 and i have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. my doctor said i should eat with a sugar tolerance of at least 80 mg/dl. i am not sure if i should be eating with a tolerance of 80 mg. i'm not sure how to treat my diabetes.
Answer: it sounds like you're taking a very low-carbohydrate diet. if you're not eating a lot of sugar you probably are eating a very high-fiber diet. however it sounds as though you're eating a low-fat diet. you may need to see your doctor for a blood test to check for type 2. if your doctor doesn't prescribe a blood sugar test you may be able to eat a low fat diet. there are many things you can do to help control your diabetes. first you should discuss your symptoms with your doctor. if it's a mild episode that lasts only a few days you may want to see a health
Expected Response: hi found you this on www. diabetes. org. myth: people with diabetes can't eat sweets or chocolate. fact: if eaten as part of a healthy meal plan or combined with exercise sweets and desserts can be eaten by people with diabetes. they are no more "off limits" to people with diabetes than they are to people without diabetes. the key to sweets is to have a very small portion and save them for special occasions so you focus your meal on more healthful foods. hope this helps you. good luck

Answer: hi you should have seen your doctor and get checked out for a pregnancy test. good luck
Expected Response: yes its always possible if you had unprotected sex and your late you could be they say its not always a sure thing to take a hpt the first day of your peroid tests like clear blue are normaly on the money cramping can be from the egg attaching itself inside you. i would say try another test in a few days see what that tells you if still a neg. call you gyn and let her know and im sure she can tell you if its something to worry about. also bare in mind that if you did have sex and your having pain in your side you could be having a tube pregnancy which means the egg has attached itself to you tube rather than making its way into where it belongs and that can be a very bad thing so like i siad hold off a few days but if the pain worsens call your doctor asap hope this helps

Answer: hi just google natural ways out of pain and stiffness. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. pain issues can negatively impact a person's quality of life and in your case you've had to reduce your running because of it. if it's been a year since you last saw the doctor about this it's time to go back. for one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel. for another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it re-checked. many conditions can cause the pains you've described. anything from sciatica to worn cartilage in the joints to arthritis could be the culprit. if you don't feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion. i wish you all the best!

Question: how to get rid of the poison ivy rashes? . although i thought i was being careful when cutting down some poison ivy in by backyard i now have it. itching is under control but can anyone help on getting rid of the rashes or do i just wait it out? got it 5 days ago. it is also spreading to my surprise. i read that it would only spread from the original toxic oils from the plant not after exposure. i'm not even very itchy but every day have a new patch of rashes.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i wish you all the best with this! it sounds like you've been exposed to a poison ivvy. you may have gotten it from a contaminated area. the first thing to do is to see your health-care provider for an examination. it's not uncommon to have a rash that looks like it may have been from a plant. you should be able to tell if you're exposed to
Expected Response: you are correct about it appearing to spread based on your original exposure. you may have been exposed by the oils on your clothing or shoes that you touched later or by some of the tools you used to cut it down. the oleoresin is so stable that it can last on objects for years so you better carefully wash any clothing or objects that may have become contaminated. if you have a dog and dog came in contact with poison ivy the oil can be on the fur so wash the dog too. in my opinion there is no such thing as a mild case of poison ivy so i tend to treat them more aggressively (based on my own childhood experience of the misery it causes). prescription prednisone topical steroids and oral antihistamines is the treatment of choice so it is time to consult a medical provider.

Question: what is consider a diabete if your have low sugar level to be 44 then goes up to 67. is this considered a diabetic?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's hard to tell when you're talking about a diabetes but it's important to remember that there are many different types of diabetes. some people are more prone to developing diabetes than others. if you're overweight or obese you may have a higher risk of developing diabetes. if your diabetes is not considered a diabetes you should talk to your doctor about whether you should be taking a diabetes medication or not. you can talk to a doctor about the best way to treat diabetes. you may also talk to someone about whether or not you should take a diabetes medicine. it may help you to feel better about your diabetes and to see if it's better for you to take a medication that's right for you. if it doesn't work for you talk to the doctor about what you can do
Expected Response: to diagnose diabetes your doctor may do a fasting blood glucose test. this is a preferred method since it’s easy to do and less expensive than other tests but you have to refrain from eating anything for at least 8 hours priors to testing. also it is normal for your blood sugar to go up after eating. fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 99mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 100 – 125mg/dl diabetic – greater than 126mg/dl non-fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 139mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 140 – 199mg/dl diabetic – greater than 200mg/dl the standard diagnosis of diabetes is made when at least two separate blood tests show that your blood sugar is elevated. based on the information you provided it appears that you have a low blood glucose value. i would actually review this article about hypoglycemia or low blood sugar ( <link> ) since your blood sugar was initially very low on this occasion. keep in mind that even a normal blood glucose test with risk factors (listed here: <link> ) may warrant further testing. it would be best to discuss with your doctor if you have further questions.
================================================================================
Question: what are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes recently diagnosed?
Answer: symptoms of diabetes often begin with the onset of symptoms but can last a long time. symptoms may include: nausea vomiting fatigue or pain in the legs.
Expected Response: your (or your child's) symptoms of type 1 diabetes probably developed quickly over a few days to weeks. these symptoms are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia) and include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. if your child has already learned to use the toilet he or she may have started wetting the bed during naps or at night. the kidneys are trying to get rid of the excess sugar in the blood. in order to do that they have to excrete more water. more water means more urine. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. this happens if you lose through frequent urination enough water to become dehydrated. weight loss. this happens because you are dehydrated. weight loss may also happen if you are losing all of those sugar calories in your urine instead of using them. increased hunger. you feel hungry because your body is not using all the calories that it can. many of them are being excreted in urine. blurred vision. your vision may blur when sugar builds up in the lens of your eye. the sugar sucks extra water into your eye which changes the shape of the lens and blurs your vision. fatigue. you feel tired for the same reason you feel hungry. your body is not using the calories you are eating and your body is not getting the energy it needs. all of these symptoms will get better or go away when your blood sugar levels are controlled. if your blood sugar rose to very high levels at the time you were diagnosed with diabetes you may have received treatment in a hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis which is an emergency. what symptoms might i have now? now that you are taking insulin injections watch for signs of either high or low blood sugar. high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) usually develops slowly over a few days or weeks. but it can also develop quickly (in just a few hours) if you eat a large meal or miss an insulin dose. on the other hand low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) can develop within 10 to 15 minutes. children especially very young children are at greater risk for harm caused by very low blood sugar levels. watch for the following symptoms of high or low blood sugar. you (or your child) may not have the same symptoms every time and you may have symptoms that are not listed. symptoms of low blood sugar include sweating weakness and inability to concentrate. severe low blood sugar can cause loss of consciousness and seizures. symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst and increased urination. signs of high or low blood sugar in young children can be confusing but may include paleness and a sudden change in emotion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: while playing baseball i was struck just above the knot in my ankle. could there be a hairline fracture? . i'm now at six days with a goose egg on my lower leg and a contusion just under my ankle with discomfort/tightness.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're experiencing some sort of nerve issue. it's important to note that you're not alone in this situation. many people have a "lose" ankle joint (located below the ankle bone) that's not easily repaired. the best thing you can do is get it checked out by your primary care provider. he or she will be able to give you a diagnosis and treatment plan. if you're having any signs of a nerve issue you need to see a doctor. it may be a fracture or even a nerve problem. it is important to take care of yourself. if it's a nerve injury you should see a health care provider right away.

Question: how do i know if i qualify for a subsidy in the health insurance exchanges?
Answer: the affordable care act requires that people with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level qualify for subsidies. the affordable health care act also requires that the government provide health insurance coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. the law also requires insurers to offer plans to people who have incomes below 400% or more. if you have a pre-insurance policy you'll need to purchase a plan through the marketplace. if your income is less than 400% you'll qualify for an affordable care subsidy.
Expected Response: if you earn between 100-400% of the federal poverty level (fpl) you are eligible for a subsidy on the exchange. in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. if you are unsure if you qualify it is still simple to find out. the application for health insurance on your state’s health insurance exchange will calculate your eligibility for you. simply visit your state’s exchange website when enrollment begins on october 1 2013. if you are ineligible for subsidies on the exchange because you qualify for medicare or medicaid the health insurance exchange will enroll you into the appropriate program. in this sense it is designed to be a one-stop shop with “no wrong door. ”

Question: what foods should i avoice for meneire's disease? . my doctor told me to eat a "no salt chocolate wine cheese and caffeine diet (a migraine diet? ). can you provide me with an established diet that avoids triggers for meniere's?
Answer: no. you will not be able to achieve a "complete" migraine diet.
Expected Response: the mainstay of a diet for menieres is low sodium typically under 2000mg daily. that means focusing on whole foods that naturally have less sodium over processed foods with sodium added. these foods include fruits vegetables whole grains unprocessed meats and healthy fats. when choosing other items read the label. this list should help you figure out low sodium choices. it's also beneficial to limit caffeine in items like coffee tea and soda. these are other foods high in caffeine. i think the cheese and wine has to do with migraines and not menieres so you'll have to check with your doctor on that. i would focus on sodium first. good luck!

Question: how long does a rash last. had a rash all around my mouth for 6 weeks ( just like a go-tee) and nothing is helping hydroclorasone eucerine etc. now it's under one eye and eyelid. the doctor told me it was a rash . it doesn't really itch but it gets quite red and lightens up from time to time. another doc said infection bacteria or fungal. tried anti baceria and fungal cremes to no avail. heeeeeeeeelp!
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a bacterial infection. you may have been exposed to fungal infection (infection of the fungal skin) by a fungal strep (infected skin). you may also have been infected with fungal cysts (infections that cause fungal infections) by an infectious bacteria. you can try a variety of topical medications to help treat your symptoms.
Expected Response: it would be impossible to predict the outcome of a skin eruption since every person is different when it comes to healing times. additionally it appears that you have not been definitively diagnosed so seeing a dermatologist at this point would be prudent. a "rash" is a very very vague diagnosis. there are thousands of causes so after six weeks of treatment failure i think you need to see a specialist.

Question: what can you put on bites from fire ants?
Answer: bite marks are not caused by a bite but rather by a fungus called an ant. bite marks can be caused by: a fungus that can grow on skin. a fungus on the skin of a bite. a bite mark that looks like a bite marks. a person that has a bite that looks similar to a bite and has a small amount of blood in it. a small blood clot that can be seen in the bite mark. a bruise on the bite. an infection on the head of a person. a cold sore on the body. a rash on the face or in the mouth. a skin infection. a blood clot on the scalp. a sore throat. a bump on the upper lip of a child. a lump on the tongue. a wart on the lips. a fever. a swollen lymph node. a viral infection.
Expected Response: if you have been stung by a fire ant you should softly wash the skin with a mixture of soap and water; this will get rid of the venom on the surface. if you have rubbing alcohol around you also should disinfect the area of the bites. you can then put some ice in a washcloth and hold it next to the bites for about 15-20 minutes. that will help keep down swelling and make it a little less irritating the next day. fire ant stings are also accompanied by a lot of itching so you may want to use a hydrocortisone or diphenhydramine-based cream. be careful and don't scratch! this could lead to secondary skin infections a trip to the doctor and possibly antibiotic treatment.

Question: what does it mean when there is a red blotch on your scrotum? . hello i am a 16 year old male and just recently found a red blotch on my scrotum it isn't itchy and it is always moist i am not sure if the moisture is puss or sweat i think it might be some fungal infection or just jock rash but can someone tell me what i might have?
Answer: it is possible to have a bacterial infection but it is not a common thing.
Expected Response: most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal "red blotch". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated.

Answer: hi this is from the uk's nhs you should have seen your doctor or gyno and have your blood work done. the problem is that the vein that you are having is not as thick as it used to be. the vein is there for a reason and the blood is not going to get it to where it needs to be to be there. this is why the veins are there. you need to get a blood test done at home. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi it would be best if you go along to a uro and get it looked at but do tell how you come by it it would be best to tell how it really happened take along the clamp as well. good luck

Question: if my grandkids got chickenpox and i already had it can i go to work and not infect people i work in food service?
Answer: the chickenpox vaccine is not a good idea. you can get it from a pharmacy or a food service provider but you can't get it if you don't have a health insurance plan.
Expected Response: exposure to infectious diseases like chicken pox does not mean that you can spread it to others. you would actually need to have chicken pox yourself in order to do that. chicken pox re-exposure can cause you to get shingles but that would be a different question. your co-workers in food service will not be at risk.

Question: i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back. i have no idea what this means.
Answer: hi i think your find this is a common side effect of taking a shower. this is why you need to take a shower with your skin on it's back to normal. if you have a cold or flu it would be best to get this checked out by a doctor. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this and that it's concerning you. the skin is an amazing organ. one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin's surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm. this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing (a red appearance) and may make the skin feel hot. the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core. i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday? is it because you're exercising for example? are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes? or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day? our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you're getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit. i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally (your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat) but perhaps there's some underlying cause for this that should be checked out. i wish you all the best with this! i have a question for you. do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring? the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating. over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i don't. the heat is trapped inside. not being able to sweat is known as "anhidrosis" research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue. i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways. hope this helps. this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call "empty heat" or "empty fire" "the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general (irrespective of organ) are: - a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening - a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips - malar flush (red cheekbones) - a dry throat at night - a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called a5-palm heat@) - dry stools - scanty-dark urine - a floating-empty and rapid pulse - a red tongue without coating. " <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body. see the url above for more information. western medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms. i would recommend seeing a competent traditional chinese medical doctor in your area preferably one with the degree omd (orental medical doctor) a traditional chinese medical doctor not just a licensed acupuncturist. (the difference can be more that 5 years of study and clinical education) hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last 4 months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normal. i finally found the cure in an unlikely place. i have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad 4 months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctor(ayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda <link> so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathic(mainstream) medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda it's called ushna(heat) and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for 40 days but just today being the third day i am already feelin 60% better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddha(<link> doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isn't one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at <link> they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country. hope you'll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it. hello friends i had similar problem since almost 10 years. i am m/30 years now. my normal body temperature when i was not feeling feverish would be about 96. 8 f (almost 2 degree fahrenheit lesser than normal). when i am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about 97. ish rarely reaching 98. no doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesn't show up on thermometer. however strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not. i would feel feverish with chills. i would have episodes of feverish feeling every 2 months or so and every time it would last for a 2-3 weeks. doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful. i do not have thyroid or any other deficiency however i have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease as well. the reason i write this time is because something miraculous happened this and i would want others' opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well. this might very well be a cure: treatment: day1: take 500mg paracetamol. after 30 mins take vitamin c + zinc supplement day2: continue vitamin c+ zinc daily for next few days. i got fantastic relief on day 2 onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to 96. 9ish j waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery.

Question: a cat scan showed that i have a fatty liver. what can i do to change my lifestyle to resolve the situation? . i know that the right side under my right lower ribs has been painful (like pressure against the ribs) for the last year i am overweight (i'm 200 lbs at 5'6") and 62 years old female. i really want to lose weight learn to eat healthier and try to stop the fat from accumulating. is this possible and what kind of diet should i be following? i also have hypothyroidism and am on synthyroid. . thank you. carol
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're experiencing some type of liver disease. unfortunately i can't offer you any specific advice. there are many different causes of liver problems including: chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. people with certain liver problems may have a genetic predisposition to developing liver disease such as a genetic mutation or an inherited
Expected Response: a fatty liver is reversible. being overweight is one of the many causes for this condition. lose some weight and lose some liver fat. hypothyroidism should not interfere with your losing weight objective. in order to maintain a weight of 200 pounds you're consuming about 1844 calories per day. to reduce your weight by one (1) pound per week reduce your daily calories to about 1344. here is my abbreviated version of a plan that will enable you to eat better and lose some of the excess weight. : - begin by seeing your family doctor and obtain approval to start a reduced calorie diet. eliminating 500 calories from your daily diet can be challenging but will also prove to be rewarding and is achievable. - search the web for free 1300 daily printable diet plans. look for one that includes at least seven (7) days of planning covering three (3) meals per day and snacks. some of these diet plans may even include a printable shopping list and recipes to complete the main courses for each meal. look for diets that use a safe breakdown of calories (55% carbs -15% protein- 30% fats). - drink at least 64 oz. of water each day. - with your doctor's approval start a modest exercise program. a brisk walk will burn about 100 calories per mile while gardening will burn an additional 100 calories in 30 minutes. - take steps to learn dieting do's and do not's. do not skip meals but do learn how to substitute one food for another and how to order a meal at the restaurant while not sabotaging your diet. - keep a diary of foods and beverages consumed along with a record of your weight losses. - reward yourself for accomplishing diet goal objectives (have your nails manicured and painted get a new hair style or purchase a new handbag). - consider joining a dieting support group. you'll hear success stories make new friends and will learn additional tips to making dieting a positive self-improvement venture. best wishes for your success.

Question: do any medicare supplemental plans cover adult daycare for elders with cognitive limits due to dementia?
Answer: there are no medicare medicare plans that cover day care for adults with dementia.
Expected Response: no. medicare generally does not pay for services that people with dementia most commonly need -- help dressing bathing and eating among others. you likely need a long-term care policy to cover such costs and unfortunately once dementia has set in it's too late to purchase one. to find services in your community that can possibly help make contact with the alzheimer's association: www. alz. org.

Question: my son vomited about 10 minutes after taking a second dose of penicillin for strep throat. should he take the next dose?
Answer: i don't know what your son was taking. if he was taking the antibiotic he should have been given the next day. i would not take him to the emergency room unless he was medically-ill.
Expected Response: penicillin can be harsh on the stomach. it is important to take it with food and not on an empty stomach. your pharmacist may also be able to flavor the medication to make it easier for your son to take. i would make sure the vomiting has subsided before giving him another dose. since i don’t know the original diagnosis or the reason for his penicillin prescription i wouldn’t know if the condition is causing the vomiting or the medication. let his stomach settle a bit and try giving him something small to eat something that will be light on his stomach. see if he can hold this down before giving him another dose of medication. if the vomiting continues consult your health care provider to discuss an option that may be less upsetting to his stomach.

Question: what is fraxel and how does it compare to a co2 laser peel?
Answer: fraxels are very inexpensive and are very effective. it is a very easy procedure to perform. the best part is that you can use them in a very clean environment and the laser is very light-sensitive.
Expected Response: fraxel is a non-ablative erbium-glass treatment that has been used to improve acne scars and uneven pigmentation with some success. usually 4-6 treatments are needed. there is usually little down time with redness and scaling for a few days after the treatment. fractional co2 treatments build on the gold-standard co2 resurfacing laser for improvement of lines wrinkles sun damage and other signs of aging. usually only a treatment is needed but it is ablative which means that there is greater recovery time usually about 7-10 days.

Question: how does hand foot and mouth disease affect pregnancy and the baby?
Answer: yes. hand foot disease can cause a variety of symptoms including: fever severe cramping severe diarrhea and difficulty breathing.
Expected Response: commonly hfm is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. information regarding fetal exposure to hfm during pregnancy is limited. no solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects. however should a baby be born to a mother with active hfm symptoms the risk of neonatal infection is high. typically such newborns have a mild illness. rarely overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as liver heart and brain can be lethal.

Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for bacterial vaginosis?
Answer: there are many different types of vaginitis. some are bacterial vagins and some are viral vaginomas. some of these vaginotic vaginoses are called "bv-type" vaginomatoses. vaginotitis is a sexually-transmitted disease that is caused by a bacterium called bv-1. bv1 is a common sexually-active bacteria that is not contagious. it is not a sexually transmitted disease. bovine vaginoma is a bacterial vaginae infection that is a rare sexually-sensitive disease. it can be caused by any of the following: genital herpes. genital herpes is caused in men by a virus that causes genital herpes (genital herpes is also called genital herpes). herpes simplex (genitourinary herpes). genital herpes can be transmitted from person to person through sexual contact. oral herpes. oral oral herpes
Expected Response: your doctor may only test you for bacterial vaginosis if you: have symptoms. are going to have a hysterectomy or surgical abortion ( bacterial vaginosis increases infection risk afterwards). are pregnant and have had a preterm delivery in the past (a past preterm delivery may have been caused by infection). your doctor can diagnose bacterial vaginosis based on your history of symptoms a vaginal examination and a sample of the vaginal discharge. laboratory tests to detect signs of bacterial vaginosis may include: wet mount. a sample of vaginal discharge is mixed with a salt (normal saline) solution after placing it on a microscope slide. the prepared slide is examined to identify the bacteria present to look for white blood cells that indicate an infection and to look for unusual cells called clue cells. the presence of clue cells is the most reliable indicator of bacterial vaginosis. whiff test. several drops of a potassium hydroxide (koh) solution are added to a sample of vaginal discharge to determine whether a strong fishy odor is produced. a fishy odor on the whiff test suggests bacterial vaginosis. vaginal ph. the normal vaginal ph is 3. 8 to 4. 5. bacterial vaginosis usually causes the vaginal ph to rise above 4. 5. gram stain. a sample of the vaginal discharge is placed on a microscope slide. a special dye is applied to the slide causing certain types of bacteria (gram-positive bacteria) to turn a shade of purple while coloring others (gram-negative bacteria) pink. in bacterial vaginosis gram-negative bacteria especially gardnerella vaginalis are most common. oligonucleotide probes. this test detects the genetic material ( dna ) of bacterial vaginosis bacteria. oligonucleotide probe testing is very accurate but is not routinely available in most labs. the presence of clue cells an increased vaginal ph and a positive whiff test are enough evidence to treat for bacterial vaginosis. bacterial vaginosis may be detected during routine pap testing. but pap testing is not a standard test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: why do nipples get hard during exercise? . i'm not cold when i exercise in the gym but my nipples are always erect. what is the physiological response that's taking place?
Answer: hi yes nipples get very hard during your workout and this is why you need to get on some kind of bc pill this is the best way to go for your nipples. good luck
Expected Response: your nipples most likely become erect during exercise as part of the thermoregulation process of maintaining your body’s internal core temperature or as a result of other stimuli. there doesn’t seem to be a clear agreement for the physiological response that is taking place during exercise specifically but here are a few ideas: • your body heats up during exercise and it produces sweat as a response. your sweat evaporates from your skin removing heat and cooling your body in the process. your nipples can become erect as they are being cooled since coldness is a stimulus for erect nipples. • exercise shirts are designed to be “breathable” by increasing circulation to disperse heat away from your skin. this increased airflow and circulation could compound the cooling effect of evaporation. • your nipples are very sensitive so the continual friction caused by your shirt vigorously moving back and forth as you exercise may be irritating them. • your body may just be at a heightened state of arousal during exercise. this doesn’t mean sexual arousal rather just a physiological state of heighted autonomic arousal that you experience during exercise in the same way that you experience changes to heart rate respiratory rate perspiration etc. erect nipples may just be another natural component of that. try to take notice of when you first experience this happening so that maybe you can better identify what’s triggering it. if it bothers you i would suggest wearing a padded exercise bra if you’re a woman or experiment with different clothing materials for your shirt. try putting your exercise shirt as a base layer and a cotton t-shirt over it to help keep you warm and to cover it up. you can also buy nipple covers or put a band-aid over them to help conceal them.
================================================================================
Question: how do you get tendinitis?
Answer: tendinosis is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics. however it can be caused by many different bacteria.
Expected Response: tendonitis is usually caused by overuse of a muscle group or joint. repeated sliding of the tendon during heavy use especially when a person is unaccustomed to it can result in irritation causing pain in and around the tendon. “tennis elbow ” or lateral epicondylitis is an example of tendonitis resulting from overuse or strain. other sports activities (e. g. golf) and chores (house painting) can cause tendonitis too. for some people with tendonitis no repetitive activity can be blamed as a cause; wear-and-tear from aging probably plays a role in these cases of tendonitis. using proper swing mechanics in tennis and golf and trying not to overdo it when starting a new activity are the best ways to avoid tendonitis. should i get an xray to determine whether i have a tendinitis or fracture round my knee?

Question: what can i do about cesarean section or pregnany scars?
Answer: cesaresan is not covered by medicare.
Expected Response: scarring results from a either a tear in the dermis (stretch marks) or an overgrowth of collagen with raised scars (keloids ). there is really no way to prevent scars completely. if you are genetically predisposed to scar formation you probably will have a scar. once a keloid scar develops intervene early (before the scar is raised and thickened) and massage your scar frequently with a vitamin e based moisturizer; this helps break down additional collagen build-up. during pregnancy remain well-hydrated in order to keep the dermis healthy and less susceptible to tearing also moisturize with a vitamin e based moisturizer.

Question: can a urine test detect chlamydia if a tampon was worn while urinating? . does wearing a tampon or having your cycle affect the accuracy of the test?
Answer: hi ok if your not on bc its the pill its the bc pill its just a pill if you google bc you will find lots of info on its its all down there for you. good luck
Expected Response: a tampon will not affect the accuracy of a urine test. these are two different "compartments". a urine chlamydia test or any other urine test would still be accurate whether you had a tampon in or not.

Question: i have pierced ears and the holes are getting stretched out. can dermal fillers fix my ears so they are like new again? . does this hurt and who can do this? do i need to see a dermatologist or an ent doc?
Answer: the best thing you can do is get your ears properly examined by a dermatology professional. i'm sorry you're going through this. unfortunately it's impossible to blindly guess at the cause of your ears. there are many different causes of ear infections and ear infections can be caused by various things. unfortunately there is no cure for ear infections. however there are some medications that can help you with the pain and swelling. you can check out the following webmd articles to see what may be causing your ear pain: <link> ear pain and ear pain can be from a variety of causes. some of the most common causes are: ear infections: ear infection can be a sign of an ear infection. ear infections may be caused from an
Expected Response: dermatologist plastic surgeons and certain ent doctors who are aesthetically trained can inject dermal fillers into the earlobes to create more volume which will make the hole smaller; and this is a temporary fix for this problem. over time if that earlobe continues to stretch if that hole continues to stretch and pull the earlobe down with earrings then it can actually be removed and sown back together and then you can make a new hole to solve that problem on a permanent basis. however it also might help if you wear an earring that has a larger back that gives more support and try not to wear earrings that are too heavy that are going to pull down or if you do wear those once in a while try not to wear them for longer than you absolutely have to.

Question: is a blood pressure of 153/94 dangerous when i have always had a very normal blood pressure before? . i have had normal blood pressure for years but now i have excessively rapid resting pulse and bp in the 150/95 area. i have had a nuclear stress test that showed normal parameters. i am not sure if this is normal or not.
Answer: hi just google natural ways out of high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you will find lots of info. good luck
Expected Response: i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!

Question: what kind of doctor should i see for high blood pressure? . i need a physical and recently i've checked my blood pressure and it has been high. i want to know what kind of doctor should i see?
Answer: most helpful answer if you have high blood pressures (hypertension) and your doctor has prescribed a blood pressure medication for you that is appropriate for you then you should see a cardiologist. you can get a cardiology cardiologist by calling the cardiologist's office at 1-800-cardiologists (1-800) cardiologists. if you are not sure what type of cardiologist you are talking about you should consult a cardiologist.
Expected Response: the best plan is for you to see the primary care doctor. that person can complete your physical assess your blood pressure concerns possibly start treatment if necessary and refer you to other medical specialists as needed. while waiting to see your primary care doctor i would continue to periodically take ramdom b/p readings. start a journel to record those readings along with the date and time taken whose machine was used (your own or a local pharmacy etc. ) arm used for testing standing or sitting position and all recent activities that you were engaged in (eating exercise etc. ) prior to the testing. show the journal entries to your doctor during the office visit. if you used your own machine to obtain the readings it is advisable to also bring it to your medical appointment for confirm of its accuracy.

Expected Response: it sounds like you're doing a good job caring for your post-surgical wounds. be sure to keep following all the post-surgical instructions you were given. the risk of infection for your procedure is relatively low. the classic signs of infection are: fever loss of appetite feeling like you're coming down with the flu severe pain/swelling/bleeding in the surgical area. if the "gooey pus" you're seeing is yellowish in color chances are good this is not an infection. as the skin heals itself it tends to over-produce protein cells. these cells look kind of yellow gooey and sticky. if that's what you're seeing it's probably a normal part of the healing process. don't scrub these cells off. just gently wash with warm soapy water and rinse well. if your surgeon told you to use antibiotic ointment like bacitracin then continue to do so according to the post-surgical instructions you were given. as your wounds heal you also can apply a vitamin a & vitamin d ointment (often used for diaper rash) to help your skin heal. if you develop a fever or any other signs of a true infection contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Question: my daughter has cavities in her bottom molars. she needs a root canal and a silver cap. why is this done for baby teeth?
Answer: you should not have a root cavity in your baby teeth. there are no silver caps on your teeth. they are not used to fill cavities.

Question: i had a tubal ligation in aug. of this year and now i'm aroused all the time. why is that? . i'm not sure why i'm having this problem. i've been to the er twice and it's never been this bad. i'm wondering if it's because of the tubal or just because i'm getting aroused all over again. i have a tubiligation and i have no other symptoms.
Answer: hi its just a case of the hormones getting out of whack with your body. but it could be just a hormonal imbalance that is causing you to get a tubelike cycle. if you get a period and you get your period then its time to get your periods back. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: well that's an interesting question! i suggest you consult your gynecologist to make sure everything's doing fine medically speaking. some women find they feel more frisky after tubal ligation or hysterectomy because they know they can't become pregnant. for some women this knowledge makes them feel more relaxed and playful about sex. perhaps this is the case for you. i can't think of any medical reason why a tubal ligation would make you feel aroused all the time but if it's a problem then i certainly suggest you consult a medical professional. if it's not a problem i'd suggest going with the flow and enjoying yourself. take care!

Question: i have been having anxiety attacks trouble sleeping weepyness severe agitation lack of motivation to do anything. i am wondering which of these is the most urgent to get my dr to help me with. are these signs of depression or something else?
Answer: anxiety attacks are caused by stress. stress can be caused by: anxiety. stress is the stress of life. stress causes the body to become more stressed. stress also causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain. stress triggers the release of chemicals that cause depression. stress may also cause a decrease of blood flow in the brain which can lead to depression. anxiety is a condition that is caused by a lack of control over your life. it may be caused when you are stressed and you are not able to control your stress. it can also be caused from stress such as from being out of work or being unemployed. stressors can also cause anxiety. if you have anxiety attacks it may not be because you are depressed or have a history of depression
Expected Response: i suggest going to your doctor and describing exactly what you are going through. also if this is not the first time this has happened you need to mention that as well. when you are severely agitated do you feel like you are outside yourself looking in and wanting to stop yourself from doing or saying whatever is going on but it's like you have no control over what you are doing? make a list of all the things that you do or feel so you don't forget like if you have tons of energy out of the blue or go on major shopping sprees or if you feel like no one cares about you or your feelings. search deep within yourself even the things that you hate to think about much less talk about and write it all down and go to your doctor. he may have some options for you. i am no doctor but by what you described is what i used to feel like and then some. i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. i used to get panic attacks all the time but they went away. i'm not diagnosing you but suggesting that you see a doctor. you may just be going through something that happens when the seasons change ironically called seasonal affective disorder (sad. )

Question: why can't you give children baby aspirin?
Answer: no. there is no evidence that aspirin is safe for children. there are no studies that show that aspirin will harm a child.
Expected Response: basically there is no need for children to get aspirin now that acetaminophen and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter and approved for children. these are safer alternatives and it is best to just avoid giving aspirin to children entirely. aspirin has been linked to causing a rare but severe reaction called reye's syndrome in children who have certain viral illnesses. reye's syndrome can be fatal and causes damage to the liver and the brain.

Question: what are the health risks of ulcerative colitis?
Answer: the risk of ulcers is very low. in fact the risk is very high. it is estimated that about 1 in 5 people will have ulceratively colic disease in the next year. the number of people with ulceratives is also very high and the number is expected to rise. the incidence of ulcs is highest in people who are older than 60 and those with higher incomes. the risk increases with age. in the united states about 1. 3 million people die from ulceration each year. ulcers are caused by bacteria that live in the intestines. the bacteria cause inflammation and can cause inflammation of the lining of the mouth and mouth muscles. the lining is the outer layer of the stomach and is the most important source of food and fluid for the body. the immune system is the body's defense mechanism against infection. the body fights off infection by producing antibodies that fight off the bacteria. the antibodies
Expected Response: because ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine it can cause severe and sometimes bloody diarrhea putting patients at risk for iron deficiency and anemia. ulcerative colitis can also deplete stores of folate. that's especially dangerous for women of child-bearing age since folate deficiency is linked to birth defects. fluid loss from diarrhea can also cause electrolyte imbalances. severe infections can occur in the large intestine but they are uncommon. ulcerative colitis is also associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. for that reason doctors recommend frequent colonoscopy examinations. your doctor may discuss other risks with you.

Question: how much should i weigh?
Answer: weight is not the only factor that can affect a person's height. you can also have a number of other factors that can make it more difficult for you to gain weight. your height is also influenced by many different factors such as genetics genetics genetics and diet. your doctor can help you choose the right weight for you based on your height and genetics.
Expected Response: doctors nutritionists and public health authorities most often use the body mass index to define a healthy weight. body mass index (bmi) is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2). according to the cdc a bmi of less than 18. 5 is considered underweight. a normal bmi falls within the range of 18. 5 to 24. 9. the bmi range of 25. 0 to 29. 9 is considered overweight and a bmi of 30. 0 or higher is considered obese. . obesity increases the risk for diabetes high blood pressure heart attack stroke certain cancers. losing weight reduces your risk. waist size matters too. even in people who are only slightly overweight a waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women increases health risks. don’t believe your pant size; it often underestimates waist circumference. measure your waist yourself with a tape measure just below the belly button.

Answer: you have no choice but to buy a plan through your state's marketplace. you can buy a health plan through the marketplace through your local health insurance exchange. you'll need to check with your state to see if it's the best plan for you.

Question: what are the post-op instructions after an embryo transfer?
Answer: the post implant instructions are very specific. if you have a pre-eclampsia implant you will need to follow the instructions on the implant. if your implant is still in place you will want to check with your doctor before you begin the procedure.
Expected Response: there is no clear evidence that activitiy restrictions after an embryo transfer increase pregnancy rates. . most of the reproductive endocrinologists that i work with do advise light activity for a few up to 14 hours but not strict bed rest. personally i do advise patients to avoid sexual intercourse for up to a week because the prostaglandins in semen can cause strong uterine contractions. again i believe that this is empiric as i don't know of good evidence that demonstrates that intercourse lower the chances of conception. unfortunately we don't have evidence to support everything that we do. .

Question: my 3 year old son has ringworm and it’s spreading. what do i put on it? how long does it take to go away?
Answer: ringworm is a viral infection. it”s not contagious. but it can spread to other parts of the body. if you have ringworm you may have a small infection called a ringworm. if your child has ringworms you should see your health care provider for a proper examination and treatment.
Expected Response: i would be sure to see his pediatrician and/or pediatric dermatologist. they will most likely do a culture to identify if it is truly ringworm (which is a fungal infection of the skin that appears in worm-like round patches) or if it might be simple eczema or dry skin. using hydrocortisone on a fungal infection without properly addressing the infection could cause the rash to worsen. depending on how much of the body is affected the physician might recommend topical and or oral antifungal medications to get the rash under control.

Answer: weight-lifting exercises are a great way to get your body moving. they also help you lose weight and strengthen your bones. some of the best weight-training exercises for people with osteoporsosis include: push-ups. push-up exercises are great for people who have low-back pain and stiffness. push ups are great if you have a strong back or if you are in a wheelchair. you can also do push-downs with a chair or a chair-lift. pushups are also great for those who have arthritis. push up exercises are also good for people suffering from certain types of arthritis. for example if you're having pain in your lower back you can do push ups with a wheelchair or chair. if you can't do pushups with a leg lift you can use a chair lift. you may also do a push-down exercise with a bike. you could also do an
Expected Response: if your doctor determines that it's not safe for you to perform high-impact weight-bearing exercises he or she may recommend low-impact weight-bearing exercises that are less likely to cause fractures and also build and maintain bone density. these include: elliptical training machines low-impact aerobics stair-step machines walking (either outside or on a treadmill machine). if you're new to exercise or haven't exercised for awhile you should aim to gradually increase your level of weight-bearing exercise to 30 minutes per day on most days of the week. although exercise can benefit almost everyone with osteoporosis it's important to remember that it's only one component of an overall treatment program. other essential lifestyle recommendations include a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption. you also may require osteoporosis medications to either build or maintain bone density. by working with your doctor you can develop an osteoporosis treatment program that's right for you.

Answer: i have no way of seeing your urinalysis results on your own but i can tell you that you are not alone. there are many different types of urinary tract infections (uti) and many different causes. some of the more common causes include: urinary tract infection (uti). this is a urinary tract disease that can cause pain and inflammation of the urethra. this is usually caused by a bacteria called perforantus. perforants are tiny tiny sacs that are attached to the walls of the bladder. they are called peritoneal infections.

Question: i have medical issues and my husband is healthy. . would it be more advantageous for us to have individual health insurance plans and deductibles?
Answer: i would not recommend that you purchase a health plan through your state's marketplace. you can shop for a plan through the marketplace and compare plans offered by other health plans offered in your area.
Expected Response: you and your husband can purchase separate policies if you prefer. your eligibility for a tax subsidy to help you purchase your policy if you qualify would be based on your household income. so if you are purchasing two policies you would each be able to use half of the credit. whether you should purchase an individual or a family policy based on you and your husband's health circumstances will depend on the policies available to you. you should look at whether the deductible applies to each of you individually or whether there is a family deductible. in the case of the family deductible your husband's health expenses may satisfy the deductible for both of you and it could be advantageous to purchase a family policy vs. two individual policies.

Question: if your doctor refuses to test you for something you think you have should you switch doctors? . i've been reading about my symptoms on the internet and i'm pretty sure i may have adult sids but my doctor refuses to run tests for it. how can i make him run the tests without making him mad? i want to do it tactfully. i feel like he's not listening. he just looks at me like i'm crazy when i express my concerns. should i switch doctors?
Answer: it sounds like you have a very specific medical condition called "sudden onset of symptoms " which means that your symptoms are becoming worse over time. the doctor may refuse to run a test for it because it is not medically necessary. if you are unsure if you have sids or not you can ask your doctor. if he refuses to do a test he may be able to do an evaluation.
Expected Response: you should always have the final say with what goes on with your health and your body. if you believe you have a health condition you did a good thing to express your concerns with your doctor. unfortunately your doctor doesn’t seem to be legitimizing or validating your concerns. your doctor may have good reason however to not support your claims. think back to the explanation that your doctor provided for you – is there any possibility that he or she could be right? research online is great but medical advice from a doctor is of course very credible as well. your doctor may have limited exposure to the condition though so maybe you could find a specialist in the area. it’s important to consider the source of your information. another point to consider is that maybe you didn’t express yourself well enough. print out some of the research that you’ve found and try talking to your doctor about what could be causing some of the specific symptoms. in general it’s also important to consider the test itself too. how accurate and reliable is it? is it invasive or are there risks to having it done? what are the pros and cons of doing the testing? there’s no harm in getting a second opinion. just as different people may have different political views; doctors may have differing medical views as well. maybe you can find a different doctor that will better support your views or help you to understand why testing may not be in your best interest. you always have the right to change doctors especially if you have one who will not listen to your concerns. maybe he is not familiar with this condition called sads. <link>

Question: what are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?
Answer: symptoms of the disease may include: swollen lymph nodes in the groin and abdomen. fever. diarrhea. fatigue. muscle aches. nausea. vomiting. diarrhea can also be caused by the presence of an ulcer or other digestive tract infection. symptoms may include a sudden change in the way your stomach feels. a change in your appetite. nausea may also be due to the presence or absence of a stomach virus. a sudden increase in your blood pressure. a loss of appetite. a decrease in appetite. fever may also occur if you have a fever of 100 or higher. a rash. a fever may be caused when the body's immune system attacks a foreign body such as a bacteria. swelling of the face or face area. swelling in the mouth or throat. swelling or swelling of your lips. a redness or swelling on your tongue. a sore throat. a cough.
Expected Response: common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding and diarrhea but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. generally patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. the different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation: ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. in many patients with ulcerative proctitis mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may in addition experience rectal pain urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling) and tenesmus (ineffective painful urge to move one's bowels). proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). symptoms of proctosigmoiditis like that of proctitis include rectal bleeding urgency and tenesmus. some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and the descending colon). symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal cramps weight loss and left-sided abdominal pain. pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon left colon transverse colon and the rectum). symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal pain and cramps weight loss fatigue fever and night sweats. some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. generally however patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration severe abdominal pain protracted diarrhea with bleeding and even shock. they are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colon rupture (perforation). patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. unless they respond to treatment promptly surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colon rupture. while the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. therefore when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his disease the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. nevertheless a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. thus patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis.

Question: how should i take requip for parkinson's disease?
Answer: requip is a medication that is used to treat parkinsonism. it is used in combination with other medications to treat the symptoms of parkinson syndrome. requip may be taken with other medicines to treat symptoms of other conditions such as parkinson disease. it should be taken as directed by your doctor. if you have questions about taking requip ask your doctor or pharmacist. if requip does not work for you ask your health care provider.
Expected Response: be sure to take your requip exactly as directed by your doctor or healthcare provider. three times a day is the usual way to take requip for parkinson's disease. your doctor will start you on a low dose of requip. your doctor will change the dose until you are taking the right amount of medicine to control your symptoms. it may take several weeks before you reach a dose that controls your symptoms. if you miss a dose do not double your next dose. contact your doctor if you stop taking requip for any reason. do not restart without consulting your doctor. your doctor may prescribe requip alone or add requip to medicine that you are already taking for parkinson's disease. you can take requip with or without food. taking requip with food may decrease the chances of feeling nauseated.

Expected Response: i can hear the frustration in your question. it's always annoying when we do what we're told and our medical problem still doesn't clear up. unfortunately only your doctor can tell you what's going on. i can tell you that some infections require more than one course of antibiotics to treat. or they require a very specific antibiotic. because your physician knows your medical history he or she can look into this further to determine what the best course of action is. i'm sorry you're going through this. all of us in medicine sometimes wish we had a magic wand in order to cure people's conditions immediately. as of right now we're still waiting. hang in there!

Question: how can i help my 50 yr old fiancee' through issues in her menstrual cycle? . prior to menstruation she not only is irritable but easily angered and flies into rages she becomes despondent and paranoid starts to drink heavily often becoming drunk. when her flow arrives it is extremely heavy clots and heavy pad soaking in 2 hours or less. she becomes weak and tired. she has been prescribed 20 mg evanapril once daily for during menstruation but does not take it. she is a little overweight but active and in good health non smoker. what should i do to assist her?
Answer: hi if you google this you will find lots of info on this you should find lots lots of help for her to cope with. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: good for you for trying to help your partner! i can only imagine how this takes a toll on you. i agree that she should see her doctor again and get a few blood tests done. if she is losing that much blood she may be anemic causing her to feel weak and tired. try to get her to a gyno and go with her if possible. i personally would be most worried about the drinking and paranoia. alcohol is a depressant and is more than likely making things worse though she may feel a bit better at the time she is drinking. there could also be some underlying depression. until she gets to the doctor do your best to be patient and kind. she is clearly not herself at this time and probably feels bad about how she treats you afterwords. try distracting her and getting her to do a bit of excersice (a walk around the park) as it can help some period symptoms. worse comes to worse offer chocolate!

Answer: hi if you google osteoponosis you will find lots of info on it you will see lots of different ways of getting rid of it. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: most treatments for osteoporosis -- like bisphosphonates and serms -- work by slowing down the process of bone loss. since your body is always naturally remodeling bone slowing down the rate of bone loss may allow it to make new bone faster than you lose it. however forteo is the first treatment that directly spurs the growth of bone. it's usually given as an injection once a day in the thigh or abdomen. prolia works to stop bone loss by directing inhibiting cells that remove bone before they cause bone loss.

Expected Response: you can do lunges and stair climbing for your legs. no external resistance just your own body weight. if you have someone to hold you by the legs you can do back extensions by lying on your belly with your torso off the bed and lift your back up. you can also just do this lying on the floor then you won't need anyone to hold you. for lats you can lie down on the floor bring your arms up in front of you elbows on the floor and press down trying to lift your torso off the floor. that will work lats. you can also do chair dips they will work your lats a little. it can be more difficult to exercise while traveling but it’s certainly still attainable. here are some ideas and suggestions for ways that you can get exercise while traveling: • there are plenty of different body weight exercises calisthenics or stretches that you can do in your hotel room. here’s a great list of exercises that don’t require equipment: <link> • many hotels have onsite fitness rooms or swimming pools that you may have access to • try to find nearby parks or ways to get involved in recreational activities outdoors • go for a walk or run outside or do stair climbing • resistance bands require little space so they can be packed easily and be used in a hotel room • if you’re bringing a laptop you can bring an exercise dvd to use in your hotel room. if you don’t own an exercise video you can search for free ones to watch online be unconventional and think outside of the box if necessary. if it’s still a challenge for you to do exercise while traveling make it a point to be more diligent by doing exercise on days where you have more control of your environment or try to plan your exercise around travel as best as possible.

Question: i have an abscess tooth been treating w/anitbiotics. cant be pulled for another year due to insurance. will it be ok? . the tooth has been abscess for about 6 months now. i have another year to wait until my insurance will pay for the partial i need. i'm a woman and it's a front tooth and i don't want to go toothless for over a year. i don't want to hurt myself either so i need to know if i keep treating with antibiotics when it abscesses will i be ok until i can get my partial?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. you're a bit of a risk. it sounds like you've been diagnosed with an absorption problem. you need to see a dentist to get a diagnosis. if you're concerned about your condition you should see your primary care provider to get an opinion. you may need to have a dental hygienist perform a dental exam
Expected Response: that is a question that only your dentist can answer. waiting a year being toothless is not something that anyone would want to do. i really have no idea if you can wait a year. some medical and dental problems precede our insurance. you couldn't wait a year with appendicitis so you may not be able to wait a year before you have the proper insurance.
================================================================================
Question: how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?
Answer: you can manage dizzyness by using a variety of medications. some are more effective than others. for example: a combination of acetaminophen (tylenol) and ibuprofen (fen-lafridine) can help reduce dizziness. a combination with a combination or combination of naproxen (sertraline) and naproxyn (motrin) can increase dizziness and may help relieve dizziness symptoms. some medications may be more effective in treating nausea and vomiting.
Expected Response: dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.

Question: are there any types of blood pressure devices that are inserted inside of you invented? . any types of blood pressure checking devices that are inserted inside of you to check blood pressure? and by inserted inside i mean inserted permanetly inside of you. . thanks <positive_smiley>
Answer: i don't know the type of blood test you are using but i do know that there are a number of different types of testing. if you have a blood pressure test you can get it done by a cardiologist. you can also get it from a doctor who specializes in blood pressure.
Expected Response: to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it.
================================================================================
Question: what factors contribute to a successful nose job?
Answer: the most common cause of nose job loss is a combination of a lack of oxygen and a lack in oxygen-rich air. the common cause is a lack or lack of good air in the nose. a nose job that is not oxygen-poor can result in a nose infection. the most important factors that can cause a nose-job loss include: a lack a lack (or lack of) good air (or poor air) in the airway. a lack is a condition in which the airways are not properly filled. a cough or cold. a dry cough. a cold cough. the air in your nose is filled with mucous which is filled by your nose. the mucous in your nasal passages is filled in by your nasal passage. the nasal passages are filled with air that is filled from the air that you breathe in. the lining of your nose (the mucous lining) is filled and filled with a mucous
Expected Response: at consultation the evaluation includes a lot of factors some patients aren’t aware of. it’s not just the shape or size of your nose. it’s the quality the material there that is available to work with. for example thick oily skin tends not to drape down even though you shave down the bump and narrow the tip because what you are doing is narrowing the under the surface structures the bone and the cartilage. but the upholstery meaning the skin it does best when it’s thin and will shrink down uniformly and give a nice contour. so thick skin is a bit of a challenge for us. and oily skin has a greater tendency to have breakouts and all those things that kind of be a bit of a hassle for the patient. and the other question is even the strength of the cartilage because strong cartilages are really ideal because you can work with them easier. people that have very soft cartilage there’s a very narrow window in which you can work because if you’re a little over zealous and take out too much that cartilage is so weak that often the nose will kind of start to collapse and dip down. you’ve got to factor all these things into your decision making but that decision making is done really at the time of consultation. that’s where our most intense thoughts are being hatched because we have the patient in front of us we have the ability to feel to look size up the situation. we need to look inside the nose and see if there’s blockage because often if you make the nose a little narrower and the airway isn’t so super to begin with the patient may note afterwards that gee my breathing isn’t quite as good as it was before what’s going on here? so that patient may need to have the discussion about gee i think we need to open up your air passages a little bit while we’re there because after all the nose is still a functional organ regardless of how good it looks if it doesn’t work the patient is not going to be happy.

Question: my daughter is having pvcs and palpatations. . she is an 18 year old female in college who is 5 ' 1 and weighs 97 pounds. what can cause this sudden onset? she had a stress test yesterday and her resting heart rate was 111 and higher. she has been taking her medicine and is on a low dose of lisinopril. she is taking a home pregnancy test today and she is also having pvt. she had her pvt yesterday and was told she was pregnant.

Answer: you need to see a doctor for an examination and possibly a physical exam. i would not recommend doing a physical exercise program without a physical examination. it is not wise to exercise on a regular basis.
Expected Response: no way! it is not worth the risk of giving yourself a bigger pain with that ankle. what i now know is that when an ankle bruised. all those muscles that were able to help you not get hurt before are strained and stretched and if it heals proberly then you might be able to continue same lifestyle. after it has mended. if you make one simple bad move that might not seem difficult. it could. that is when you potentially always have a bad ankle. really just sit this one out.

Question: what causes a low white blood cell count?
Answer: the white blood cells in the blood are not normal for normal people. they are normal for people with diabetes. in fact the white cells are normal. they do not cause problems for people who do not have diabetes.
Expected Response: white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. as they mature white blood cells are continually released into the bloodstream. white blood cells circulate throughout the body ready to fight infections. they live about two or three weeks when they are broken down and recycled by the body. a normal white blood cell count is between about 4 500 and 10 000 cells per microliter. many conditions can cause a low white blood cell count: • infection (which usually increases the white blood cell count but may decrease it). • drugs especially chemotherapy. • human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). • severe alcohol abuse. • radiation therapy. • cancer affecting the bone marrow. • connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). many african-americans have a naturally lower white blood cell count. this is caused by a gene mutation that may have evolved as a defense against malaria. most often a low white blood cell count is temporary and improves on its own.

Question: what causes parkinson's disease?
Answer: parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder that can be caused by many things but it is not caused by any one disorder. it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. genetic factors can cause parkinsonism in many different ways. environmental factors are not the same as genetic factors. environmental changes in the environment can cause a person to develop parkinsonic disorder. for example certain foods can increase the risk of developing parkinson disease. certain foods may increase the likelihood of developing a condition called parkinson syndrome. for more information on foods that can increase your risk for parkinsons disease see this webmd article.
Expected Response: bodily movements are regulated by a portion of the brain called the basal ganglia whose cells require a proper balance of two substances called dopamine and acetylcholine both involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. in parkinson's cells that produce dopamine begin to degenerate throwing off the balance of these two neurotransmitters. researchers believe that genetics sometimes plays a role in the cellular breakdown. in rare instances parkinson's disease may be caused by a viral infection or by exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides carbon monoxide or the metal manganese. but in the great majority of parkinson's cases the cause is unknown.

Question: daughter tested positive for mono. the only symptom is swollen lymph nodes in her neck. can she play soccer? . she has no fever no swollen spleen no sore throat no fatigue. dr left it up to us whether or not she should play! just want to hear other opinions.
Answer: hi if you have mono then yes you should get tested for it then yes it is a good thing to get tested. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision.

Answer: osteoporsis is the most common cause of osteoporososis in women. it is caused by the body's inability to produce enough bone to support the bones in the spine. the body can't produce enough of bone to make bones work properly. it can't make bones that are strong enough to support a person's weight. osteopososis is a condition in which the bones of the bones that support the spine are weaker than those of the surrounding bone. the bones are weakened by the weight of the body. osteoborosis can affect your ability to walk and move. osteoarthritis is a disease in which bone loss occurs as a result of a change in the way your bones work. osteoblastic anemia is a disorder in which bones are lost due to injury. osteoclasts are a group of bone that are made of bone. osteoclastomas are a type of bone in which a change
Expected Response: talk to your health care provider about your chances for getting osteoporosis. many things put people at risk for osteoporosis. the following people have a higher chance of getting osteoporosis: women who: are going through or who are past menopause (“the change”). are white (caucasian) or asian. people who: are thin. have a family member with osteoporosis. do not get enough calcium or vitamin d. do not exercise. smoke. drink alcohol often. take bone-thinning medicines (such as prednisone) for a long time.

Question: where do i start if i have never exercised?
Answer: exercise is the most important part of a healthy lifestyle. you may want to consider a variety of exercise programs to help you lose weight. you can find information on exercise programs on the internet.
Expected Response: if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park further away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. if you prefer a more ambitious routine you can join a gym or try working out at home. try for 30 to 60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity (such as swimming biking walking dancing or jogging) at least three to five times a week. weight training can also help tone your muscles and elevate your resting metabolism rate. (the rate that the body burns fuel for energy) whatever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals.

Question: after tooth extraction do you have to replace with an implant?
Answer: the implant is the only way to remove the implant.
Expected Response: teeth need to be replaced for several reasons. to prevent surrounding teeth from tipping to prevent opposing teeth from extruding for protecting the integrity of your occlusion or bite. it also helps to keep the missing tooth as a one-tooth-problem. if you feel that you do not want an implant there are other options such as bridges and removable dentures. there is also the aesthetic reason if the missing tooth is visible. and you also want to preserve the chewing efficiency of your mouth.
================================================================================
Question: i take hydrocodone 10/660 for pain. is the 10 mg the pain medicine or acetaminophen dosage?
Answer: i would say it is the acetaminopropyl 10 mg. it is a pain reliever and it is very effective. it works in the same way as acetaminopa. you take it with a cup of tea or a cupful of milk. you can take it for pain if you have a migraine or if you are having a fever. it does not have any side effects.
Expected Response: the medication that you are on is a combination product that uses two medications to combat pain on two different levels. acetaminophen (660 mg) is an effective pain reliever and is used in combination with the hydrocodone (10 mg). you want to take the medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor or health-care provider.

Question: when is it safe to do heavy lifting and play contact sports after being infected with mono? . i was infected with mono about 4 weeks ago. i am training to enter a police force and need to do vigorous workouts and my doctor hasn't been very revealing about when i can safely go back to working out.
Answer: hi if you get mono from playing contact sports then you could be doing it for a while then it could be the virus but you need to get tested for it. good luck
Expected Response: only your doctor can give you that patient-specific "okay" or you will need to be cleared by another doctor. working out may not be an issue four weeks after mono but if your liver and/or spleen is still enlarged (not all people have this mono-related response) you should avoid contact or collision activities that could injury them. it takes an exam and perhaps an ebv titer (blood test) to know your state of recovery. some people improve rapidly and others do not.

Question: causes of nausea tightness around mid-section shortness of breath sweating trembling and pain (not heart or anxiety). heart had been checked 1 year ago with all tests possible and everything perfect. electrocardiogram at emergency room showed no change. have gastroparesis and esophageal spasms but have not had an attack like this before. gall bladder removed 1 1/2 years ago. had slightly elevated white count (had sinus infection) and sligtly low potassium level. woke up in the night with nausea and went downhill from there. a lot of pain and trouble breathing with sweating and trembling hands. have been to er and they said it's nothing serious.
Answer: hi if you google your problem with your heart then google your problems with your gall bladder and its your problem. good luck
Expected Response: i am not able to tell what might be going on particularly since you've had quite a few tests in the past. your condition is too complicated to figure out without the benefit of examining you. you need a doctor to examine you and i would be concerned particularly about the shortness of breath and pain/tightness. that is not something you should ignore. i assume when you had your heart checked it was because of these same types of symptoms. however they should still not be ignored and you should give your doctor a call.
================================================================================
Question: after having my appendix removed how long should it be until i have the staples from the surgery removed. (on the intestine/inside)
Answer: the surgery is not necessary for you to have an appendix removed. the appendix is a very small part of the body that can be removed surgically. it is not a "last resort".
Expected Response: your surgeon's office should have given you instructions on this. usually though staples come out between 10-21 days after surgery. note this is not a "do-it-yourself" deal. your doctor has a special tool to remove the staples without pain or pulling the wound open. in the meantime keep the incision clean. if your doctor told you to apply antibiotic ointment to the incision do so at least once a day. if your doctor did not tell you to apply any ointment to the incision then just leave it dry. never take a hand-held shower wand and use it to "blast" water on the incision at close range. this is a surefire way to force bacteria into the wound. just allow the shower water to run down over the incision and then pat it dry. remember to take it easy when it comes to lifting. your incision is rather fragile for awhile. in fact it takes about six weeks for scar tissue to equal the strength of sutures (below the skin). so be sure to follow all of your post-op instructions and activity restrictions carefully. wishing you well!

Question: i have not had an erection since my prostate gland was removed five years ago. what can be done to correct this problem? . test results have shown that i have a blood vessel that will not hold the pressure to maintain an erection. my doctor has ordered me to have an ultrasound. is this normal?
Answer: hi i think it would be best you see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: if you do have a blood flow issue then you should get great results from penile injection therapy (it does not hurt) or a vacuum erection device. if those do not work for you then you can still have a penile implant placed with great results and very happy patients and their spouses. i assume you are seeing a urologist who can discuss these and other options with you. if not you should. if these options were not discussed you may want to seek out urologists who have specialized their practice in ed.

Question: i am a15 year old boy. height=160cm weight=34 kg. please suggest a diet or exercise to gain weight. is yoga suitable? . how to overcome the situation of being underweight. is exercise (weight lifting) useful for gaining weight as per my condition. is running any good? what kind of food should i consume. what kind and exercise should i do? what exercise should be avoided?
Answer: you need to see a doctor for a physical exam. the best way to get the best results is to get a physical examination.
Expected Response: hi you really do need to look at your body make up before you go adding weight if you do have a very small frame then your weight could be right for it. did a check and its says your underweight but see there is always a but this can not be relied on you should really see your own doctor and go from there before you go packing on the ponds. but weight lifting is very good for you as is body building for you at 15 this may be a good way to go but keep off protein drinks or foods for now just stick to drinking extra milk and on training days do drink an extra one after your workout eat a couple of bananas a day but add some weight slowly slowly. but you should really see your doctor and see just how much weight he says you do need to gain and work with him checking your gains. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is rheumatoid arthritis and how is it different from "old age" arthritis?
Answer: rheumatic arthritis is a chronic disease caused by inflammation of the joints. it is caused by the same inflammation that causes arthritis in the joints of the body. it usually affects people over age 60.
Expected Response: rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn on itself attacking tissue that normally helps protect and preserve joint function. during an ra "attack" -- known as a flare -- the immune system sends out a barrage of white blood cells to the affected joint which in turn causes inflammation in the area. it is this inflammation that is responsible for the symptoms of ra including joint swelling and pain. osteoarthritis also known as "old age arthritis" or "wear and tear arthritis" is a natural degeneration of the cartilage between joints that occurs with aging. the degeneration can be worsened by overuse or injury but its impact is limited to the affected joints.

Question: i broke out in a rash only on my face. what could it be? . i did not change any products that i use on my face. same make-up face wash and lotion. i do have dry sensitive skin. i also have acne with regular breakouts but nothing like this rash before. its not that bright little bumps all over and itchy. i am 23 and have been trying to get rid of it for a year now.
Answer: hi if you have a rash on your face it could be your sunburn or something else. but do try to get it under control. good luck
Expected Response: unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to diagnosis a rash without actually seeing it first-hand. a description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call and without a diagnosis treatment suggestions would also not be possible. you will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist so that you can be be properly diagnosed and treated. are you just interested on creams and drugs which are useful to cure your skin problem or else any other source which can cure it. it is necessary to consult a dermatologist to judge on what type of rash you are suffering from and have to treat it. but before that why can't you just try products which can cure your skin problem naturally. usage of products with natural ingredients can help you to recover from many type of skin problems. best you can have from online search are products made out of argan nuts which might give positive results than other. you may try applying home remedies like paste from papayas or avocados. these home remedies may take longer time to work but are definitely safer for your sensitive skin. you may also look for hypoallergenic products that will not cause irritation to your skin. www. clearclinic. com - <link>

Question: what are at-home remedies for hives?
Answer: many people are unaware that there are no home remedies for at-risk hives. you can find out more about hives by visiting the webmd website.
Expected Response: one of the best remedies for hives is a soothing bath. add five or six tablespoons of oatmeal and three tablespoons of cornstarch or sodium bicarbonate to your bath water. if you are allergic to specific things such as bee stings or other insect bites certain foods or medications ask your doctor about prescribing an emergency kit containing epinephrine (also called adrenaline) which is an injection used to treat the severe or acute hives of anaphylaxis.

Question: for how many months is the acceptable serum creatinine result? . an individual has to undergo a radiology procedure where contrast media has to be injected how many months is the serum creatinine result can still be used as a reference? i just wanted to know if a serum creatinine result which is 4 months ago is still acceptable as a reference for kidney function for a presumingly normal individual. how about for an individual who has a other illness like diabetes chf that might be having kidney injury? up to how many weeks the sr. crea should be evaluated?
Answer: it is important to ask your doctor about the creatininine level for a kidney function test. most of the time the creatine is the result of a blood test. the creatination is the amount of blood that is produced when the kidneys are functioning normally. this is the number that is used to measure the amount and type of blood. the normal creatinines are about one to two millig
Expected Response: 24 hours is going to be ready the result

Question: what’s the best diet for great glutes?
Answer: there are two main types of glutes: the medial glutes and the lateral glutes. the medial and lateral glute are the two major muscles that support the upper body. the lateral and lateral muscles are the muscles that connect the lower back to the spine. the glutes are located on the lower side of the body and the medial muscles are located in the middle of the back. the most important muscle for maintaining balance is the gluteus maximus. the maxillary muscles are also located on both sides of the pelvis. the lumbar spine is located on either side of your pelvis and the lower spine is the most common muscle for stability. the main muscles for balance are the lats and the lutes.
Expected Response: quality: stick to whole foods. abandon processed and refined products because they’re not real food just “food-like” products. i like to call them science fair projects. most are laced with refined sugars that play havoc with your insulin levels resulting in a never-ending appetite for more junk. keep it simple. veggies fruits lean proteins and whole grains. eat smart fats that are healthy and satisfying like avocados and nuts. don’t forget to combine protein and fiber like a high protein greek yogurt with walnuts and blueberries. quantity: even if you’re eating whole foods you still have to rein in the calories and control your portions. steamed raw and grilled veggies especially the watery ones you can feast on. watery not densely sugared fruits are best (apples oranges berries melons). be careful with the whole grains especially bread products rice and pasta. make sure you read the labels and stick with one serving when you eat. you’ll need 4-6 oz of lean protein at any one sitting. frequency: eat a balanced meal or snack every 3-4 hours. if you do you’ll feel satisfied enough to eat less throughout the day resulting in more rapid and effective weight removal. make sure to cut off eating after dinner (which should be ideally no later than 8pm). or if you’re up and moving around after dinner and are truly hungry a 100-150 calorie healthy snack is acceptable like a yogurt or cottage cheese or an ounce of cheese.

Question: the day after my period ended i had sex with my bf he inserted his penis for a minute before putting condom on. . can i get pregnant even though it was right after my period? i've been nauseous and getting some cramps for about a week now. i'm not sure if i can get pregnant.
Answer: hi ok ok ok good luck
Expected Response: yes it is always possible. before a man orgasms he can release "pre-ejaculate" which is sperm and can get you pregnant. if you're on another method of birth control such as the pill iud depo provera nuva ring etc your chances are decreased. best way to tell is to either get a home pregnancy urine test or ask your doc for a lab slip for beta hcg blood testing.

Question: at what age or point is the t-score in bone density scans used instead of a z-score?
Answer: t-tests are used to diagnose and treat osteoporosis. they are used for patients with a variety of conditions and they are not used to determine the age or location of the t test.
Expected Response: a z-score compares your bone density to what is normal for someone your age. while a z-score alone is not used to diagnose osteoporosis in premenopausal women it can provide important information. here are some tips to help you understand your z-score: *if your z-score is above -2. 0 your bone density is considered within the ranges expected for your age or normal according to the international society for clinical densitometry (iscd). for example a z-score of 0. 5 -0. 5 and -1. 5 is considered normal for most premenopausal women. *if your z-score is -2. 0 or lower your bone density is considered below the expected range. examples are -2. 1 -2. 3 and -2. 5. if your z-score is in this range your health-care provider will consider your health history and possible causes of bone loss including secondary osteoporosis before making a diagnosis of osteoporosis. *if your z-score is normal but you've broken one or more bones from a minor injury your health-care provider may diagnose you with osteoporosis because some people with normal bone density break bones easily. as mentioned above a bone density test will also show a t-score. a t-score compares bone density to what is normal in a healthy 30-year-old adult.

Expected Response: i had the same thing happen to me while pregnant. my daughter is 1 now and perfectly healthy. you have to remember your body is sensitive now since you are pregnant. sex will make you bleed some times. you may even cramp. as long as it is light spotting or just a little blood you will be fine. when to worry would be heavy bleeding no movement and pain so bad you cant stand upright. i promise you will be ok <positive_smiley>

Question: what are the treatment options for low estrogen levels in a young woman? . i have had depression for the past 10 months and always felt that it was hormonal. about a month ago i got diagnosed with an ovarian cyst and it got me thinking that i should get my hormone levels tested to see if that was the cause of my depression. i got a saliva hormone test done and the results showed that i had menopausal levels of estrogen (i'm only 21! ). are saliva hormone tests acurate? what are my treatment options? should i share my results with my doctor and see what she thinks?
Answer: hi just google natural ways out of depression and your find lots of help there. good luck
Expected Response: the low estrogen level could be the result of stress hormones on the brain and not early menopause. depression can cause alterations in the complex interaction of hormones that result in monthly periods. restoring balance into your life by treating depression might be all you need to regularize your periods. yet other hormones should also be analyzed. simple blood or urine test are needed to determine whether this is the result of depression or something directly hormonal. premature ovarian failure elevated prolactin levels thyroid disease etc occasionally more specialized stimulation test are needed as is a referral to a hormone specialist such as an endocrinologist or reproductive endocrinologist. for now protecting your bones is utterly important until a definite diagnosis is made. a diet rich in calcium vitamin d and estrogen are considerations to prevent bone loss and restore periods. birth control is an option given your age but a more intensive evaluation is needed first.

Question: the zoloft my doctor prescribed five weeks ago isn't working. i've been referred to a psychiatrist. what can i expect?
Answer: if you have a history of depression you may be experiencing a range of symptoms. you may also be experiencing anxiety. depression is not a medical emergency. it can be treated with medication.
Expected Response: psychiatrists unlike psychologists don't usually use any type of formal questionnaire/tests. it's usually just an interview that can be as long as one hour or as short as 15 minutes. this can be an indication of nothing really and depending on where you go it can be an indication of how long the patient waiting list currently happens to be. of course you have problems and the psychiatrist expects you to have them because you're being referred by someone. so that's a given. the fact that your med hasn't worked in five weeks may indicate that it's too low a dose or isn't the med for you. all of this depends on the psychiatrist's experience and training.

Question: after a aortic dissection (15 years) with warfarin usage can i take cialis for ed? . this question is regarding cialis usage. 15 years ago i had an aortic dissection affecting my ascending and descending aorta and both carotids. i take warfarin a beta blocker asthma and cholesterol medications. can i safely take cialis?
Answer: yes. warfarins are safe to take with a prescription. they are also safe to use for ed. i would not recommend taking warfarir to treat ed. you should consult your doctor first before taking warfir.
Expected Response: that is a question only your cardiologist can answer. with your complicated heart history no one on a public forum like this should be giving you advice on the subject because we do not know your complete personal medical history. that said don't be shy about discussing the issue with your cardiologist. he or she will welcome your question and be able to give you personalized advice -- and even a prescription if it's safe for you to take the medication. you have nothing to lose by consulting your heart doctor. wishing you well!

Question: what vitamin can i use to prevent hair loss? . i lose lots of hair while i wash and brushing my hair. nothing has been changed in my diet and or in my daily regimen. . i did travel internationally for a month in july thru aug. i am 45 yrs of age female. i did take all the precautions (i. e. vitamins required shots and malaria pills). . please help!
Answer: hi if your not getting your hair back then you could just try to get a good diet that is healthy and healthy for you. but you will need to get your hair out of the way if you are not getting it back then its a bit of a grey area. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi try these for help. vitamin e is vital to scalp circulation and cell regeneration both necessary for hair growth. the daily recommended dose is 15 to 19mg. vitamin c is a natural antioxidant and helps maintain healthy hair. it aids in synthesis of collagen and is readily available in the diet. the daily recommended dose is 90 to 120mg. biotin deserves special mention. it is also a b vitamin but its importance in the role of hair growth cannot be overstated. while it can be consumed it was once said by clinical researcher andrew lessman that thousands of calories would have to be eaten to get the amount of biotin needed to make a difference. it promotes hair growth and is crucial to prevent hair dryness. the daily recommended dose is 30mcg. b complex just as the name suggests the bs are complex. there are many of them and some of them depend on one another in order to function. b12 can be responsible for hair loss by itself simply due to a deficiency. frequently injections of b12 can resolve hair loss issues. it is not stored well by the body and is required for the body's use of oxygen and for metabolism. it is needed for activation of b6 and helps in creating niacin. b12 is most absorbable when taken with vitamin c and the daily recommended dose is 50mg. b6 is also thought to prevent hair loss. it also aids in hair coloring and has a major role in creation of niacin which is needed for healthy circulation. b6 must be entirely obtained through diet or supplementation because the human body cannot synthesize it by itself. the daily recommended dose ranges from 1. 3 to 2mg. b3 also known as niacin is thought to reduce cholesterol in the scalp which inhibits hair growth. it is also essential for healthy blood circulation to the body and scalp. the daily recommended dose is 16 to 18mg. vitamin a is an antioxidant that aids in scalp oil production. it's important to note that excess amounts of vitamin a can have undesirable effects by inhibiting hair growth and can even be toxic. the daily recommended dose is 5 000 iu however the linus pauling institute of oregon university has noted increased risk of developing bone diseases such as osteoporosis associated with 5 000iu intake and therefore some supplement manufacturers have reduced content to 2 500i this above info come from livestrong com once a month you could also try giving your hair the olive oil treatment leave it on for a hour before washing it out great for hair health. do hope this helps you and your hair. good luck

Question: what are the chances of becoming pregnant while using a contraceptive and no condom?
Answer: hi yes you can get pregnant if you have unprotected sex with someone who has a condom. but if you are having unprotected sex then yes you could get pregnant. but do keep in mind condoms are not 100% effective. just remember safe sex is the best sex. good luck
Expected Response: they say the odds are like 0. 1%. personally i lack faith in that since my oldest niece and my youngest son were conceived on birth control without missing any pills. but it is unlikely. but a condom is still important. birth control does not protect from stds. so unless you know for a fact that your partner is free of all stds its always best to use a condom.

Question: pregnancy complications after bj. in the morning my girlfriend actually wanked me out and i ejaculated in tissues. throughout the whole day i urinated for only once and after that at night she started giving me a bj(without ejaculation but i supposed with some pre cum) then we actually french kissed and i started licking her private part. . this was our first time doing and she and i are actually virgin. can i know whats the likelihood of her being pregnant? i am really stressed out as i am afraid that she will be pregnant.
Answer: hi ok your find it very hard to get pregnant after having unprotected sex. so if you have unprotected sex you have to take a pregnancy test and if it is negative it means you are not pregnant. but if you are pregnant and you have sex with a condom you can get pregnant if you use one. but remember it is best to use a condom at the time you get your period. good luck
Expected Response: but according to most researches pre cum doesnt have that much of sperm counts if compared to semen itself or would i say some would also say that there's barely sperm in pre cum. do you have any findings that can prove your saying? so that i feel much convinced? also its been 2 weeks since the incident and my girlfriend has no symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea back pain vomiting frequent urination and darkening of the areola.

Question: why do i have gray pubic hair at the age of 43?
Answer: gray pubis is a common skin condition that is often referred to as "gray hair" because it is a darker color. gray hair is caused by the accumulation of pigment in the hair follicles. the hair is also a thick layer of pigment that can be difficult to remove. gray hairs can be caused by many things including: sun exposure. the sun can make the hair darker and it can make it more difficult to grow. the skin can also become more wrinkled. the darker the skin the more wrinkles and blemishes it can cause. the pigment in your hair can also be made worse by the sun. the more you wear the darker your hair will become. the thicker your skin the darker it will become and the more likely it is to become wrinkled or blemished. the longer your hair is in your scalp the more it can grow.
Expected Response: i don't know. the greying and whiting of hair is usually genetically determined so blame it on your parents or grand-parents. my head hair turned grey in my 30's and by my mid-40's i was as white as snow. if you don't like grey pubic hair shave it off. or dye it a different color. or just ignore it as part of our progressive aging cycle.

Question: how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?
Answer: crock pots are a great way to make healthy food and you can use them as a great starting point for a healthy meal plan. you can also use them to make a variety of salads and other dishes that you can serve at home. you also can use crockpot-sized pot pans to make food smaller. you could also use crockspot-size pots to make some food that is smaller than you think it is. you might also use a crock-pot to make pasta or salad.
Expected Response: it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food

Answer: there are no known interactions between medications and asthma. however there are some medications that can be used to treat asthma. these include methotrexate (makirizine) tylenol (tylenol) and naproxen (tylaceton).
Expected Response: most asthma medicines are considered safe and are used in children. for example albuterol is sometimes used in babies and young infants if they have an asthma type reaction. speak to your doctor about your specific medicines to get more information. most medications used to treat asthma appear to be safe especially those that have been around for many years and have been time-tested. unfortunately it is very difficult to conduct adequate studies in pregnant women to prove the safety of drugs.

Question: does breastfeeding protect babies from the flu virus?
Answer: the flu is caused by the influenza virus. the flu can be transmitted by direct contact with the nasal passages of a person who has the flu. the virus can also be spread through direct contact in the lungs. the best way to prevent the spread of the flu to others is to avoid contact with people who have the flu or who have an active virus. if you have had the flu you should be able to get the flu vaccine now. if your doctor doesn't want you to have the vaccine he or she can give you the vaccine. if the flu isn't contagious you should get it at the same time every day.
Expected Response: there are many ways that breastfeeding and breast milk protect babies' health. flu can be very serious in young babies. babies who are not breastfed get sick from infections like the flu more often and more severely than babies who are breastfed. mothers pass on protective antibodies to their baby during breastfeeding. antibodies are a type of protein made by the immune system in the body. antibodies help fight off infection.

Question: how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?
Answer: the diagnosis of hypothyroids is based on the fact that the thyroid gland is located in the abdomen and the body's own production of thyroid hormones is controlled by the body. the thyroid glands are located in several different locations. the most common locations are the lower abdomen and abdomen. the lower abdominal area is the most important for the production of the thyroid hormone. the abdomen is also important for thyroid hormone production. the higher abdominal area can be the most critical for the thyroid hormones.
Expected Response: if you have symptoms of hypothyroidism your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. these may include: thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) t4 (thyroxine) lower-than-normal t4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. however some people may have increased tsh levels while having normal t4 levels. this is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. it is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. if your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan to check for nodules or inflammation.

================================================================================
Question: is hpv contagious?
Answer: hpv is a viral infection that causes a person to get a viral illness. it is spread by direct contact with infected people. it can be spread by kissing or touching infected people or by spreading a contagious disease such as chicken pox. it may also be spread through contact with contaminated clothing or food. it also may be spread from contaminated clothing to other people by touching contaminated surfaces such as clothing or shoes. hpv does not cause the same symptoms as chickenpox.
Expected Response: hpv or human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted disease. it's usually detected as warts in the genital area of women and men. hpv is a serious disease that can cause several types of cancer including cervical cancer. hpv most certainly is contagious. hpv is transmitted by direct sexual contact with a person who has the virus. unfortunately many people who have hpv do not know it because they have no symptoms. using a condom during sexual encounters may help minimize your risk of getting hpv from a sex partner. two vaccines have been developed in recent years that can protect you from getting hpv. the vaccines will not cure hpv if you already have it. the centers for disease control and prevention recommend young women and men receive the vaccine to protect against getting and spreading hpv. you may want to speak with your healthcare provider to get more information about hpv and the two vaccines. hpv is contagious. there is a vaccine for girls but there is not one for boys. also i don't think there is a test that males can take to find out if they have hpv - but there is one for girls.

Question: how does touch impact my sleep?
Answer: the touch of your hand on your skin can affect your sleep. you may notice that your skin feels numb or sore. this could be a sign of a cold or flu or a cold sore. it could also be a symptom of an allergic reaction. if you have a cold you may feel a burning sensation in your hands or feet. this may be a warning sign of an allergy or a skin reaction.
Expected Response: what do i mean by touch? well touch is everything from sheets to your mattress and to your pillow. there’s lots of different theories and thoughts out there but one of the things i can tell you is that if you’re not comfortable on the surface on which you sleep and the system in which you sleep you will get a bad night’s rest. and that’s one of the things i talk about with my my boomers is you know let’s make that bed as comfortable as possible. most people don’t know this statistic and it’s kind of gross but so i’m gonna warn you but the weight of your mattress will double every 7 to 8 years based on oil sweat and dust mites. it’s pretty gross but the truth of that matter is people don’t change their mattress enough. you can only imagine what this does to your pillow. so you need to be changing your pillow probably about once every 18 – 24 months you need to be changing your mattress about every 7 years. sheets are another factor. the truth of the matter is sheets anything over 450 threads it’s almost impossible to get more than 450 – 500 threads in a square inch and that’s how they measure sheets by thread counts. there is a thread count myth out there. if you buy a 1 000 thread count sheet it’s actually 2 500 thread count woven together. so it may last a little bit longer but it’s not going to get you any softer than a 450 to 500 thread count sheet.
================================================================================
Question: how can i prevent a sting reaction?
Answer: you can prevent a stinging reaction by using a product called proton pump inhibitors (pms) such as zyrtec or tylenol. these medications are used to treat a variety of conditions such as asthma asthma and other allergies. if you are taking them for a period of time or if you have a history of asthma you may want to talk to your doctor about using a different product.
Expected Response: to avoid a serious reaction to a bee or wasp sting carry a bee-sting kit (be sure you know how to administer a self-injection). you should also wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace describing your allergy. if you have had a severe reaction to a sting and a positive venom skin test venom immunotherapy -- a series of weekly shots of venom -- works well to prevent anaphylaxis. reduce your chances of being stung by avoiding brightly colored white or pastel clothing. don't use cosmetics or perfume with floral scents. food odors attract insects especially yellow jackets so be alert when you are cooking or eating outdoors.
================================================================================
Question: what is the common cold and what causes it?
Answer: common cold is caused by viruses. viruses are viruses that live in the respiratory system. viruses can cause colds in a variety of ways. viruses that cause cold sores can cause a sore throat cough or sore throat. viruses in the airways can cause the common nasal virus (nasal herpes) to cause cold symptoms. viruses also can cause nasal congestion and nasal congestion can be caused by a cold. viruses may also cause the cold sore. cold sorsens are usually caused by bacteria that live on the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. colds can also occur from viruses that are spread by direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has a cold or from viruses in a person's mouth. viruses cause cold and other respiratory illnesses in about 1% of people in the united states. cold viruses are contagious. viruses do not cause pneumonia or other respiratory problems.
Expected Response: the common cold is a self-limited contagious illness that can be caused by a number of different types of viruses. the common cold is medically referred to as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. symptoms of the common cold may include cough sore throat nasal congestion runny nose and sneezing. more than 200 different types of viruses are known to cause the common cold with rhinovirus causing approximately 30%-35% of all adult colds. other commonly implicated viruses include coronavirus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. because so many different viruses can cause a cold and because new cold viruses constantly develop the body never builds up resistance against all of them. for this reason colds are a frequent and recurring problem. in fact children in preschool and elementary school can have six to 12 colds per year while adolescents and adults typically have two to four colds per year. the common cold occurs most frequently during the fall and winter months. the common cold is the most frequently occurring illness in the world and it is a leading cause of doctor visits and missed days from school and work. it is estimated that individuals in the united states suffer 1 billion colds per year with approximately 22 million days of school absences recorded annually.

Question: can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?
Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: why do you take some medicines on an empty stomach and at the same time every day?
Answer: most helpful answer it is not recommended to take any medication that is not on your empty stomach. it is recommended to use a food-safe food-based medicine when you are not on any medications.
Expected Response: some medications have to be taken on an empty stomach because it helps the medication dissolve and get into your bloodstream quicker. certain medications need to be taken around the same time every day so you have a consistent level in your bloodstream and body. a good example of this is blood pressure medications -- you should take your dose at the same time each day so you benefit from the medication. if you ever have any questions about how to take your medications ask your pharmacist. we are happy to help.

Question: i have another question for rod moser pa phd re: partial hysterectomy question previously posted. the person who presented the story about the 40 yr old woman w partial hysterectomy is very distraught over losing this child they even named her. he never was at any appts with her she said she had an ultrasound but there was no pic he has seen no pregnancy test or labs. he says she has 2 small incisions one by the belly button and one on her left side. is there any medical documentation he could ask for to prove her story? . thank you.
Answer: hi its a good question for you to ask and it would be best you get some help from a good urologist. good luck
Expected Response: sometimes a person wants to be pregnant so desperately that their brain creates a false-pregnancy. i had one patient who had a complete hysterectomy that even sent out birth announcements and started wearing pregnancy clothes. she wanted a miracle birth where none could exist. could it be that this person was experiencing a similar false-pregancy and a "loss" of that pregnancy? this person may have lost a "child" that never really existed except in her own mind. i do not know any of the details of this case as you know so i can only speculate. if there is medical evidence like ultrasound results pregnancy tests etc. only she has the right to reveal it. or not. she may need some psychological help not trouble her for documentation to prove or disprove her story. she has experienced a loss but perhaps the loss was her inability to ever have a child because of the hysterectomy. this can be very very difficult for a woman who wanted a child so desperately that her mind may have created one. i trust that you will approach this with sensitivity and understanding. my heart goes out to all of you.

Question: i ache all the time mostly my neck shoulders arms and hands and tired all the time. bloodwork came back good. i have a cold and i am not getting any sleep. i am a diabetic. i had a blood test and it came back negative. i do not have insurance. i just need a plan.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a tough situation for anyone to deal with. i'd suggest you see a health care provider or a registered dietitian to get a better idea of what's going on. it could be a heart attack or a stroke or even a stroke-related condition. you need to see your medical provider right away to make sure you're getting enough nutrients and a good diet. you can also try a dietitical approach. you could try a variety of different types of foods and beverages like yogurt and fruits and vegetables. you might also try some herbal remedies like tamarind or ky jelly. you may
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. the symptoms you're describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue. spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age (though i don't know how old you are) and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone. either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs. i'd suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted. blood work won't help diagnose a spinal injury or degenerative disc disease. i wish you all the best! i suffer the same symptons pains in the neck and both shoulders leading down to the top of my left arm i have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis and spondylitis in my hips and knees i have always had trouble with slipped discs and repetitive strains don't help the matter i have tried tramadol robaxing nurofen codeine and paracetomol. the symptons you have mentioned does probably lead to an injured disc which you may of done recently or some time ago get checked out by a chiropractor or ask your doctor to refer you for physio i am waiting on results from mri scan to determine what damage i have done. hope this helps

Question: will a doctor even perform a sonogram 10 days from sexual conception? . ex gfriend sent me a pic of a sonogram she said was taken 10 days after we had sex showing a very visible yoke sac and tiny fetus connected to the side of it. i was told it was a testicular cancer.
Answer: hi it is possible to have a testicle cancer but you will need to see your doctor for a test. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer you cannot see a fetus at ten days after conception so i would be a very suspicious about this sonogram. no one really does a sonogram this soon. most of time you don't even have a positive pregnancy test yet.

Question: what causes acne?
Answer: acne is a condition that is caused by a combination of several factors. it is caused when the skin cells become damaged from sun exposure and the sun's rays are not able to penetrate the skin. acne is also caused by the aging process and the aging of the skin's cells. the skin is made up of two layers of cells called the dermis and the skin contains several layers of skin cells called dermis. the dermal layers of the derm are made up mostly of the same cells. these layers are called the skin cell layers and the derms are made of different cells. when the derma layer is damaged the dermatophytes (dermis) of the cells that make up the dermi become inactive and are unable to repair themselves. when a derm layer is removed the dermitophytes become inactive again and the cells in the dermas are damaged. the cells of the dermatophytes are made from the same cell layers. when
Expected Response: acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease. normally acne develops between the age of 12-25 years. however acne is not limited to any particular age group. as people grow and become older or in younger people acne is becoming a point of concern. acne is known as the disease of the pilosebaceous units (psus). psus are found underneath the skin surface but are more in number on the face back and chest. psus consist of oil glands (sebaceous gland). these oil glands secrete oil to the skin which makes skin moisturized and soft. but in case of any pathophysiological changes in these glands due to external or internal factors can lead to acne this can be either be blackheads or whiteheads. for more information on this you can visit drugsdropship24. the acne triggering factors are listed below: oil glands are over stimulated by increase secretion of sex hormones called androgens that release in both boys and girls during adolescence. diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome and cushing's syndrome hormonal changes due to menstruation pregnancy or hormonal therapy like birth control pills cosmetic mostly moisturizers and oily preparations genetics pathogenic invasion like propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis secondary physical factors such as diet personal hygiene (dirt sweat) and stress incidence of acne on the basis of age: acne affects 90% teenagers. acne generally begins with the onset of adolescence when androgen concentration begins to increase in the body on the basis of gender: acne is more common in males than females during puberty. however during adulthood due to hormonal changes women become prone to acne.

Question: does penile massage work. i am a 56 yr old male and have had shrinkage over the last year. does the massage help or is there anything possible to stop it and bring it back to what was normal. this just might be a very stupid? but very concerened.
Answer: no. penile stimulation is not an effective treatment for shrinkage. shrinkage is caused by the aging of the penis. it can be caused by many things including stress hormones or other conditions. it is important to see a medical professional for a proper examination and treatment.

Question: i see that aloe is in my diet pill i thought that was for wounds. is it safe and does it work?
Answer: aloe (lactobacillus) is a bacterium that can cause skin infections. it is not considered a food additive. it can cause a variety of skin infections including eczema and eczemias. aloe can also cause skin cancer and other skin problems. if you have any questions about aloe products or products that are not covered by your health insurance you should talk to your health care provider.
Expected Response: actually. aloe is a product that topically is okay but when you take it orally it's not. we have found out that it is a very very strong laxative and oral use shouldn't really not happen. so i would advise this patient to not take that product at all and avoid it. aloe can be a weight loss regimen because it has the ability to clean the colon. cleaning out the colon will definitely improve your energy level and can make your weight loss efforts more productive. no surgery fat process - <link>

Question: what other conditions can cause dementia?
Answer: dementia is a condition in which the brain is unable to process information. it is thought to be caused by a number of conditions including: epilepsy. this condition is thought of as a result of a genetic defect in the brain. the brain has a hard shell called the brain wall that blocks information from reaching the body. a person with dementia can have a hardening of the shell. a stroke. a brain tumor. a nerve disease. a condition called shingles. dementia can be caused when the body's immune system attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord. the immune system destroys the nerve cell and releases chemicals that damage the nerve tissue. the damage to nerve tissue causes the body to stop functioning. dementia is caused by viruses or bacteria. it can also be caused from a genetic mutation in the gene that controls a gene called dna. the genetic mutation causes the brain to produce fewer neurons. the disease can also cause a person to have dementia
Expected Response: doctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. many of these conditions are reversible with appropriate treatment. reactions to medications. medications can sometimes lead to reactions or side effects that mimic dementia. these dementia-like effects can occur in reaction to just one drug or they can result from drug interactions. they may have a rapid onset or they may develop slowly over time. metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. thyroid problems can lead to apathy depression or dementia. hypoglycemia a condition in which there is not enough sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion or personality changes. too little or too much sodium or calcium can also trigger mental changes. some people have an impaired ability to absorb vitamin b12 which creates a condition called pernicious anemia that can cause personality changes irritability or depression. tests can determine if any of these problems are present. nutritional deficiencies. deficiencies of thiamine (vitamin b1) frequently result from chronic alcoholism and can seriously impair mental abilities in particular memories of recent events. severe deficiency of vitamin b6 can cause a neurological illness called pellagra that may include dementia. deficiencies of vitamin b12 also have been linked to dementia in some cases. dehydration can also cause mental impairment that can resemble dementia. infections. many infections can cause neurological symptoms including confusion or delirium due to fever or other side effects of the body's fight to overcome the infection. meningitis and encephalitis which are infections of the brain or the membrane that covers it can cause confusion sudden severe dementia withdrawal from social interaction impaired judgment or memory loss. untreated syphilis also can damage the nervous system and cause dementia. in rare cases lyme disease can cause memory or thinking difficulties. people in the advanced stages of aids also may develop a form of dementia (see hiv-associated dementia page 14). people with compromised immune systems such as those with leukemia and aids may also develop an infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). pml is caused by a common human polyomavirus jc virus and leads to damage or destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells. pml can lead to confusion difficulty with thinking or speaking and other mental problems. subdural hematomas. subdural hematomas or bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer covering (the dura) can cause dementia-like symptoms and changes in mental function. poisoning. exposure to lead other heavy metals or other poisonous substances can lead to symptoms of dementia. these symptoms may or may not resolve after treatment depending on how badly the brain is damaged. people who have abused substances such as alcohol and recreational drugs sometimes display signs of dementia even after the substance abuse has ended. this condition is known as substance-induced persisting dementia. brain tumors. in rare cases people with brain tumors may develop dementia because of damage to their brains. symptoms may include changes in personality psychotic episodes or problems with speech language thinking and memory. anoxia. anoxia and a related term hypoxia are often used interchangeably to describe a state in which there is a diminished supply of oxygen to an organ's tissues. anoxia may be caused by many different problems including heart attack heart surgery severe asthma smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation high-altitude exposure strangulation or an overdose of anesthesia. in severe cases of anoxia the patient may be in a stupor or a coma for periods ranging from hours to days weeks or months. recovery depends on the severity of the oxygen deprivation. as recovery proceeds a variety of psychological and neurological abnormalities such as dementia or psychosis may occur. the person also may experience confusion personality changes hallucinations or memory loss. heart and lung problems. the brain requires a high level of oxygen in order to carry out its normal functions. therefore problems such as chronic lung disease or heart problems that prevent the brain from receiving adequate oxygen can starve brain cells and lead to the symptoms of dementia.

Question: can an antihistamine allergy pill be taken with high blood pressure medication?
Answer: hi if you have an allergy to anything you can take this at night if you are not taking it you could try taking an antifungal. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: most antihistamines are safe to use with medications for high blood pressure. but i would avoid the ones that also contain a decongestant as these may raise blood pressure. i would need to know which medications you take in order to provide a more precise answer. you should talk to your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medications especially if you have high blood pressure.

Question: is coffee healthy for kids? . how much is. to. . much?
Answer: it depends on the age of the child. a child is 5 years old and has a few months of sleep. the more you have the greater the impact of caffeine. children who have a family history of caffeine-related illness may have a higher risk of developing a caffeine-induced sleep disorder. this risk is higher for children who are older than age 4. it is also higher for those who have had a caffeine related illness.
Expected Response: children rarely need the stimulant effects from coffee. i see nothing wrong with coffee being available in high schools to keep teenagers awake during afternoon math classes but i cannot see toddlers or younger children walking around with a cup of coffee. they don't need it and who really wants children to be more hyper? is it healthy for kids? probably not. caffeine zips them up and speeds up their little hearts. it is harmful? probably not but there have been little or no studies to back this up.

Question: i've had chest/neck/back pain recently with bad headaches does this sound like stress or something more? . last night i had a lot of chest and back pain with no apparent cause. i have been having neck aches and headaches over the past week and i know it wasn't a panic attack (i've had them before). is this just stress related or should i be more concerned? about 2 months ago i got a new job which has been a stressful adjustment. i've also been very tired recently and it almost feels like my brain isn't working correctly. it's like i can feel something is missing mentally that used to be there. i'm just wondering if this is something more serious or just a head cold.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like stress is a big part of your anxiety and it's important you take steps to help yourself cope with it. there are plenty of things that can cause anxiety and you need to be
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're suffering like this. it's bad enough to take on a new job without then coming down with mysterious physical symptoms! unfortunately it's impossible to tell whether this is serious or not. obviously you should know the symptoms of a heart attack and also know the risk factors for heart disease. while anyone can have a heart attack it's more likely among people with multiple risk factors. i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to evaluate your symptoms. your provider probably will want to run some tests such as blood work or possibly and ekg. many medical conditions could cause the symptoms you describe including low thyroid. your health care provider can correlate your health history with your new symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis. i hope you feel better soon!

Question: i had anterior cervical discectomy & fusion 2 weeks ago now having severe pain between shoulder blades. normal? . had discs c4 and c5 c6-c7 removed. mesh was put around spinal column titanium plates and screws applied. i am now having severe pain between my shoulder blades. is this normal?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very painful. it's important to note that this is not an emergency. you're not likely to have an emergency in the event of an accident. if you're experiencing pain in the shoulder blades of your right arm this is likely a sign of a spinal fusion. this fusion can occur in the anterior cervical area. if it's not an urgent emergency you should seek medical attention immediately. you may need to see a cardiologist to rule out a spinal fracture. wishing you well!
Expected Response: it's always concerning to have unexpected after-effects from surgery. the pain you're describing isn't unusual after an anterior cervical discectomy. the surgical positioning for that procedure can cause upper back muscle stiffness and soreness that lingers. in addition sometimes as the previously compressed spinal nerves come back to life they can cause tingling shooting or stabbing pain in areas where sensation previously was limited. all that said if your post-surgical pain is getting worse instead of better it's always a good idea to call your surgeon's office and speak to the nurse or physician assistant (pa). he or she can tell you what's expected in terms of pain and the general course of recovery. best of luck to you!

Question: 3 questions: does pheromone sprays work does ion/power bracelets work does penis enlargement pills/exercises work?
Answer: yes. there are no prescription or over-the-counter penis enlargers.
Expected Response: no these are all basically worthless "quack" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain.

Question: i took my blood pressure meds this morning but it's still very high could i take a second pill?
Answer: i would not take a third or fourth dose of a medication. i would take a blood pressure medication like zyrtec.

Question: can fibromyalgia cause profuse sweating? . i have fibromyalgic arthritis and i have been suffering from fatigue and fatigue related to the disease. i have had a lot of pain and discomfort in my legs and back. i also have a lot more stress and anxiety than usual. i am also tired and have a hard time sleeping. i can't sleep at all. i feel like i'm going to die.
Answer: i am not sure what you mean by "profuse sweating" but i can tell you that it is not a symptom of fibromyopathy. i would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: sweating problems are common in fm because of the autonomic nerve dysfunction. the sweat glands receive nerve supply from specific autonomic nerves called sympathetic sudomotor nerves. sweating regulates our body temperature (called thermoregulation). in fm dysutonomia is present and causes too much sweating usually but sometimes the opposite occurs and our skin can be too dry. throw in the usual suspects that overstimulate our autonomics: weather changes heat sunlight certain meds esp ssri's & snri's position changes i. e. laying down stress exercise attempts etc. and we become bona fide sweating machines! treatments for excessive sweating are limited. i advise my patients to avoid aggravating factors if they can use antiperspirants not deodorants and sometimes an anti-cholinergic medicine can be tried. work with your doc.

Question: i have contact dermatitis. is there an over-the-counter ointment that i could buy to help heal this up?
Answer: i don't know the name of the over- the-counter product but i have heard that it can be used to treat psoriasis. it is not a topical ointments but rather a combination of topical and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). you can buy a prescription ointmented ointmentation cream at pharmacies or online at www. franktalkshop. com. you can also order online at franktalk. com/shop.
Expected Response: this is a popular question that i get at the pharmacy. typically the topical hydrocortisone products are very effective to use as long as the skin isn't broken or bleeding. if the itching is really bothersome an antihistamine like benadryl or zyrtec may be appropriate as well. be sure to have your medication list handy when you are talking to the pharmacist and let us know any other over-the-counter products you may have tried already too so we can help make the best decision.

Question: if my girlfriend has mrsa on (or in) her bartholin gland could i get it from us having sex? . hi there . my girlfriend said something about having mrsa on the glands in her vagina that make natural lubrication which i am assuming are the bartholin glands. my question for you is: if we have sex is it possible for me to contract it from her? this might be a silly question but i am actually kind of worried about it. thank you for the help!
Answer: yes. mrsas are naturally occurring in the vagina. if your girlfriend has a urinary tract infection (uti) she may be at increased risk of getting it. if you are having sex with someone who has mri or uti it would be wise to get tested for it. it is not likely to be mrsal but it can be. it can also be caused by a variety of things. it could be a urinary infection. it may also be

Question: runny nose took antihistamine. developed fever. reaction to drug or cold/allergy symptom? . took over the counter diphenhydramine hci 25 mg. no fever prior to taking it but i had a bad runny nose. it started out with a little white/dark yellowish discharge but now it's gotten worse. it's been a week now and i'm still not feeling well.
Answer: hi its just a couple of days of mild cough and you should be fine then. good luck
Expected Response: benadryl (diphenhydramine) does not cause a fever nor is fever an adverse reaction to this antihistamine. allergies do not cause fever so any elevation in temperature that may have experienced is most likely do to your cold (assuming you have correctly diagnosed yourself). fever is the body's natural response to fighting off an infection.

Question: are all-in-one shampoo and conditioners as healthy for my hair as washing with separate shampoos and conditioners?
Answer: no. these products are not "natural" so you can't use them in the shower.
Expected Response: these conditioning shampoos are designed to clean and condition in a single step. they may have both a negative charge and a positive charge so they can clean and condition at different ph values. they are best for persons with chemically treated hair or those who like to shampoo often. they work well for oily hair and are certainly as healthy for your hair as washing with a separate shampoo and conditioner.

Question: what is my risk for hiv? i am white heterosexual male that had vaginal intercourse with a white female. i am concerned because the condom we were using broke. i immediately felt it break and pulled out and reapplied a brand new condom. the next morning i woke up and i looked down at my penis and the very tip of my penis had some minor abrasions which i did not notice the night before. they were not bleeding or anything just looked like scrapes. so for a few seconds my penis and its abrasions were exposed to vaginal fluids. what is my risk? i have hsv-2 is it possible these scrapes were from that?
Answer: hi its a good question to ask your doctor but for now just google natural ways out of hiv and natural ways to get rid of it its all there. good luck

Question: blue cross guarantees health insurance rates for 6 months. is there a limit on how much the rate can be raised?
Answer: the federal government has set a cap on the amount of premium that can be charged for a plan purchased through the marketplace. if the federal marketplace is expanding its offerings you'll be able to purchase a plan through the exchange. if you're a new individual with a pre-existing condition the cap will be less than the amount you'll pay for a health plan. if your income is below the poverty level you'll likely qualify for a subsidy to help pay for coverage. if that's the case you'll qualify for medicaid. if it's less than $12 000 you'll also qualify for the affordable care act.
Expected Response: any insurer that raises rates more than 10% will have to justify that increase under the law. in some states insurance departments can deny insurers the right to raise rates higher than that in others they can't. in recent history however insurers have backed down under the scrutiny.

Question: my daughter’s permanent eye teeth are coming in over the top of her baby teeth. what can we do to loosen the baby teeth?
Answer: there are several techniques that can be used to loosen baby teeth that are not very effective. first you can use a toothbrush to loosen them. you can also use a dental brush to remove the baby's teeth. if you have a permanent eye infection (such as a herpes virus) you can try using a toothpaste or toothpaste-based toothpaste. if the baby has a very large toothbrush (such a toothpicks) you may want to use a soft toothbrush. this will help loosen the toothbrush and will help prevent future tooth-related tooth decay. if your baby has an ear infection you can add a tooth comb to the ear canal. this can help loosen and re-open the ear.
Expected Response: if they are loose you can wiggle them until they come out. but the best answer is to take her to your dentist for an evaluation. if the adult eye teeth are not erupting properly the dentist may recommend treatment that could help to avoid problems later in life.

Question: can your lungs be ruptured if you cracked a rib? . i had a rib broken 2 years ago. i had it removed and it is now broken again. i have been coughing up a lot of mucus.
Answer: you should not have a rib fracture. you should have a full-term (and permanent) rib replacement.
Expected Response: well not exactly. the lung doesn't "rupture " exactly. it can collapse though. this is called " pneumothorax. " a broken rib can indeed puncture your lung. in fact it's not all that uncommon. if you watch any of those real-life trauma shows on television you will see emergency room personnel placing chest tubes in patients due to collapsed lungs and you can bet some of those collapses occurred due to fractured ribs. but if by "cracked" you mean "not completely fractured or displaced " then the answer probably is "no. " when a rub breaks and the two sides pull away from each other then one of them can puncture the lung. if a rib is "cracked" but the ends never comes apart then it's unlikely to penetrate the tissue surrounding the lung. on the other hand if you took a forceful blow to the chest that alone could cause a collapsed (not "ruptured") lung. so if you experienced chest trauma sufficient to crack a rib you certainly could experience a pneumothorax. surprisingly you can experience a collapsed lung without any known cause whatsoever. wishing you well!

Question: if a person has hepatitis c can they also get hepatitis a and/or b?
Answer: there are no specific rules for people who are infected with hepatitis c. however there are a number of factors that can influence whether or not you can get hepatitis c if you have the disease. hepatitis c is not contagious. it can be passed from person to person and it can spread from person. if you are infected you can also get hcv.
Expected Response: yes hep c does not prevent these and can be very complicated if you get hep a the vaccine for hep a and hep b are recommended for all hep c patients. it is possible to get different geno types of hep c. anyone with hep c should see a gasto/hepatologist and get informed on the types of hep c and the best method to treat and what to avoid.
================================================================================
Question: what are the symptoms of hepatitis c?
Answer: hepatitis c is caused by a virus that causes a virus called hcv-1. the virus can infect the liver and cause inflammation and death. the body's immune system fights the infection and destroys the virus. the immune system also fights off the infection by blocking the virus from entering the body. the liver is the main organ in the body and the body can't fight the virus with the help of other organs. the blood is the body’s main source of blood. the hepatitis c virus can also cause liver damage. it can also spread through direct contact with the blood. a person can get hepatitis c from eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. if you have a liver infection you can get it from drinking contaminated food. if your doctor says you have hepatitis c he or she may recommend that you have an x-ray to see if you are infected with the virus or if you may have an infection with the hepatitis virus.
Expected Response: hepatitis c usually doesn't cause any symptoms. but when symptoms occur they may include: fever fatigue appetite loss nausea vomiting abdominal pain dark urine clay-colored bowel movements joint pain jaundice (yellow color in the skin or eyes) "the most common symptom is probably no symptoms. but the next most common symptom would be fatigue. people just feel tired and worn out " says bruce r. bacon md director of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at st. louis university school of medicine.

Answer: hi ok you just have to google this you will find lots of info on it you just need to google it its not a lot of info you just google it and you will see lots of answers. good luck
Expected Response: the penis has never been known for its beauty and appearance so don't worry about the wrinkles since only you are probably the only one seeing it. a sexual partner is more likely to see or experience the non-wrinkled version. there are not wrinkle-removers or penis-lifts so it is what it is.

Answer: i don't know. i can't say for sure what type of vaginal infection you are having. it is possible to have vaginal infection with vaginal discharge.

Question: am i pregnant? . i'm 16. my boyfriend of two years and i haven't had sex yet. the other day we started fooling around. he fingered me first then i gave him a blowjob. i swallowed it. the next day we did the same thing except i spit it out. a week later i gave him a blowjob first and swallowed then he fingered me. we were really safe but i was suppose to start my period on the 17th and it's the 29th now. i've never missed one and they've always been pretty regular. i'm not worried about it. i just want to know if i'm pregnant.

Answer: collagen is a very important component in collagen production. it is used to build collagen structures and provide elasticity and strength. it can also be used to help smooth skin and help repair or repair wrinkles. elastins are a type of collagen that is used for skin repair. they are also used to repair or prevent wrinkles.

Question: how can i stop my dog from chewing wood? . my st bernard keeps chewing the side of his dog house (made of wood) as well as almost anything made of wood . how can i stop that? is there a product i can put on the wood? . the side of the dog house (made of wood) is also painted.
Answer: there are no products that can stop your dog from eating wood. you will need to see your veterinarian for a proper examination.
Expected Response: i'm not a vet but i have 3 dogs and 3 cats so i'll weigh in based on personal experience. there are products that you can spray on wood that make it taste bad to dogs. it makes the wood taste very bitter. one product i can think of off the top of my head is called bitter apple. however if it's a large area that might not be possible. you could ask your local pet store what products they have to see if they have something that works for a larger area. i have had good luck with those products but the problem is you have to keep using them until your dog associates the bad taste with chewing the wood. then he may just turn to something else so ultimately it might be worth finding a professional that works with behavioral issues with dogs to get some pointers and try to get to the bottom of what might be causing him to chew.

Question: can i give my daughter (she weights 30 pounds ) bromfed dm syrup along with ibuprofen?
Answer: there are no studies linking bromfent to weight loss. however it is important to note that bromfen is not the same as ibuprophen. ibuprosan is a medication that is used to treat nausea and vomiting. it is not recommended for children under age 5. ibupsan is not a substitute for a food supplement.
Expected Response: if your daughter is under six years old bromfed dm is not recommended. if she is over six you will need to get the okay from her doctor since i do not know anything about her or her medical history let alone blindly dose your daughter. the children;s ibuprofen is fine (at the correct dosage). her doctor prescribed bromfed for her. i took her to the er on monday and found out that it wasn't a virus like the dr had told me on friday. she has pneumonia and a double ear infection. now she is on zithromycin and amoxicillin and also breathing treatments. she is started to feel a little better she is starting to eat again today.

Question: i am on birth control. i experienced light bleeding for a couple of days after my cycle ended. what could be happening?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. you're certainly not alone. it's possible that you're experiencing some type of hormonal imbalance. it could be a hormonal imbalance that's causing your cycle to stop. it might be a hormone imbalance that is causing your body to stop producing enough estrogen. it may be a combination of many of the same things. it can be a pregnancy or even a birth defect. it is important to talk to your doctor about any possible causes of your symptoms. it would be best for you to see a gynecologist for a thorough examination. you can also get a blood test to see if you're pregnant. if you are not pregnant you should talk to a gynecomastia specialist to get a definitive answer. it sounds like you're on birthcontrol. if it's not working for you it could mean
Expected Response: there are a couple of possible explanations for this light spotting. the most common one would be light breakthrough bleeding due to the hormones in your birth control pill (bcp). with prolonged bcp use the lining of the uterus can become thinner. this can make it easier for spotting to occur. often such spotting will present after intercourse or even heavy exercise. typically it does not develop into a full on "period-like" bleed. other reasons for spotting after sex can include problems with the face of your cervix. for example if you have a new infection with chlamydia that can make the cervix friable (easier to bleed when touched by fingers penis etc). if you had a polyp in the cervical canal the polyp tissue is very fragile and bleeds easily. . my best guess is bcp caused spotting. if the spotting persists or you have risks for chlamydia (e. g. new partner or multiple partners) you should see your gyn of clinic for follow up. if the bcp is the culprit for the poor cycle control a change in bcp formula or brand can be helpful.

Question: what pulmonary rehab exercises can be beneficial to someone with copd?
Answer: copd is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the body’s own cells. in copd the immune system responds by blocking the production of certain types of cells. the body can fight off infection by producing antibodies that fight off the infection. copd can be treated with a variety of medications and treatments.
Expected Response: the most important part of any pulmonary rehabilitation program for copd is exercise. all pulmonary rehab centers offer exercises to improve physical fitness. some pulmonary rehab centers provide an exercise program only. other centers provide access to specialists education and psychological support in addition to exercises. pulmonary rehab exercises include: lower-body exercises: most pulmonary rehab centers provide a regimen of exercises that centers on leg workouts. these exercises vary from simple walking on a treadmill or around a track to more intense stair climbing. most of the proven benefits of pulmonary rehab come from studies in people doing leg exercises. upper-body exercises: the muscles in the upper body are important for breathing as well as daily activities. arm and chest exercises might include turning a crank against resistance or simply repetitively lifting the arms against gravity. exercises for breathing muscles: breathing through a mouthpiece against resistance during pulmonary rehab may increase the strength of the breathing muscles. these exercises are infrequently used but may be helpful for people with very weak breathing muscles. strength training : most pulmonary rehab exercises concentrate on building endurance. adding strength training like lifting weights has been shown to increase muscle strength and bulk as well.

Question: what causes eczema?
Answer: eczemias are a condition in which the skin is irritated by a fungus. these are caused by a variety of bacteria. they are caused mainly by the fungal infection called fungal varicella. fungi are found in many areas of the body including the legs arms and legs.
Expected Response: the exact cause of eczema is unknown but it's thought to be linked to an overactive response by the body's immune system to unknown triggers. in addition eczema is commonly found in families with a history of other allergies or asthma. some people may suffer "flare-ups" of the itchy rash in response to certain substances or conditions. for some coming into contact with rough or coarse materials may cause the skin to become itchy. for others feeling too hot or too cold exposure to certain household products like soap or detergent or coming into contact with animal dander may cause an outbreak. upper respiratory infections or colds may also be triggers. stress may cause the condition to worsen. the condition is not contagious and can't be spread from person to person.

Answer: the risk increases when you have rh sensitizations during pregnancy. the risk is highest during the first trimester of pregnancy. however the risk may increase during the second trimester. the most common reason for increased risk during pregnancy is a complication of the rhinitis vaccine. the vaccine is given to a child with rhinovirus infection during the third trimester and the fourth trimester when the immune system is weakened. the immune systems are weakened when the virus enters the body. the virus can cause an immune reaction that causes a change in the way the immune cells work. the rhini vaccine is not recommended for children younger than two years.
Expected Response: rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. during pregnancy an rh-negative woman can become sensitized if she is carrying an rh-positive fetus. factors that increase the risk of blood mixing and sensitization during pregnancy include: 2 delivery. abdominal trauma such as from a car accident. abdominal surgery such as a cesarean section. placenta abruptio or placenta previa both of which can cause placental bleeding. external cephalic version for a breech fetus. obstetric procedures such as amniocentesis fetal blood sampling or chorionic villus sampling (cvs). miscarriage (spontaneous abortion ) ectopic pregnancy or elective abortion (medical or surgical abortion) after 8 weeks of fetal age (when fetal blood cell production begins). partial molar pregnancy involving fetal growth beyond 8 weeks. although rare rh sensitization has been known to occur after needle sharing between intravenous drug users. transfusing rh-positive blood in an rh-negative person can also trigger sensitization. but this is extremely rare because blood is always tested prior to transfusion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how to know when cats run fevers?
Answer: cats run a very predictable pattern of fevers. they will run febs at any time of the day or night. the most common reason for this is a cat's diet. cats can be very active and run a fever. however they can run a febrile pattern at any point in the day. if you have a cat that is running a febs pattern and is not getting enough sleep it may be time to see your vet.
Expected Response: hi if a cat temperature goes up by just 1 degree over its norm its not good for it they can get a bit robotic when walking. so with a thermometer do this. lubricate the bulb tip with a little petroleum jelly lift the base of the tail and gently slide it into your cat's rectum until half of it is inside. keep it in for three minutes withdraw and check the reading. you should seek veterinary attention if your cat's temperature is under 99°f (37. 2°c) or over 104°f (40°c). hope this helps you. good luck

Question: is malaria a particular problem for children?
Answer: malaria is not a serious illness but it can be a problem for a few people. in fact the majority of people with malaria do not have symptoms. it is not uncommon for people with the disease to have a fever and cough. malaria is caused by the parasite called the tinea pedis. the parasite is spread by direct contact with blood or mucus. the tianeptis is a parasite that lives in the blood. the virus is spread from person to person through contact with the blood or other blood. it can also be transmitted by direct blood contact.
Expected Response: yes. all children including young infants living in or traveling to malaria risk areas should take antimalarial drugs (for example chloroquine and mefloquine [lariam]). although the recommendations for most antimalarial drugs are the same as for adults it is crucial to use the correct dosage for the child. the dosage of drug depends on the age and weight of the child. a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases is recommended for consultation in prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment of children. since an overdose of an antimalarial drug can be fatal all antimalarial (and all other) drugs should be stored in childproof containers well out of the child's reach.

Question: is zosyn the same as clindamycin? . 48 yr male severe tooth abcess. has heart disease.
Answer: yes. the zosin is a very effective oral antibiotic.
Expected Response: no those are two different antibiotics. zosyn is a combination of two medications -- the antibiotic piperacillin and the medication tazobactam which helps the antibiotic work better and lessen the likelihood that the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic. clindamycin is a completely different antibiotic. zosyn is given in the vein whereas clindamycin can be taken as a pill (also can be given in the vein). both antibiotics could be helpful in treating a tooth abscess depending on the bacteria causing the abscess.

Question: how can accidental of acetaminophen overdose be avoided in adults?
Answer: acetaminosapentaenoic acid (acetaminophen) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) that is used to treat pain. it is also used to prevent heart disease and stroke. acetamino-acetamino (acetamox) is also known as a "corticosteroid" or "susceptible" drug.
Expected Response: to avoid unintentional overdoses among adults here are some suggestions. read the labels of the medication bottles carefully and determine the amount or strength of acetaminophen in each pill or spoonful. become familiar with all of the other medications that you are taking. remember that over 200 drugs contain acetaminophen as one of the ingredients and that certain drugs such as phenobarbital can significantly increase liver damage. before you take the medication write down (record) the maximum safe number of pills or spoonfuls that you can ingest over 24 hours. stick to that quantity and do not deviate. if however you are unsure of the safe number of doses or think that you need to take more than you should call your doctor or pharmacist. when you receive a prescription for a new medication ask your doctor or pharmacist whether it affects the body's metabolism (processing) of the other medications that you are taking including acetaminophen. if you have been drinking alcohol regularly do not exceed taking two grams of acetaminophen over 24 hours. be honest with yourself about the ingestion of alcohol. record the number of pills or spoonfuls of acetaminophen and the time that you take them.

Question: why do new dads get depressed?
Answer: the answer to this question depends on a number of reasons. many of the reasons cited for depression are related to stress. many factors can cause depression including: stress is a social problem. it can be difficult for a new dad to cope with stress. new dads often have difficulty coping with their own problems. they may be able to cope better with other people's problems. stress can be a problem for older dads. it may be difficult to cope. it is difficult for older men to cope well with their family members. stress may also be a challenge for new dads. they have difficulty getting enough sleep. they often feel isolated or isolated. they are also more likely to be unemployed. they tend to have more problems with their job and their job-related problems.
Expected Response: you’d think any new parent would be elated to hold a precious newborn in their arms. although guys can’t blame it on their hormones sleep deprivation has a major impact on someone’s view of life. spend two (or more) months with three-hour stretches of sleep and see how you feel! some dads also get stressed about 50/50 shared parenting responsibilities. (although they are happy to help many of them don’t have their own dads as role models. ) dads’ depression symptoms often go unnoticed. that’s because men don’t cry. depressed men may act angry withdrawn or even abusive. it’s important for friends family and health care providers to identify dads with postpartum depression and encourage them to seek help.

Question: how to get fluid behind the eardrum to drain. i have been to the doctors several times and on several antibiotics and i have no pain in my ear but i cant hear from the fluid built up. what can i do?
Answer: the fluid behind your eardrums is a very important part of your body. if you have an infection or a bacterial infection you can get fluid from the eustachian tube (the tube that connects your ears to your brain) and the fluid is there to drain your eustache. the fluid can be a little bit sticky or it can be hard to clear it. you can try using a saline nasal spray to clear the fluid. this will help clear it up and also help you with the pain.
Expected Response: there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion (fluid). 1. you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent. 2. decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc. have all been used with limited success. sometimes it helps. sometimes it doesn't. antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of "plumbing and ventilation" issue. not an infection. 3. an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid (tympanostomy) or suction and place tubes in your ears. i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum. i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside-down. with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i couldn't hear much through that ear. after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube. now apparently that tube isn't there to drain liquid or it would have done so already; i bet it's just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors. whatever. it's the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it's connection to the nose. i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped. that's the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way. apparently i didn't do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it'd get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside (where the ocean was). then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction. i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube. after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear. fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear. i caution you though about the decision to have "tubes" put in the ear drum to drain this fluid. i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out. i actually had the little tiny plastic rings. they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic. most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not. i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem. i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on. many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts e-coli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water. you do not want this to fester in your ear. depending on the type of tube used scar tissue can be left behind and ear drum will not heal on it's own. so you need another surgery to attempt to have the ear drum heal. the first attempt and it is beyond me why they even do this one the surgeon roughs up the ear drum and then places a thin patch of some kind of material over the hole(s) and hope this will work. this is only 60% effective. but it's your only option. i don't like the odds but that's all i was offered. i did not sneeze nor blow my nose for two months. and i was diligent in this i did not want another surgery i wanted this to work. it did not work at all. so now if i want to pursue it i have to submit to another surgery more anesthesia. risk. and the surgeon doesn't like this one because it's "very tiny surgery" is what i was told. they have to stitch the hole closed and i would imagine it's a big pain in the you know where. so don't just jump into this surgery. especially if you are not having pain. i would try more medications give it some more time try decongestants or antihistamines to dry out the ear(s). another go with antibiotics which i know is a real pain in and of itself. but don't just jump into surgery especially if you want to be able to swim this summer. pools are a better choice because the water is chlorinated but chlorine can damage as well. you will need ear plugs to swim but that's not a 100% guarantee that water will not get into the ear. i was told to use cotton balls covered in vaseline petroleum jelly when bathing or when swimming. this is disgusting and it does not come out of your ear. so you walk around with vaseline in your ears. really think about it. when i was a little girl i had swimmers ear; water behind the ear. i went to the doctor and he told me to drop alcohol in my ear until i heard it 'fill up'. you do this by tilting you head to the opposite side that has the water and slowly drop alcohol in the ear until you hear it 'fill up'. then press a kleenex or clean cloth against that ear to restrict the exit flow of alcohol and slowly tilt your head toward the side that has the water and slowly release the alcohol from the ear. you will hear it chug chugging as it exits and the last bit of flow should feel warm; that is the trapped water. i have used this technique for years when swimming or anytime i think i have water behind my ear. it works beautifully. i have had this for a month and apart from a nasal steroid spray the doctor says it will go on it's own accord. i have tried holding my nose and blowing hard into your cheeks but you just have to keep trying. try drinking laying down as well. it's a miserable complaint.

Question: i am almost two weeks late on my period it comes 1st of every month could i be pregnant. i am almost two weeks late on my period it comes the 1st of the month every month but last month i started 1-6 then stopped and lightly bleed 15-19. and i havent started this month i am trying to conceive. took two pregnancy home test and came back negative. should i take another one in a couple days or call the doctor .
Answer: hi if you are pregnant then you need to get a test done for your hormones. if your not pregnant then get a blood test done. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: your menstrual cycle could be affected by a number of things. are you under any new stress have you started a new exercise routine have you changed your diet? all those things can cause your period to become abnormal and even cause you to spot throughout the month. there is a chance that you could be pregnant. when i was pregnant with my first child i had a normal period for the first 5 months. i would take another test in a couple of days (remember first pee of the morning is always best) if that test comes back negative i wold recommend seeing your doctor. hope this is helpful.
================================================================================
Question: is counting calories really the trick to losing weight?
Answer: calorie counting is a great way to lose weight. if you're counting calories for food you may have to add more calories to your diet. this is because calories are stored in fat cells called fat cells. when you eat more calories you burn more fat cells than you burn in fat. this means that you burn fewer calories than you actually eat. the key is to eat fewer calories to burn calories. if your body burns more calories than it burns in fat you can lose weight but you'll still be at a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. for more information about calorie counting see this webmd article.
Expected Response: healthy weight management is all about energy balance. that means burning more calories than you're consuming. so it is helpful to become familiar with the calorie counts of the foods you eat most often. keep a food diary for a couple of days and then look up the calorie counts of the foods you've eaten. you can get that information by referring to the nutrition facts panel on packaged foods or by looking online at websites like the usda national nutrient database. this will give you a sense of where your calories are coming from and help you identify some smart and easy ways to cut calories. for instance if you normally drink whole milk you can switch to fat-free milk and save 60 calories per cup. after a while you'll become a good diet detective and be able to estimate the calorie counts of your most regularly eaten foods. also remember that the higher the fat content the higher the caloric level. and of course the larger your portion the more calories you're consuming.

Question: my parents stay with me. my father has been unemployed since jan. 2013. . i have health insurance through my employer and it covers my wife. my parents are 62 and 57. can i include them in my health insurance coverage by applying on the website?
Answer: you can go to healthcare. gov to see if you qualify for a subsidy. if you do not qualify for subsidies you will need to purchase a plan through your state's marketplace. if your income is below $46 000 you will qualify for financial assistance to help pay for coverage.
Expected Response: you generally won't be able to add your parents to your employer insurance. employers have rules on who is considered a dependent and the affordable care act does not change those rules. your parents can apply for their own coverage through your state's marketplace and may qualify for a premium subsidy based on their income.

Question: my 2-yr-old son has a very red and swollen penis painful to touch. he peed without any complaints. what can this be? . he is not circumcised. he is also very very short. he has been on a lot of antibiotics for a few days. he does not have any symptoms. he also has a lot more pain than usual. he was taking a lot for his allergies. he did not have a fever.
Answer: it is very possible that your son is having a "red" penis and that he is experiencing a "chicken" reaction. this is a very common reaction to penile infections. it is not a sign of a "cold" penis. the redness may be a sign that he has a "disease" or a "pink" reaction to the penile skin. it would be best to see a medical provider for a proper examination.
Expected Response: i think you should get this looked at. whatever is causing the problem it's not normal. you may want to gently inspect the position of the foreskin. it should naturally cover the head of the penis (the glans). you should never pull the foreskin back on a boy younger than about age 5 not even to clean. at age 2 you can easily damage your son's penis by forcibly retracting (pulling back) the foreskin. at any rate a red swollen painful penis in a child is not something to take lightly. i'd suggest you put a call in to his pediatrician as soon as possible. best wishes to you both! your son has been jacking off to much tell him to stop or maybe he needs to have sex more you irresponsible parent.

Expected Response: insurance companies have to comply with new rules and cover some services they haven't had to in the past. but to have your services covered you do need to comply with the rules of your benefits package in order to get coverage. generally services must be deemed medically necessary in order to be covered.

Answer: hi if you have a hysteria you can get a herpetic hernia at your local hospital. the surgery will help you get the surgery done. but if you are still worried about getting pregnant just google hernia surgery and your find lots of info there. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i have a hernia that will be repaired in about 3 weeks and personally have not had an issue with this. however my doctor has told me and i have read that sometimes the vas deferens can become strangulated by the intestine intruding into the scrotum. the "vas" is the tube that carries the sperm. if you are having trouble and you think it may be related to your hernia see your doctor immediately as a strangulation of any kind can be very serious. read some of the categories relating to strangulation.

Answer: hi if you have been having unprotected sex you could be pregnant or just having unprotected unprotected sex. but your on the right track. good luck
Expected Response: anytime that you have unprotected sex and are not using any form of contraception you are at risk to getting pregnant. why did you have sex with your boyfriend without a condom? had he worn one you would not be freaking out right now. if you start showing any signs of pregnancy you will need to do a home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an examination. we planned it like that but i have been discharging all day and then now i am lightly bleeding so i am just wondering if i could be and im not freaking out. i want to get pregnant.

Question: what is polymerase chain reaction?
Answer: polymerase chains reaction is the process of converting the polymerase into a new enzyme. this process is called polymerase deactivating and is the mainstay of the modern medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
Expected Response: polymerase chain reaction is a method to analyze a short sequence of dna (or rna) even in samples containing only minute quantities of dna or rna. pcr is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of dna or rna. previously amplification of dna involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria and took weeks. but now with pcr done in test tubes it takes only a few hours. pcr is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the dna. moreover pcr uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying dna: two "primers" short single-stranded dna sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the dna stretch to be copied. an enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of dna reading its code and assembling a copy. a pile of dna building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy.

Question: what is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd)?
Answer: an implant is a device that is implanted in the abdomen to help you maintain a healthy weight. it is also called a "pocket implant. " an implant can be used to help with weight loss or to reduce the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Expected Response: an icd is a sophisticated device used primarily to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation two life-threatening heart rhythms. the icd constantly monitors the heart rhythm. when it detects a very fast abnormal heart rhythm it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. there are several ways the icd can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. they include: anti-tachycardia pacing (atp). when the heart beats too fast a series of small electrical impulses may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. cardioversion. a low energy shock may be delivered at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm. defibrillation. when the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly a higher energy shock may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal rhythm. anti-bradycardia pacing. many icds provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.

Question: i had partial hysterectermy for prolapse uterus. i seem to be haveing same problem again. i am concerned and worried. . i am not sure if it is prolapse or not. i have had prolapse before but never had this problem before. i also have a few other symptoms. i want to know if this is normal or not
Answer: hi if you are having a prolapse then you are in a very bad position. the prolapse is the most common cause of prolapse. prolapse can be caused by many things including things like a ruptured uterus or a rupturing uterus. prolapsed uterus is the uterus that is most likely to rupture. if you have prolapsed your prolapse will not go away. prolapses can be life threatening and can last for months or even years. if this prolapse does not go down you may need to see your doctor. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this issue especially during the holiday season! the problem here is that people use the term "partial hysterectomy " to mean different things. it can mean you had your uterus removed but not your cervix ovaries or other reproductive structures. the term "partial hysterectomy" also can be used to mean the uterus and cervix were removed but not the ovaries and fallopian tubes. because you had your uterus removed it is not possible for that organ to prolapse again. it is gone. i suppose it is possible for the cervix itself to prolapse (that is to hang down outside the vaginal opening) but this would be relatively uncommon. more common would be a possible prolapsed bladder. this can occur when the muscles that hold the urinary bladder in place become weak and the bladder collapses down into the vaginal wall. this certainly could feel the same as a prolapsed uterus and you may have symptoms such as pelvic pain difficulty urinating and tissue protruding from the vagina. i suggest you see your gynecologist or primary care provider to get this checked out. it's not a medical emergency but obviously you want to get an examination soon if only to make yourself feel better in finding out what the problem is. i wish you all the best.

Question: what can cause a white blood cell count of 20 000. i've had night sweats pain in my kidneys trouble emptying bladder weak stream i recently got blood work done the nurse informed me my white cell count was 20 000 and the doctor ordered more labs to be done but no one would tell me what's going on.
Answer: hi this is from the uk's nhs this is a list of all the tests you need to get a blood test done. if you have any questions go to www. blood test. gov or call 0330 807 607 807. you can also get a test done at home. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: is it safe to use medicine while i am trying to become pregnant?
Answer: there are no safe or effective birth control methods that contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone. however there are some birth control pills that contain both progesterones and estrogen. these pills are safe and effective for women who are trying to get pregnant.
Expected Response: it is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. once you do get pregnant you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. before you start trying to get pregnant it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. sometimes medicines should be changed and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. each woman is different. so you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own. if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant: do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.
================================================================================
Question: what causes atopic dermatitis?
Answer: atopic eczema is a skin disorder characterized by the development of dark patches of redness and inflammation on the skin. it is also called atopic conjunctivitis (atopic conjidymitis). atopic eruptions can occur when the skin is inflamed by a variety of factors including chemical irritants and medications.
Expected Response: the cause of atopic dermatitis is poorly understood and is the subject of active research. research shows that it develops as a result of interaction between the environment your immune system and genetics (heredity). people with this condition seem to have very sensitive immune systems that are more prone to react to numerous irritants and allergens. most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergic conditions such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ). the skin inflammation that causes the atopic dermatitis rash is considered a type of allergic response. research has shown that even the unaffected skin of people with atopic dermatitis does not hold water as well as it should. 2 3 itching and rash can be triggered by a variety of factors including: exposure to allergens such as pollen animal dander or molds. dust mites may be an allergen although experts don't know whether they affect atopic dermatitis. exposure to irritants such as using soaps rubbing the skin and wearing wool. exposure to workplace irritants such as fumes and chemicals. climate factors especially winter weather and low humidity. cold air does not contain much moisture which can result in drier skin and increased itchiness. temperature changes. sudden changes in temperature can result in increased itchiness. a suddenly higher temperature may bring on sweating which can cause itching. lying under blankets entering a warm room or going from a warm shower into colder air can all promote itching. emotional stress. emotions such as frustration or embarrassment may lead to increased itchiness and scratching. exposure to certain foods typically eggs peanuts milk soy or wheat products. up to 40% of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis also have some type of food allergy. 4 but experts do not agree on whether foods can cause atopic dermatitis. excessive washing. repeated washing dries out the top layer of skin leading to drier skin and increased itchiness especially in the winter months when humidity is low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how do i make a persistent dry cough go away for good? . it's been about two weeks now since i've had a cold/flu and i can't afford to go to a doctor right now. how can i treat this at home? or will i need to go see a doctor for this?
Answer: you can certainly make a "dry cough" go away by using a cough suppressant. it is not a cure but it may be a good idea. if you have a cough that is not getting better you may need to see a medical provider.
Expected Response: most helpful answer you are coughing for a reason. coughing helps clear your airway of mucous so if you are still coughing then perhaps you are still having post-nasal drainage. coughing can irritate the respiratory track so the more that you cough the more that you may feel the need to cough. assuming that you are not having signs of a secondary infection like pneumonia (fever chills rapid respiration) or an asthma-reaction (wheezing shortness of breath etc. ) you can quiet an annoying cold-related cough several ways: hydrate: drink plenty of fluids humidify: use a cool mist humidifer or at least take a steamy shower before bedtime soothe: try some honey to coat your throat suppress: you can take an over-the-counter cough suppressant that contains dextramethorophan (dm). a pharmacist can help you select a good one. try some cough drops. many contain soothing glycerine to help the irritated throat. don't leave them in your mouth at bedtime however! control post-nasal drainage. an antihistamine may help dry up a drip. avoid decongestants at bedtime (they increase post-nasal drainage) any persistent cough should be taken seriously so you may need to see a medical professional if the cough does not quiet down and completely resolve.

Question: to dr. moser i hope you read this. thank you for answering my question. some more information would be appreciated. it was a staph infection that was in his testicle area. i know the needle would've hurt. but should he have felt much more after that. it was a min or less that the dr. waited before he started to lance the infected area. it was a very small incision that he made. no bigger than the tip of a penile finger. i'm not sure if the doctor is correct. it's been about a week since the staph. i've had the st. for about a month now. it is now about a year since the infection. i am not sure how long it took to heal. i was told it would take about a day or two for it to heal again.
Answer: hi try this link it may help you. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do
Expected Response: most helpful answer a staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced. i have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as i am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved. just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use. many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them. in order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected in the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus. this can be very difficult. sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is less painful that trying to numb up this challenging area. hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now. if the staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again.

Question: am i more vulnerable to "catching" a cancer if i currently have the flu. i am also at a higher risk for getting a flu shot if i have been exposed to a flu virus.
Answer: you are not alone. many people are more vulnerable than others to getting a virus from a flu vaccine. if you are a person with a weakened immune system it is important to get vaccinated against the flu virus as soon as possible. if the flu vaccine is not available you will need to see your doctor. if your immune system is not working well you may need to have a second shot.

Question: is there a test to tell if mono is gone? . my son is 17 and has mono. he was sick for a couple of week before it was determined that he had mono. no it has been 4 weeks and he is feeling great. is there a way to tell if he still has mono or can he go back to full daily activities.
Answer: hi if you have mono you could be mono or mono can be a side effect from mono. if you are having a mono test you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: that will be up to his medical provider to decide. while there are blood tests (ebv panel and liver function tests) that can determine the current status of this pesky viral infection a hands-on examination may be necessary to know if he is now good-to-go. since some "daily activities" may include contact or collision sports (like football) it is best to get the patient-specific okay from his doctor or health care professional. the fact that he is feeling great is the best news of course so the mono may have completely resolved by this four week mark.

Answer: there is a lot of soap that can be used for vaginal cleansing. it is called a "mild soap" so you will need to use a lot to clean the vagina. the best soap is a mild soap and that is a good soap. it will not cure the problem.
Expected Response: any soap that you use for your face you can use for your genital area. rinsing with fresh water is always advised. the vagina has a natural lubricant so it should not be the soap that is responsible for any dryness. check with your medical provider if this is an ongoing issue.

Question: how can i tell if i’m sleep deprived?
Answer: you can tell if you are sleep deprived by looking at the number of hours of sleep you have. if you have a sleep-deprived person you may notice that you have more sleep than you think you have because of the fact that you are sleeping more than you thought you did. this is called a “wake up” effect. it may also be called a 'wake up syndrome ” because the brain is able to wake up from sleep deprivation. if your sleep-suppressed person is a woman or a man or has a family history of sleep disorders then you may be able to tell if your sleeping patterns are normal. if it's a man you may not be able tell if his sleep pattern is normal because he is sleeping more often than you do. if sleep deprivation is a family member you may have a more severe sleep-disordered family member syndrome. if the person is not a woman and has
Expected Response: if you fall asleep before your head hits the pillow that’s not a good sign. that means you’re sleep deprived okay. if you fall asleep in less than 5 minutes on a regular basis you probably need more sleep. if you fall asleep while driving that’s a big danger zone factor a big red flag that you’re going to want to understand a little bit more about. driving a car and operating a vehicle and while it may seem very rote and may seem very easy to do if you notice yourself moving over lanes not being able to stay in the lane as you normally would that’s going to be a definite sign of sleep deprivation. if you’re not thinking as clearly you’re not making the decisions that you would normally make as quickly that’s going to be a sign of sleep deprivation. and just overall movement your reaction time slows down with sleep deprivation your cognition time slows down. believe it or not even your creativity slows down with sleep deprivation. so if you’re at work and you’re trying to answer to a big problem or trying to understand what’s going on and you’re just not clicking you’re not finding the words you’re not doing the right thing or what you would normally do it could be a sign of sleep deprivation.

Question: i really need help. im scared and worried. please just read my additional infro and help. 14 year old girl. ive reached 200 pounds. i cried. im fairly certain i eat proper amount of food the right kind parent think its lack of exercise i have little to none. im 5'5. i know i need to exercise now i tried when i was 170's i skipped almost 1 000 times every day in 7th grade. nothing. it did nothing. i didnt lose anything. im ashamed of myself. need help. anythingexercises protein drinks for teens other healthy foods? i need advice. scared for my health. need this to stop i want to be healthy. i dont want to have to live like this. i want help.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's hard to let go of the feeling of helplessness that comes with having to live this way. it sounds like you're trying to get pregnant. you may be
Expected Response: i'm not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this? my friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds. i was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight. the first thing i did was not allow her to make her own plate. she thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate. a sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein (1 sausage) and a glass of orange juice. or since you're young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal that's healthy and without all that sugar. an ex could be kashi or something like raisin bran. the second thing i did was teach her about nutrition. her mom is 300+ pounds so i knew there was no one there who knew either. if you ball your hand into a fist that's the size of your stomach. that's how much food can actually fit. anymore than that then you're stretching your stomach out. the more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size it's supposed to be. third which should probably be first but i wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise. you have to exercise. skipping at school or pe isn't enough. i walked with her everyday for 30 minutes. she didn't think she could do it but i stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her. we were even able to start doing it twice a day. hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging. fourth you have to drink tons of water. sometimes your body might feel like it's hungry when you're actually thirsty. a good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day. to help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cups/glasses and that's how you can keep track. fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods. i made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal. her snacks were fruit. also a good time to say eat 5-7 small meals everyday and when i say small i mean the size of your fist small.

Answer: hi you should try and get a test done for herpes. you can do this at your doctors clinic. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i wouldn't ask the general public for an opinion on this matter but there are two paths: 1. stay with her in aspiration you become married in which then you would be susceptible to herpes and have the risk your child may become infected. 2. leave and play life a couple more rounds. in my personal opinion it seems pretty obvious for the second option but it is your choice.

Expected Response: the real question is what type of back pain are you having? is it constant or intermittent? if it comes and goes you may be having contractions and should contact your physician. if it is constant then it most likely is related to nerve impingement related to the pregnancy. exercise is a very good idea. you may want to take a warm bath keeping the water temperature less than 104 degrees preferably around 100. this may be relieving. depending on what the pain is your physician can possibly provide you with ideas on how to better handle the problem. there are different exercises alternative type of therapies and there are safe medications that can be used to help as well.

Expected Response: as you're drinking your morning cup of joe you're probably just waiting for that wonderful rush of energy and alertness you've come to know and enjoy. within 15 minutes of gulping your caffeine your adrenalin rises increasing your heart and breathing rates your stomach starts to produce more acids and your urinary output rises (as anyone with a small bladder knows! ). but i bet you didn't know that caffeine tweeks your adrenal glands to produce more cortisol (stress hormone) which then stimulates the release of the liver's stored sugars. any endurance athlete knows this and uses it to their advantage. you drink your caffeine and then use the newly circulating sugar fuel to power through another workout. but what if you're sitting at your desk sipping your coffee with nowhere to go? then you might have problems because when the sugar levels rise with caffeine so do insulin levels which when they finally plummet after handling the circulating sugar leave a rip roaring appetite for more sugar in their wake. for runners and bikers this makes sense since you've just burned a zillion calories and need to replenish the sugar stores. not so for someone in an office cubicle with nowhere to go. here are some suggestions. to kill carb cravings associated with caffeine ingestion make certain to eat a combo of protein and fiber. how about peanut or almond butter on a multigrain cracker? or have that caffeine with a yogurt and blueberries or eggs and veggies. you get the point. when you're downing lots of coffee with nothing in your stomach you're more likely to reach for sugary foods so watch out. or you can just drink beverages with less caffeine in them: 6 ounces brewed coffee 105 mg caffeine; 6 ounces instant coffee 55 mg; 12 ounces colas 35-45 mg; 6 ounces tea 35 mg. now remember when you go to one of your fancy schmancy coffee houses you'll often be purchasing at least 8 ounces of coffee and closer to 12 ounces so you're really consuming over 200 mg of caffeine. all the more reason to be cautious if you just happen to be one of those people who is affected by the sugar rush.

Question: what's the difference between "situational depression" and depression that's not situational?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's hard to say what's going on in your life when you're dealing with depression. it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress. you may be feeling a lot more stress when you have depression but it's not the same as being depressed. it can be a bit overwhelming and a little scary. it also can be difficult to get help because you have a lot to worry about. i would suggest you get some help from a counselor or therapist. they can help you sort out what's causing your depression and help you get over it. it may take a few sessions to get over your depression but you'll find it's worth it.
Expected Response: depression is depression defined by a series of symptoms that involve changes in sleep energy concentration appetite etc. one does not need to have a reason to develop a depression though if there is a particular event that may have precipitated it (e. g. a loss a separation) that may be relevant to the psychotherapy and understanding one's vulnerabilities to depression. not everybody who has a loss or stressful event occur develops a depression so the thinking is that someone either is or isn't biologically vulnerable to developing depression. depression is different from normal grief or sadness. grief or sadness related to an event does not involve disruptions of sleep and appetite or thoughts of suicide. in fact normal grief can become complicated by a depression which in turn can interfere with the resolution of the grief; so in other words depression is a syndrome involving many components and whatever causes it (we don't really know) it should get treated. when the syndrome involves strong physical symptoms (sleep energy concentration not functioning thoughts of suicide) medicines are especially likely to be helpful.

Question: my implanon is expired by 3 months having irregular bleeding and sore breast. can i become pregnant if its expired? . i have had my implanon in for 3 years (sept. 26th it was placed). i have not been able to get it removed but my insurance kicks in the first of the year. i have had sore breast some nausea and i've had my period 3 times in less then 2 months. they have not been regular ones tho. i have taken a pregnancy test but was negative. is there a good chance of getting pregnant while the implanon is still in place but passed the 3 year mark?
Answer: hi if your having a period its not the time to get a test done its the time for a test to show the pregnancy. if your pregnant its best to wait till your next period comes along then get a blood test done there is no way you can get pregnant from this. good luck
Expected Response: yes you can get pregnant. that is why the implanon has an expiration date. the point where the hormone has depleted. this may be why your period is not normal. use a secondary form of birth control (like a condom) or you will be just taking chances.

Question: i am employed full time and contribute toward my health care insurance. . what will be the incentive for employers already providing very good health care coverage to maintain the plans they have? it seems to me that this opens that door for everyone to have access to coverage whether they go to work every day or not but for those who do get out of bed every day to go to work (and have had good insurance coverage until now) will most likely get their plans downgraded to be more in line with what everyone will qualify for. what will be my incentive to keep working when my unemployed neighbor gets the same insurance i do for staying home?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a tough time for people who are unemployed. you and your employer are responsible for paying for your health insurance. you should be able to shop for a plan through your state's marketplace. if you don't have insurance you can shop for another plan through the marketplace. you can find out what plans
Expected Response: employers have plenty of incentive to offer health insurance. for one it's a very important tool for attracting top-notch employees a fact the law isn't likely to change. second employers reap significant tax benefits by offering employees health insurance. in addition the health reform law requires employers to continue offering coverage or pay fines for failing to do so. and any changes employers make to their plans will have more to do with controlling costs than anything else -- a trend that's been in place long before the affordable care act became law.

Question: does 2 or 2 1/2 glasses of wine a day caues high blood preasure?
Answer: hi just google this link from the uk’s nhs your find lots of info on this link. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. a moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men (under 65 years old) and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old. a serving is considered: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits so the answer to your question depends on if you’re male or female how old you are and whether you’re having an appropriate serving size. if you’re already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isn’t to suggest that you start drinking if you don’t already. the potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too. this would be an area to discuss further with your doctor. drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems. keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension. it’s typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you don’t already and it’s important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol.

Question: how can i convince a reluctant child to get a flu shot?
Answer: if you are able to convince a child that you have the flu you can convince them to take the shot. if you do not have the vaccine you can tell them that you do have the shot if they are not able to tell you. if the child is able to talk about the flu with you you talk about their ability to talk. if they do not want to talk talk to you talk to them. if your child is a little over two months old and has a fever it is not likely that they will get the flu. if it is a fever you can talk about it with them.
Expected Response: why [not] flumist? it is an equally effective (some studies say "more effective") flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose. no needles. when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things: 1. i give them choices. they can have one shot (assuming they only need one) or two! 2. i can give them a "booster" instead of a shot. (it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful! ) 3. they can get it in their arm or leg where it doesn't hurt very much or their eye! (of course we don't do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice. 4. i tell them this: "i am not supposed to do this but if you don't tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle. the one we use for infants instead of the big-person needle. how about that? " 5. and finally. "if this little "booster" hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately! " (of course she is going to do that anyway. ) the games we play.

Question: what does ventral fat hernias and enlarged spleen have to do with drinking a few alcoholica drinks. ive never heard of sudafed or sudabened. i am not sure what the cause of the enlarged spasm is. i have had my spleen removed and it is still there. i had a tubal ligation and i am now 40 years old. i was told that i was pregnant. is there any way i can get rid of it?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. sudacinated spasms can be life threatening. but if you're still having this problem you need to see a medical provider. many women are not aware of the fact that they are having a tubular ligation. it's important to note that sudapenoids are not cancerous. they are just a side effect of a hormone called prolactin. in other words they are harmless. if you have a tub

Question: what's best of day to check your blood pressure. my pressure changes all the time when i check it at different times. i'm 74 and a active person. thomas is my doctor.
Answer: hi i think your find that if you look at your blood sugar its a good thing to do. good luck
Expected Response: keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day. exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards. stress can influence blood pressure too. in fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldn’t be elevated otherwise. make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible. for these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people. also because your blood pressure can vary it’s important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern. the best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel. the accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device. some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too. to determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device. it is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day. the most important reading would then be the average reading so just take your bp a few times a day and write it down. as long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important. my moms blood pressure is 56 over 40 what

Question: what are the symptoms of crohn's disease?
Answer: symptoms of the disease may include: nausea vomiting diarrhea vomiting diarrhea severe pain in the stomach.
Expected Response: common symptoms of crohn's disease include abdominal pain diarrhea and weight loss. less common symptoms include poor appetite fever night sweats rectal pain and rectal bleeding. the symptoms of crohn's disease are dependent on the location the extent and the severity of the inflammation. the different subtypes of crohn's disease and their symptoms are: crohn's colitis is inflammation that is confined to the colon. abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are the common symptoms. anal fistulae and peri-rectal abscesses also can occur. crohn's enteritis refers to inflammation confined to the small intestine (the first part called the jejunum or the second part called the ileum). involvement of the ileum alone is referred to as crohn's ileitis. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. obstruction of the small intestine also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis is inflammation that affects only the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum) the part of the small intestine closest to the colon. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's enterocolitis and ileocolitis are terms to describe inflammation that involve both the small intestine and the colon. bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis and ileo-colitis are the most common types of crohn's disease. (ulcerative colitis frequently involves only the rectum or rectum and sigmoid colon at the distal end of the colon. these are called ulcerative proctitis and procto-sigmoiditis respectively). up to one-third of patients with crohn's disease may have one or more of the following conditions involving the anal area: swelling of the tissue of the anal sphincter the muscle at the end of the colon that controls defecation. development of ulcers and fissures (long ulcers) within the anal sphincter. these ulcers and fissures can cause bleeding and pain with defecation. development of anal fistulae (abnormal tunnels) between the anus or rectum and the skin surrounding the anus). mucous and pus may drain from the openings of the fistulae on the skin. development of perirectal abscesses (collections of pus in the anal and rectal area). perirectal abscesses can cause fever pain and tenderness around the anus.

Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. bartho-related cysts are not uncommon. in fact the term "bartholin" is not used in the medical field to refer to a cyst (barthol) but rather a fluid-filled cyst that is not associated with a cystic disease. a barstol is a fluid that is produced by the cystic fibrosis (fib) virus. it is also called a "barcode cyst" because it is a cytopl

Answer: hi if you think you have been on birthcontrol for 3 months then you should be ok you could be pregnant then you could try taking a pill or you could just get pregnant. but it would take a lot of work and lots of luck. good luck

Question: how is having a $3000 health care deductible better? . since the aca i now have a $3000 deductible for medical care and $1500 deductible for prescriptions. in effect i pay $200 a month for insurance that does not pay for anything. i will not meet those deductibles within 12 months unless something catastrophic happens (and i cant afford that). i fail to see how this is improving health care in america. all it has done is ensure people go to the doctor less frequently even if they need care and and that they don't get the medications they need. i am not a doctor and i do not have insurance.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're struggling with a lot of things. you need to see your health care provider so that you can be properly assessed and have a plan that meets your needs. you'll also need to make sure you're covered by your primary health insurance plan. you can find a plan by searching for
Expected Response: many people have expressed frustration as you have about the cost of health insurance -- in particular the out-of-pocket costs that come with many health plans. insurers are now required to accept everyone who applies (before the law they frequently refused to sell coverage to people with any type of pre-existing medical condition). in response they have looked for other ways to reduce costs. shifting costs of care to consumers is one way to do that. the plans do provide access to many preventive services without you having to pay anything at the time of the visit. so it's important to take advantage of that -- wellness visits vaccinations many cancer screenings etc. depending on your health condition you may able to get most of the care you need each year at no additional cost. and you mentioned a catastrophic situation which is what insurance is intended to protect against in the first place. under the law your costs are capped at $6 600 for 2015. that's a lot of money but if you were in an accident or got very sick it's a lot lower than it would be if you had no coverage or even a private insurance policy before the law took effect. still i understand your frustration. no doubt there are trade offs. everyone is now guaranteed coverage but healthcare remains very pricey for most people. you might want to revisit the marketplace during open enrollment -- november 15 - february 15 -- to see if you can find yourself a better deal.

Question: my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. you need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. i hope you're feeling better soon!
Expected Response: first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book.
================================================================================
Question: gastroenteritis ive had it for over a month should i be conserned? but i haven't been vomiting or naushous. the only thing i still have is that my stomach feels all crampy and when i eat i feel full and feel like vomiting but i dont feel any pain. i have been having this for over 2 months and i dont know if i should be worried or not.

Question: what are the odds of having a partial hysterectomy and then getting pregnant? . this situation was presented to me by a friend 40 year old woman hx of partial hysterectomy suddenly finds out she is 12 to 16 weeks pregnant but never knew. states there is a heartbeat and its a girl. next day she goes to the dr and finds out she lost the baby. there were no previous complaints of pain and or bleeding. how likely do you think this story is?
Answer: hi just google hystrectomy its a bit hard to find the answer but it would be best to see your doctor and get the answer from him or her. good luck
Expected Response: it depends on what she considers a "partial" hysterectomy. if she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero. based on the detail of this story i would seriously doubt its validity.

Question: when is ringworm no longer contagious when swimming in a chlorinated pool? do waterproof bandaids prevent the spread?
Answer: ringworm is not contagious when you swim in a chlorine-free pool. however if you are in a pool that has a chlorine pool you may be exposed to ringworm. if you have ringworm in your hands you should wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. if your hands are dry you may have a mild case of ringworm but you should not have ringworms in your mouth.
Expected Response: you will not spead ringworm (a fungal infection) through a swimming pool. while it can be spread through direct contact with others who may be susceptible just cover it with that waterproof bandaid so you don't have to explain it. hopefully you are treating it so it should be resolving in a few weeks to a month.
================================================================================
Question: if i'm a smoker under the affordable care act will i have to pay more for health insurance?
Answer: the law will not affect anyone who has health insurance through their state's marketplace. if you have health insurance at work you will not be penalized for not having insurance at home.
Expected Response: the affordable care act does allow insurers to charge smokers a 50% surcharge because of their tobacco use. that can amount to a large increase -- potentially thousands of dollars -- in the cost of health insurance for smokers. and the tax credits available to help lower the cost of insurance premiums cannot be applied to offset the smoking penalty. however insurers do have flexibility in how this surcharge is applied and some states have banned the practice meaning insurers selling in vermont and washington dc for example won't be allowed to charge smokers more for their insurance plan (you can check with your state's department of insurance to learn the law where you live). in addition the law does require insurers to cover treatments that help smokers quit. most employers make smoking cessation programs available as well. and under the law's regulations insurers will not be allowed to charge you the full surcharge if you enroll in a smoking cessation program.
================================================================================
Question: what surgery options do i have for parkinsons disease?
Answer: there are a number of options available for parkinson's disease. the most common type of parkinson’s disease is parkinsonism (not related to parkinson disease). the symptoms of parkinism are similar to those of parkinsonia but the symptoms are different. the symptoms usually start as a mild headache and gradually increase in intensity as you get older. the pain and stiffness of parkar fasciitis can be severe and can last for several days. the cause of parkisone disease is unknown. parkinson may be caused by a genetic predisposition to parkarfasciosis. the disease is not caused by parkinson but is caused by an inherited disease that causes the disease. if you have a genetic susceptibility to parkinitis you may have an increased risk of developing parkinson. if your doctor suspects an increased chance of developing the disease he or she may order a blood test to check
Expected Response: brain surgery may be considered when drugs fails to control symptoms of parkinson's disease or cause severe or disabling side effects. deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) is a technique for treating parkinson's disease. it affects movement by using electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. the electrical impulses are generated by wire electrodes surgically placed in the brain. deep brain stimulation may be used in addition to therapy with levodopa or other drugs when drugs alone do not control symptoms adequately. this technique is the preferred surgical method of treating most cases of advanced parkinson's disease. it does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than older more destructive surgical methods such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy. 6 deep brain stimulation (dbs) neither cures parkinson's disease nor eliminates the need for medicine. dbs of the thalamus is done to treat disabling tremor caused by parkinson's disease. procedures that stimulate the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus control a wider range of symptoms (in addition to tremor) and are used more often than stimulation of the thalamus. pallidotomy and thalamotomy are rarely done anymore. they involve the precise destruction of very small areas in the deep part of the brain that cause symptoms. neurotransplantation surgery is an experimental procedure being studied for the treatment of parkinson's disease. it involves implanting cells that produce dopamine into the brain. information about the effectiveness of neurotransplantation is limited and it is not a proven treatment or a realistic option for most people at this time. surgery choices deep brain stimulation pallidotomy thalamotomy neurotransplantation what to think about a neurologist with special training in parkinson's disease is most often the best kind of doctor to make a decision about surgery. if you might benefit from surgery or deep brain stimulation your neurologist can refer you to a brain surgeon with experience doing these operations. surgery most often becomes a treatment option for people when parkinson's disease progresses to the point that drugs can no longer control symptoms adequately. with advanced disease existing symptoms may get worse or a person may develop new symptoms that drugs cannot control. (however when a person has severe one-sided tremor deep brain stimulation [dbs] may be considered much sooner because this symptom often responds better to dbs than to medicine. ) people who have extremely advanced parkinson's or who have other serious conditions (such as heart or lung disease cancer or kidney failure ) are not usually good candidates for surgery. surgery is usually not considered for people who have dementia or psychiatric disorders. surgery is not a cure for parkinson's disease. drugs are usually still necessary after surgery but surgery can reduce the number and amount of drugs needed to control symptoms. this reduces the side effects caused by drugs while at the same time controlling symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: our son started eating rice cereal at 5 months and veggies/fruit at 6 months. he refuses the solids. any suggestions?
Answer: you may have a problem with your son's appetite. he may be hungry because he has a craving for food. he might be hungry for something he has not eaten. he is also hungry for food because he is hungry for his own body. he does not want to eat his own food.
Expected Response: you are not experiencing an unusual challenge. many babies at this age go through refusal. be patient maybe give him a break for a couple of days and then try it again. which fruits/veggies have you offered so far and are you making/buying them? the good news is that at this age the majority of calories will come from your baby's milk source (breastmilk/formula). your baby needs a minimum of 4 tablespoons of iron-fortified cereal in order to get enough iron to prevent the onset of anemia. when you reintroduce solids i would try to establish the rice or oatmeal cereal.

Expected Response: drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel "blood thinners" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval.

Question: what does gallbladder failure spots on liver hypothyroidism and blood loss mean?
Answer: gallbladders are not considered a cause of liver failure. they are considered a symptom of a medical condition called gallstones.

Question: can i break the same bone twice. i broke my 3rd metacarpal 10 months ago. this past weekend while doing some work outside my hand started hurting. there was no trauma that i can remember. it has swelled up and is pretty painful. antiinflamitories dont seem to be helping. is it possible i broke it again?
Answer: no. you have not broken a bone twice in 10 years.
Expected Response: it would typically require a significant injury again to fracture your metacarpal but the only way you will know for sure it to be examined by your medical provider and perhaps have another x-ray. bones tend to heal well if the fractures were properly lined up but bones can re-break.

Question: is itching similar to a yeast infection a symptom of uti or bladder infections? . i have had this issue for about a month. went in for annual examine and doctor said everything looked fine. however the itch continues heaviness/bloated feeling some leaking when i exercise or sneeze no fever or pain but feel sluggish. i am wondering about bladder infection or uti but i have never had either of these so don't know. i am not sexually active and am 45 years old and still getting normal periods.
Answer: hi if your having uti then yes you need to see your doctor for a test for it and see what they say. good luck
Expected Response: i have had both infections and only had itching with the yeast infection. any discharge? uti's or bladder infections feel more of an urgency to urinate and then you go and its just a few dribbles that causes discomfort. however maybe its in the hair lice etc. it will live in all hair and on surfaces. i'd have this checked out again and if your doctor still says everything is fine ask what you can do to alleviate the symptoms. good luck that feeling is awful as most women know at one time or another!

Question: is metformin used for anything other than treating of diabetes?
Answer: metformins are not used for treating diabetes. they are not recommended for use in children under the age of 6.
Expected Response: metformin is a commonly used medication for diabetes. in addition to helping manage type 2 diabetes it may be used to treat gestational diabetes or diabetes that arises during pregnancy. it has also been used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) a condition in which a woman’s hormones are out of balance.

Question: is tylenol safe to use for “flu” symptoms caused by interferon for hepatitis c treatment? is motrin safer?
Answer: motrin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it is also known as a proton pump inhibitor.
Expected Response: tylenol (acetaminophen) is toxic to the liver in large doses (such as in suicidal attempts where a patient ingests large amounts often more than 10 grams of the medication) and also in situations where a patient drinks alcohol heavily while taking high doses of tylenol. tylenol with alcohol ingestion can be toxic to the liver with lower doses of tylenol than without the alcohol. otherwise for the general population both tylenol and motrin (ibuprofen an nsaids) have low (1%) liver toxicity at the regular recommended doses. moreover both drugs can usually be used in the recommended doses prescribed by a physician reasonably safely for the "flu" symptoms caused by interferon used for treating chronic hepatitis c. with advanced complicated cirrhosis from hepatitis c for which interferon is rarely used all drugs including these must be prescribed with great caution if at all. in addition in these patients with advanced cirrhosis nsaids including motrin can worsen or even precipitate hepatorenal syndrome (a serious condition with both liver and kidney failure) and possibly cause intestinal bleeding.

Question: how long after treatment of a yeast infection(diflucan) should symptoms dissappear? . i have a yeast and it is very painful to touch. i am very concerned that the yeast infection could have been caused by my diflucerin.
Answer: hi ok good luck
Expected Response: diffucan is not a "100% guaranteed" cure so there can be treatment failure. also each person (and each yeast infection) will respond individually so it would be impossible to know how you will respond versus someone else. as a rule most women improve in a few days to a week but again there is no way to conclusively predict an individual response.

Question: since i had brain surgery before is it bad for my health if my boyfriend pulls my hair roughly? . it's been 12 years since i had brain surgery as a child. all i remember is that until my hair grew back i had a scar on the back of head where they had removed a piece of my skull during the surgery. now my boyfriend grabbed all of my hair and pulled it while kissing me which i loved. but afterwards i noticed something didn't feel right in that area in the back of my head for the next couple of days. is it possible that my previous brain surgery makes hair pulling actually unhealthy?
Answer: hi if you have a problem with your hair pulling then you should go see your doctor or gyno to get the answers. good luck
Expected Response: your scalp is really not connected to your brain but your scalp is rich in sensory nerves so forceful hair-pulling may result in some residual discomfort as you have experienced. brain surgery 12 years ago should not preclude playful hair-pulling but if this act causes you pain afterwards it should be avoided no matter how much you loved it.
================================================================================
Question: do you recommend genetic testing for a child with epilepsy?
Answer: yes. genetic testing can help identify a child's epilepsy in a variety of ways. it can identify a genetic disorder in which the child has a genetic defect that is not related to epilepsy. it may also help identify an epilepsy in which a person has a mutation that is genetic in origin. it is important to make sure that you are getting the correct diagnosis for your child's disorder.
Expected Response: epilepsy is a disorder that is primarily diagnosed by history (the character of the episodes) and complemented by the results of other tests such as an mri and eeg. in over half of the cases no cause of the epilepsy is found. for most patients genetic testing is not helpful. there are rare cases of epilepsy where the cause is identified through genetic testing but it is not recommended for the great majority of individuals with epilepsy.

Question: as a man should i tell new partners i may have been exposed to hpv? even though i can not test to be certain? . i have been having unprotected sex with a girl who was recently told she has hpv for about two months. she went back after diagnoses and the gyno told her a bump he found may be a wart. i have never shown any symptoms or warts of any kind so do i definitely have it? am i obligated to tell new partners even though there is no hard proof i have hpv? also if i keep sleeping with her will her infection stay longer as in will we pass it back and forth?
Answer: hi yes you can have a hpv infection and still have it but not as you think it is. if you have a wart then you may have hpvar if you do have a warts and you have sex with her then you have the virus. but if you get a wart you have to have it for a while then
Expected Response: hi so have you ever been tested? if not then you should. and yes you should always be upfront about anything you have when it comes to having sex this way it does give the other person either male or female the choice to say no. good luck
================================================================================
Question: some drugs' costs have gone through the roof. is this from the new health care? will it affect later on?
Answer: there are many factors that can cause the cost of prescription drugs to go up. first the cost to the doctor. prescription drugs are usually prescribed by the doctor for the same reason as a prescription drug. a doctor may prescribe a drug for a different reason. some drugs may be more expensive than others. second the doctor may have to pay for additional medications. this may be because the doctor is not able to pay more for the medication he or she is prescribed. third the cost for other medications. drugs that are used for other medical purposes may be cheaper than drugs that the doctor prescribes. this can be due to the fact that the drug is more expensive or because the drug may be used for a longer period of time. the cost may also be due because the medication is more likely to cause side effects. drugs are expensive because they are made by a different type
Expected Response: regarding the question about drug costs in actuality 80% of prescription drugs sold in this country are generic -- and prices of drugs haven't risen greatly in the past few years. what has increased however is the portion many of us have to pay toward the cost of our drugs which is likely what you're experiencing. that's not a function of obamacare but rather a funtion of employers (assuming you get insurance at work) and insurers shifting more costs onto consumers as a way of getting control over their own costs. unfortunately that's a trend that's likely to continue.

Question: my husband only coughs and spits mucus during the smoking period. is it the beginning of copd? or is he having from long.
Answer: hi as you have been smoking for 3 days and have not had any symptoms of a cold you will need to get on with your life. good luck
Expected Response: long-term smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). if the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of copd. i'd suggest your husband see a doctor about this. the coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking. he will only find out by having a physical exam. keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs. smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body. quitting smoking is always the best option but i realize it can very difficult for some people to do. and some people simply don't want to quit smoking. i hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing. i wish you all the best!

Question: how is it possiable to have caught chlamydia if i tested negative a year ago and have not had sex since before then? . i went to my annual pap and this year i tested positive and last year i didn't. i have not slept with anyone this whole year and actually it has been longer than a year. is there anyway the test can be wrong o that my test was wrong last year?
Answer: hi if you have chlamydialydia you should be ok. but if you test positive for it then you should have tested negative for it. good luck
Expected Response: hi managed to find this bit of info may help you. chlamydia can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes and often women don't find out until they try to start a family and don't fall pregnant. it can also cause pelvic inflammatory disease which is painful and can also scar your fallopian tubes leaving you infertile permanently. it seems it can stay hidden do hope this helps in some way. good luck

Question: why doesn't my 11-month-old have teeth yet?
Answer: teeth are really hard to chew and there are several different types of teeth. a child's teeth are the most common type of teeth that are found in children. the most important type of tooth is the denture. there are three types of dentures: the simple type (the toothbrush) the hard type and the hard-sided type. the hard toothbrush is a big part of the child's diet and can be a very helpful tool for keeping teeth healthy. the soft toothbrush can be used for a variety of dental conditions. the dental hygiene tool is a tool that is used to clean teeth and prevent tooth decay. the toothbrush also can be useful in keeping teeth clean. the dentist can also be used to remove plaque and plaque can be easily removed. if you have questions about dental hygiene and the tooth brushing you should talk to your dentist.
Expected Response: generally we wait until 14 months for the first tooth eruption. after 14 months i would recommend consulting with a reputable pediatric dentist.

Question: if you miss your period how long after will it show positive on test if you r pregnant? how long should u wait to take1. i had a 3day period last month plus it was late. this month i haven't had 1 at all! i am supposed to start my period the 2nd week of the month and i took a pregnancy test and it says negative. i just wanted some advice if i am taking the test to early or if it could be something else because i have had this problem once before but never have had a period only last 3days. i am bloated like and have a lot of discharge. i have took over 8 test within the last month. any advice or help please?
Answer: hi if you have missed your period then yes it could show positive. but if you miss a period then you should go to your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: no i don't think that your pregnant. i say this because of all the negative test feedback. however i do think that you should see a doctor if you are having such heavy discharge. you could have a number of things going on such as a yeast infection ( which you could try over the counter testing for to determ if that's possibly what it is. they also sell treatment for yeast infections as well. ) you could also have some type of std ( i know that's not what you want to hear. ) i know its not a 100% answer but better to be safe than sorry. if you don't have insurance you can try the free clinic most county's have them. depending on your income you only have to pay a minimum fee or in most cases nothing at all.

Question: how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.
Answer: hi if your broken foot has been broken it could be a sign of arthritis but if you have had a broken toe for a long time then you need to see your doctor and get a blood test done there could be some kind of arthritis in the foot or you could be getting a broken bone in the toe. but if your still having this problem just go see your dr and get tested for arthritis. good luck
Expected Response: hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically "osteoarthritis" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the "wear and tear" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define "arthritis" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed. i am type 2 diabetic so that could have something to do with it. get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life.

Question: i have a cut on the corner of my mouth that wont heal. what can i use to help?
Answer: a cut may be a sign of a bacterial infection but if you have a sinus infection you may need to see your medical provider. a cut can also be a symptom of a sinorectomy. if you are not sure what your symptoms are you can call your primary care provider or a dentist.
Expected Response: if you're referring to a crack in the corner of your mouth where the upper and lower lips join you may be suffering from perleche known medically as angular cheilitis. perleche can be caused by a fungal infection in which case you'll need to see a doctor for medication to help it heal. the condition also can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin b so you can try taking a vitamin supplement (assuming you're not allergic to any medications or food colorings) or eating more green leafy vegetables which typically contain plenty of different b vitamins. because of the possibility this is a fungal infection i'd suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider for an evaluation. i wish you all the best!

Question: is there another medication besides prednisone that will take down inflammation caused by a severe case of vasculitis. doctors have recently diagnosed this condition in my mother's lower stomach area. prednisone treatment (40mg) after 16 days has done nothing to ease the severe pain or nausea especially after eating. actually the symptoms are getting worse and it seems she is giving up after a 1 year fight with this. is there another medication she can be put on to take away the inflammation so she can have a stint put in? please help me as i believe time is running out.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's very important for you to get this checked out. the medications you're taking may not be working for you. the best thing you can do is talk to your doctor about it. he or she may have a referral to a different medication for you (like prednisolone) or may have another medication that is compatible with your condition

Question: had a period in april spotted may no period june and nothing for july yet. took a hpt 2wks ago negative. pregnant? . had sex recently gained weight during this time and very bad stomach ache 1 day for the last two months. had cramping with no period. no period on july and july.
Answer: hi if you have a period then you need to get it checked out. but you do need to take a test to see if your pregnant or not. good luck
Expected Response: a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell.

Question: are there any specific diets for acid reflux?
Answer: there are a variety of dietary guidelines for acid-deficiency. some are specific to acid refractory conditions such as those associated with acid refusals. other guidelines are based on the type of acid refractor and the severity of the refracture. the most common guidelines are the following: a diet low in saturated fat: low in fat. high in fiber. high-fiber foods such as fruit vegetables whole grains and dairy products. low in sodium. low-fibre foods such such as breads and cereals. low fiber foods such like beans and rice. low fat foods such breads cereal and pasta. low sugar. low protein. low sodium. high fiber foods like breads cereals and pasta
Expected Response: these are the foods that irritate a damaged esophageal lining and should be limited or eaten in small portions: citrus fruits and juices. tomato products. chili peppers. pepper. spicy food. it's important when you are in an emotional state to try and eat balanced meals and snacks and keep yourself as well nourished as possible because not eating can make matters worse emotionally and physically.

Question: i'm not sure if i have a pilonadil cyst i have two holes above my anus but i have no pain or leakage. i have been on it for about a year now and i have not had any problems. i am not sure what i am doing wrong.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a cyst. it's very common in women. it can be very painful. the best thing you can do is see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you can also try taking a home anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. this will help relieve some of the pain. if you have any questions about cysts or other conditions you should talk to your primary care provider. he or she can help you get the best care for you. wishing you all the best!
Expected Response: these could be pilonidal sinus tracts (or openings) based on your description. these areas are capable of forming cysts or infections (abscesses) but as long as you are not having any problems just leave them alone. if you are a male make sure to keep hair from these areas.

Question: is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.
Answer: yes it could be a yeast infection. if you have a yeast it can be a sign that you are getting a yeast-like infection. it could also be a fungal infection.
Expected Response: no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.

Question: i take sulfamethoxazole-tmp for bronchitis does that mean it can be contagious?
Answer: yes. sulfametyltramine-tmp is a very effective cough suppressant.
Expected Response: bronchitis is not contagious (you cannot transmit bronchitis to someone else) but the pathogens (viruses bacteria fungus) etc. that are capable of causing bronchitis can be transmitted to others but exposure to these pathogens does not mean that the exposed person will contract bronchitis. they may only get a simple cold. or nothing at all. you are on an antibiotic that may or may not help bronchitis since it is just a clinical guess that the cause is bacterial.

Question: should i have a follow up on my foot? . i walked into my childs toy last friday. i hit it on the left middle of my foot. it instantly swelled up. i went to the er later that night. they took x-rays said there was not anything wrong. well now 5 days later all of my toes are bruised and above my toes. if i hit the side of my foot it hurts and if i walk on it too much it hurts. its still hard to bend my toes and i really don't understand what my toes have to do with that part of my foot. should i go back to the doctor?
Answer: it sounds like you have a foot infection. it is not uncommon for people to have a "foot infection" at any time. i would suggest you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: yes. go back to your doctor to have your foot checked. he or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong. your foot has 26 bones. there are 5 long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot. each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes. tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones. any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons. bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes. possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first x-ray. this is not unusual. your doctor will decide whether further x-rays or other testing is needed.

Question: i have or think i have colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent when should i contact my doctor?
Answer: most helpful answer colorex is very rare. however in most cases it is not uncommon to have a coloreum or metastatic colon cancer. the most common cause of coloregia is a benign tumor that can grow in the colon. however the most serious cause of colon cancer is an enlarged prostate gland. the prostate gland is located in the middle of the abdomen and is the most important organ for the production of urine. the gland is also called the "muscle" and is responsible for producing energy and oxygen. the muscle is the part of the body that controls the flow of urine and the prostate is the place where urine is collected. the muscles are located at the top of the lower abdomen and are located below the navel. the muscular muscles are the most prominent and are responsible for the flow and distribution of urine from the abdomen to the anus. the
Expected Response: some people who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer do not have any symptoms. sometimes it is discovered before symptoms appear either on a chest x-ray or as part of lab tests. you may be seeing a doctor regularly to check for symptoms but symptoms might start between visits. be aware of what is normal for you and tell your doctor about any changes right away. be sure to let your doctor know if you feel even very small changes. what symptoms you may have will depend on which part of your body is affected by the cancer. call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: a change in bowel habits such as bleeding from your rectum bright red or dark blood in your stools frequent diarrhea constipation a feeling that your bowel is not emptying completely or stools that are narrow (may be no wider than a pencil) pain in your belly bloating or loss of appetite unexplained weight loss constant fatigue cough difficulty breathing or shortness of breath bone pain watchful waiting watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without giving treatment to cure your cancer. watchful waiting may be an option if treatment may cause more harm than good and is unlikely to cure your cancer. remember though that watchful waiting does not mean your doctor won't treat your symptoms such as pain. who to see if you have been treated for colorectal cancer doctors who can evaluate any new symptoms include: gastroenterologist. internist. family medicine doctor. colon and rectal surgeon. medical oncologist. radiation oncologist. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy? . i have had this for about a year now and i've been taking the drops for about 6 months now. i've also been taking a lot of ibuprofen and i'm not sure if i should take them at all.
Answer: hi just google this link for more info and the link you should find lots of info on this. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.

Answer: hi if you had a vaginal ultrasound it would be the best way to get a definitive answer. good luck
Expected Response: when i found out i was pregnant with my now 5 year old i had a similar situation. my doctor told me i wasn't pregnant but called me when i got home an hour later and told me there was a positive line and it turned out i was pregnant. also when i was pregnant i lost 25 pounds and only gained 15 of it back during my whole pregnancy. to me it sounds pretty normal. hope this helps. good luck

Question: can being inoculated with growth hormone as a child eliminate a person from donating blood now and in the future? why?
Answer: the answer is that you are not able to get a blood transfusion from someone who has not had a blood transplant. it is not possible to get blood transfusions from someone without having a transplant.
Expected Response: i don't think that would be a problem but then again blood banks set their own rules. those human growth hormones have been long gone in your case so there is really no way that your blood would harbor any residuals in my opinion.
================================================================================
Question: how much weight should i gain during pregnancy?
Answer: weight gain during the first trimester is not a good sign. weight gain in the first three months of pregnancy is a sign of an increased risk of developing anemia or other abnormalities of the small intestine. weight loss during pregnancy is not related to the size of the intestine. the size or shape of the intestines varies greatly from woman to woman. the most common size of a woman's stomach is about 1. 5 inches. the smallest intestine is about 0. 6 inches. women who have a large intestine are more likely to have anemia than women who do not have a small intestine or are overweight.
Expected Response: pregnancy doesn't equal a get-out-of-jail-free card for a caloric spending spree. if you gain too much weight you're at risk for conditions like gestational diabetes; too little and your baby may be born at a low birth weight. what's "just right" for you? if you're at a normal weight before pregnancy gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. if you are overweight before pregnancy gain 15 to 25 pounds. if you are underweight prior to pregnancy gain 28 to 40 pounds. for multiple births consult your doctor (usually you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds for twins). the average woman should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during her first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of her pregnancy.

Question: constant eye drainage including during sleep puffiness around eye top and bottom. i caught a cold approx. one week ago. since the beginning i have one eye that just drains constantly. the inner corner of my eye and just below the eye has become extremely irritated from the constant wiping/drying with a tissue is somewhat red around the outside of my eye. there has also been some slight lid swelling/puffines and very puffy under the eye when i wake in the morning. i have no idea if this is an infection or if i can do some otc "fix".
Answer: you are correct that you are having an infection. i am not sure what you are referring to but it sounds like an infection of the eye. the skin around the eye is a very thin layer of cells that can be damaged by the sun. this layer of skin is called the cornea. the corneal area is the most sensitive part of your eye. it is the area that is most
Expected Response: constant eye drainage should always be checked. if you have possibly damaged your cornea it could be leaking out slowly. it is very important to have it checked by your eye doctor. in some cases it is just allergies to something in the air. it can also be a problem with the tear ducts. but if it contiues with no let up do see a doctor.

Question: could i be pregnant? . i am 27 years old and have had my period for about a week. i was wondering if i could be pregnant. i am wondering if it would be safe to take a pregnancy test.
Answer: hi if you have had your period for 2 weeks then you should be ok its a very good test and will tell you if you are pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: the only way to know for sure you're pregnant is with a pregnancy test. but there are early symptoms of pregnancy that can alert you to the fact that you may be pregnant and should have a test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. some women are so attuned to their body and the changes it undergoes with pregnancy that they seem to know from the start they are pregnant. other women though have no suspicion they are pregnant until they miss their first period which is perhaps the most widely recognized early sign of pregnancy.

Question: i have combination skin. which kind of foundation will suit me?
Answer: i have a lot of skin problems. my foundation is a combination skin product. it is a very gentle product. i use it every day. i have tried to use it as a foundation but it is not as effective as it used to be. i would try to use a combination product again.
Expected Response: if your skin is very oily look for compounds that are "oil free. " for dry skin look for compounds that are non-comedogenic and hydrating. for combination skin first determine if your skin is more oily or dry and go from there. cream-to-powder bases work great for combination skin. mineral foundations work well on all skin types especially sensitive skin.

Question: i've been on paxil and klonopin for 20 years and now i have vertigo. is there a connection? . how long is too long to be on medication and can it cause vertigo?
Answer: there are no "natural" causes of vertigo but there are some common causes. there are a few things that can cause vertigigo: a lack of sleep or a lack in energy. you can get vertigo from a variety of causes including: a common cold or flu. a change in your diet. a lack or decrease in exercise. a decrease in your ability to walk. a loss of appetite. a drop in appetite. vertigo can be caused by a number of things including: alcohol or drugs. a stroke. a seizure. a heart attack. a sudden change in vision. vertigosis can also be caused from a stroke such as a heart failure. a person can have vertigida while on pd medication. this can be a
Expected Response: there can be hundreds (yes hundreds) of causes of vertigo. it would not be likely that medication that you have be taking for the last twenty years would suddenly cause vertigo so it would not be high on this list. check with your primary care provider first. but you may need to see a neurologist or ent specialist (since the inner ear problems are common causes) to start the evaluation process.

Question: does aspirin help prevent heart attacks and strokes?
Answer: aspirin is a powerful antioxidant. it helps protect the heart from damage and helps prevent heart disease. it is also a good antiplatelet and antiplatelets for people with high blood pressure.
Expected Response: i want to. talk about the use of aspirin for prevention of heart attacks strokes and other blood clotting problems. aspirin is commonly used for minor aches and pains and to reduce fever. aspirin also combats the effects of platelets blood cells that help blood clot. this helps reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes. indeed platelets are essential to human life because an excessively low count would cause bleeding. but platelets can also be involved in too much clot formation. when this occurs it can block a blood vessel and can lead to many potentially life-threatening problems including heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). it’s important to achieve a balance between too much clotting and not enough clotting. there is much confusion regarding the use of aspirin in prevention of heart attack and stroke. the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke — called primary prevention — is widely debated. there have been approximately seven clinical trials testing the effects of aspirin in someone with no prior history of heart attack or stroke. the doses have varied from 50 mg to 500 mg. while not all the trials showed benefit only one trial showed an increased risk of bleeding but those were patients on high dose aspirin. based on this ambiguous data the current american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention only in men with diabetes and intermediate cardiovascular risk and without an increased risk of bleeding. those patients who have a 10% risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period are defined as intermediate risk. the european society of cardiology guidelines do not recommend aspirin in primary prevention. in patients with previous stroke heart attack or certain other blood clotting problems aspirin has beneficial effects. for these people the american college of cardiology/american heart association guideline recommends starting aspirin 75 mg to 162 mg and continuing indefinitely in all patients unless other medical problems prevent its use. the benefits of aspirin need to outweigh the risk. yes it sure does. seven months ago my pulse went from around 55 to 65 count to over 200 beats. my blood pressure was steady at the 120 over 60. i was on a 325 coated aspirin since my by pass in 1999. i was on vacation at the time and when i seen my family doctor three weeks after it started he told me i had af and thanks god i was talking a 325 aspirin. my heart doctor agreed and now i am on pradax blood thinner. i have fluid in the lungs from the leaking blood and on a 40mg water pill. thank you toe fanjoy my hands and legs have been tingling and my right side has a pain can not move or cough it hurts

Question: how common is depression during and after pregnancy?
Answer: depression is a condition in which the body's immune system fights off an infection or infection. it is usually caused by a variety of conditions including allergies and certain cancers. depression is also called anxiety disorder or panic disorder.
Expected Response: depression that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after delivery is called perinatal depression. the exact number of women with depression during this time is unknown. but researchers believe that depression is one of the most common complications during and after pregnancy. often the depression is not recognized or treated because some normal pregnancy changes cause similar symptoms and are happening at the same time. tiredness problems sleeping stronger emotional reactions and changes in body weight may occur during pregnancy and after pregnancy. but these symptoms may also be signs of depression.

Answer: hi if you were to go through your period then you would be back to normal you could get pregnant again but you would need to wait a few months to see if you get your period again. but you should go see your doctor and get tested. good luck
Expected Response: the main way we first determine how far along a woman is in her pregnancy is by her period. further along in the pregnancy we can use other indicators including ultrasound. at this point there really is no way for you to know so you should go ahead and make an appointment with your doctor to touch base. they may want to do an ultrasound to get an idea of how far along you are.

Expected Response: anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimer’s knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and it’s often anyone’s guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (let’s call it rbd for short). the facts: * with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to “act out” your dreams. translation: you’re not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep. * these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: you’re not getting the restful sleep you need. * rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson’s disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. it’s not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinson’s as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinson’s disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? we’ve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia — eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise — both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good night’s sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking: * one in three people over 65 will die with dementia. * twenty percent of us don’t get enough sleep — banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average. * heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly “harmless” struggle to get a good night’s sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep.

Question: i have a sprained neck and have been seen by two different doctors. can i take two medications together as directed? . one doctor prescribed vicodin and the other prescribed nabumetone 750 mg.
Answer: i would suggest you see a doctor for a proper examination and a proper blood test to determine the cause of your neck injury.
Expected Response: i have a sprained neck and have been seen by two different doctors. one prescribed vicodin and the other prescribed nabumetone 750 mg. can i take both together as directed on each bottle? i do not recommend taking both without consulting one of the prescribers. these medications both treat pain but in different ways. they will not interact or increase toxicity levels from the ingredients. however it is important to check with your health care professional and keep them all in the loop about all the medications you are taking or have been prescribed.

Answer: the american academy of pediatrics (acsm) recommends that you self-prescribe (prescribing) adderapril (ritalin) and vicodin (amoxicillin) in addition to the over-the-counter medications that you currently take. self-inscribed adderance is a medication that is prescribed to treat a specific medical condition. it is not recommended that you take adderant or ralcin in addition. if you self prescribed adderan or ralin in addition you should not self-diagnose. if your doctor prescribes adderants or ralsin in
Expected Response: it is not wise to self-prescribe this potentially-addicting medication -- a potent stimulant. if you do not have a medical need for these drugs stay away from them. this is no different than self-prescribing "speed" or any other amphetamine simply because you are tired or want to stay awake.

Question: where are some good places to walk for exercise?
Answer: walking is great for getting out and about. it can be a great way to get out and enjoy life. it's also great to get to know people and find out about the things that people do. walking is a great place to get a good idea of what you can do to get yourself out and around. i recommend you to start walking by yourself. if you're a woman and you have a lot of health problems and you're overweight and you don't have a job you might be able to walk a little bit more. it might be a good thing to start with a few minutes of walking. if it's a group of people walking together then you might get a little more exercise. if that's a person with a disability and you want to get some exercise then you can start walking with them. if they're overweight or obese then they might want to start exercising with them too. if there's a physical activity that
Expected Response: the beauty of walking is that it can be done anywhere. here are some suggestions: when you travel (a great way to explore a new city). around your block. your local track. architectural walking tours. mall walking is great for cold or rainy conditions and it's great for social support and meeting new people. call your local mall to find out when its walking club meets (most of the time it's before the mall opens). trails in your local park. enter road races sponsored by your local running or walking club. many running clubs sponsor walking events too and plenty of people walk road races even when people are running. check out your local clubs. american volkssport association : a network of 350 noncompetitive walking clubs that organize more than 3 000 walking events per year in all 50 states. rails-to-trails : a nonprofit organization that converts abandoned railroad tracks into biking hiking and walking trails. go hiking. it's walking in the woods! check out the american hiking society for clubs in your area. check out local walks for causes in your area. the american heart association american diabetes association and many others sponsor local walking events. walk your dog!

Question: i get a salty taste in my mouth after i brush and rinse. what causes this?
Answer: it could be a chemical reaction in your mouth. it could also be something else. if it's just a mild taste or if you have a dry mouth then it could just be a reaction to the chemical reaction. if you brush it with soap and water it could cause a reaction. it may be a sign that you have an allergic reaction.
Expected Response: a salty taste in your mouth could result from a gum or decay problem or it could be a byproduct of a mouth rinse or toothpaste. sinus problems leaky crowns and fillings and certain metabolic health issues can also be a factor causing the salty taste to develop. get an examination from a dentist. you may also need a referral to see a doctor who is an ear nose and throat specialist.
================================================================================
Question: what is the connection between mitral valve prolapse and fibromyalgia?
Answer: the link between mitreleurin and fibrofibromyalgia is not clear. the link may be mediated by the two hormones testosterone and estrogen. testosterone is the active hormone of the male reproductive system. estrogen is produced in the ovaries. estrogen acts to stimulate the release of a hormone called prolactin. progesterone is produced by the pituitary gland in the pitus. in women with mitrelesis the pituar gland produces progesterones that help regulate the release and release of hormones from the pituerebellar glands.
Expected Response: mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is often seen in fm. i conducted a study years ago at the ohio state university and published results that showed the majority of people with fm also had evidence of mvp on cardiac echo testing. mvp is a condition where one of the heart valves the mitral valve bulges excessively during the heartbeat. although it sounds scary most doctors feel that mvp is usually a benign condition. it may contribute to atypical chest wall pain in some patients with fm or it may be part of the dysfunctional autonomic nerves and contribute to rapid heart rate palpitations and shortness of breath in some. we're not sure exactly why those with fm seem to have more mvp than the general population. perhaps there is a genetic factor involved or a dynamic change that results from the dysfunctional autonomic nerves. more research is needed in this area. chest pain in fm is usually not angina but people with fm can have other problems too including heart problems. if there is ever any questions about chest pain or new cardiac symptoms a physician should be consulted at once.

Question: can fatty liver disease be reveresed by the world as a disease?
Answer: the liver is the body's main organ. it is the main organ of the body. the liver contains about 4. 5 billion cells. about 1 in every 100 people has liver disease. the number of cells in the liver grows as the body ages. the body is divided into four major sections: the stomach and the liver. the stomach is the most important organ. the heart is the second most important. the lungs are the third most important and the kidneys are the fourth most important organs. the kidneys and liver are the only organs that can produce blood. the brain is the thirdmost important organ and the lungs and the brain are the fifth most important in terms of health. the other four organs are the pancreas the small intestine and the small intestines. the small intestinal is the smallest organ. in the intestines the small bowel is the largest organ. small intestine is the fourth largest organ
Expected Response: that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: 1. stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. 2. lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to 10% of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. 3. if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. 4. eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!

Question: i sprained my ankle over a month ago and i still have pains. . . i am sure it was over a month ago give or take a few days. but i am still experiencing pains in the back of my ankle on top and on the side some. i have went to the doctor and they did an x-ray and said things looked fine but since i am still having problems i feel like something else is wrong. could i possibly have a fracture or is it just a prolonged pain? . .
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's a tough time for many people. you may have a few more months to heal. you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. the best thing you can do is call your primary care provider right away. he or she can help you determine what's going on. if you can't see a doctor right away he or her may need to refer you to a specialist.
Expected Response: an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.

Answer: i don't know. i do not know your age or weight. i am just guessing.

Question: what is bun-creatinine ratio?
Answer: bun-catechins are a type of protein found in the blood. they are found in many foods such as breads cereal cereals and pasta.
Expected Response: bun stands for blood urea nitrogen. creatinine is a natural product of muscle breakdown that occurs at a low level in the body. both bun and creatinine are filtered by the kidney and excreted in urine. for this reason bun and creatinine are used together to measure kidney function. if kidney function begins to decline bun and creatinine rise. a normal creatinine depends on muscle mass and age. in general a normal creatine is 0. 5 to 1. 2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). a normal bun is 7 to 20 mg/dl. remember that different laboratories use different testing equipment and may have slightly different ranges for normal. a small temporary increase in either bun or creatinine can occur during illness or dehydration; the numbers usually return to normal during recovery. in cases of dehydration bun may increase in a higher proportion than the creatinine. a normal bun-to-creatinine ratio is between 10 to 1 and 20 to 1. (for example a bun of 14 and a creatinine of 1. 2 would be a ratio of 12. ) in cases of dehydration the bun-to-creatinine ratio may be higher than 20 to 1 as the kidney responds by making the urine more concentrated. other conditions that cause bun-to-creatinine ratio to rise are kidney disease kidney stones or bleeding in the intestines. low bun-to-creatinine can occur in pregnancy liver disease or a diet low in protein. the bun-to-creatinine ratio is not a precise or reliable test though. it may often be somewhat abnormal in healthy people. more important is the creatinine level itself; if it’s elevated the kidneys are not working properly and the reason should be sought out. i'm very concern about my kidney health since i'm getting older. my father and two of my brothers contracted kidney diisease in their 60's. all are deceased. recent ly i had bloodworkand my bun/creatinine ratio came back high (31) do i need to be concern? my doctor is well aware of my family history for this. thanks 1. 2 to 30 10 answer

Question: can a-fib cause heart failure. iam in 100% a-fib even with my pacemaker. will this cause heart failure. does it increase my chance of stroke.
Answer: it is possible for a-fee to cause heart disease. i am not sure if this is true but if you have heart failure it is very likely that you will have a stroke. it is not uncommon for a person to have a heart attack after having a pacemaker removed. i would suggest you get the heart work done.
Expected Response: unfortunately it can cause heart failure and does increase your chance of stroke. however there are many people who live with a fib and for a long time for that matter! i hope they find something that works for you!

Question: are there special side effects that can occur with cortisone joint injections?
Answer: cortisones are used to treat pain in the joints of the joints and are usually taken as a supplement to help treat pain. the best way to treat joint pain is to take the medication as directed. if you have any questions about using a joint injection or joint replacement method call your doctor.
Expected Response: cortisone injections into a joint may have side effects in addition to those described above. unique side effects of joint injections involve injury to the joint tissues particularly with repeated injections. these injuries include thinning of the joint cartilage weakening of the ligaments of the joint increased inflammation in the joint (arthritis) due to a reaction to a corticosteroid that has crystallized and introduction of infection into the joint.

Question: can a girl get pregnant with an unsevered hymen? . if you ejaculate a small amount of semen on the outside of a vagina of a virgin girl and she wipes her vagina off afterwards and takes a shower can she still get pregnant and what are the chances?
Answer: hi your find that there are many things that can happen to a girl's hymen if you have a hymen it can be a sign of pregnancy. but you need to be very careful. do not be alarmed if your spotting is too early. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: it is possible to become pregnant without full-penetration sex. while it may be uncommon ejaculation at the vaginal opening does put this woman at risk for pregnancy. if you do not want an unintentional pregnancy you should not be doing this sort of risky activity. keeping viable sperm as far away as possible from a vagina would be in your best interest. use a condom or stop playing sexual russian roulette.

Question: i get boils/absesses in my pubic area but they only happen at certain times of the year like fall/winter. . they start out as just a small red bump but usually get to the size of a quarter. they make a head and some pus and blood drain out but may remain red and hard under the skin for a week or so.
Answer: i have no way of blindly determining the cause of boils/abcesses from a simple blood test. i do know that the cause is unknown and may be related to a variety of conditions. if you are experiencing any of these symptoms you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: it may have sometime to do with your fall/winter attire. many of these boils start out as folliculitis (an infection around the hair follicles) so heat and/moisture in this area can be contributory to seasonal outbreaks. i don't know if you are shaving in this area but this too can be a factor.
================================================================================
Question: i recently got a rash on one side of my face. could a change in birth control pills be causing this rash?
Answer: no. it's not likely that the rash is caused by a change to birth control but rather a change of the skin flora. the rash can be caused by any number of things including a change or irritation of the lining of the mouth or nose. the best thing you can do is call your doctor or nurse practitioner and get a prescription for a topical steroid cream.
Expected Response: it is possible. any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect. however not all new symptoms are caused by medications. you would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash.
================================================================================
Question: how can toxoplasmosis during pregnancy be prevented?
Answer: the most important thing to do is to avoid any sexually transmitted diseases. you can prevent toxoplasma by: avoiding sexual contact with people who have toxoplasms. avoiding sexual intercourse with someone who has toxoplasia. avoiding contact with someone with toxoplasone b (bactrim). avoiding contact in a hospital setting. avoiding getting pregnant if you have a toxoplastic infection. avoiding having unprotected sex. avoiding taking birth control pills. avoiding smoking. avoiding using condoms. avoiding pregnancy. avoiding sexually transmitted disease (td). avoiding getting a tattoo. avoiding being sexually active. avoiding alcohol. avoiding masturbation. avoiding birth control.
Expected Response: if you are not pregnant (or not planning to be pregnant soon) and have a healthy immune system you do not need to prevent toxoplasmosis infection. it is a passing infection with mild or no symptoms. if you have had toxoplasmosis you cannot get it again. this is because your immune system has learned how to fight it. this immunity protects both you and your fetus from toxoplasmosis. you can have a blood test to learn whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis. if you are pregnant or plan to be pregnant soon if you do not know whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis or know that you are not immune avoid contact with the toxoplasma parasite to protect your fetus from infection. avoid cat feces in both the home and the garden. if you have a cat and you are either pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon have someone else clean the cat litter box. if you must clean the box yourself do it daily. the toxoplasma eggs take 1 to 5 days to become infectious. 4 wear gloves and a face mask and wash your hands afterward. make a habit of washing any table or counter surfaces that a cat may have walked across. consider keeping your cat indoors. a cat who goes outdoors is likely to become infected with toxoplasma gondii by eating infected birds or rodents. (eating indoor mice also poses a risk. ) when gardening or handling soil wear gloves and wash your hands afterward. wash all foods that could have had contact with cat feces including commercial fruits and vegetables. eat only well-cooked or previously frozen meat. avoid dried meats. sustained high or low temperatures are needed to kill toxoplasma gondii in meat. carefully wash your hands and all utensils after preparing raw meat poultry seafood fruits or vegetables. avoid untreated drinking water. this is a concern when you are in the wilderness or are traveling to developing countries where drinking water is not treated. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does alcoholism have an effect on congestive heart failure? my husband drinks 12 beers a day and is very bloated. he has been drinking a lot of beer. i am trying to get him to stop. is there a way to prevent this from happening?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're trying to prevent alcohol from causing heart disease. it's not uncommon for people to get heart disease from alcohol consumption. i'd suggest you speak to your health care provider about whether or not you should stop drinking. you can talk to your ob/gyn about whether you should talk to the ob/gynecologist about whether alcohol is a factor in heart disease or not. if you're not sure what you're talking about you should consult your ob-gyn. you should also talk to a cardiologist to help you sort out what's causing your symptoms. if alcohol causes a heart attack or strokes you may want to talk to an cardiologist. it
Expected Response: excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of congestive heart failure by causing a cardiomyopathy -- which is a medical term used to describe weakness of the heart muscle. this can result in swelling like your husband is experiencing. in addition liver damage from alcohol can also cause swelling. it sounds as though he should see a doctor urgently to try to help treat his symptoms and he would benefit greatly from some assistance to help him stop drinking.

Question: inside of my left ear and palatine tonsil is very swollen and red! help! . i'm 23 years old female. the inside of my left ear hurts every time i try to swallow anything. just under the ear whatever it is it's very swollen (you can clearly see the bump with your eyes) on my neck. inside the mouth the very end wall and palatine tonsil are very red and hurts whenever i touch it. i don't have any fever or runny nose or sore throat (throat doesn't hurt). i tried taking some antibiotics but it is not working well (maybe it's a viral infection? ). . please help! <negative_smiley>
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm sure you've heard of the "dysfunction" of the ear canal. the way it works is that your ear canal is very sensitive to pain. if you're feeling pain in the ear then you may have
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. i want to caution you however that you should never self-administer antibiotics. it's this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. your best bet is to see a medical professional. your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work. it could as you speculate be a virus. if it is it should clear up in 7-14 days. no antibiotics required. however it could be something other than a virus. many conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth. the only way to find out is to visit a health care provider. i wish you all the best!

Question: could i be pregnant? . i had sex with a friend 1 day before my fertile window. my period ended may 13 and fertile window starts may 18. and i'm three days late for my period and a took a pregnancy test and it was negative. i'm also taking a pregnancy and i haven't had a period in a while.
Answer: hi yes you should get your period asap good luck
Expected Response: hi and do we want to be pregnant? ok for now all you can do is wait around 4 more days then see your doctor and get a blood test done and see how that pans out. you could be just having a skipped or missed period if you have been stressing over this little event. if you are pregnant you could think of the abortion pill if your not interested at this time unless you want to keep it for me that would be your choice. and if your not pregnant then its time you was thinking of getting some kind of bc like the pill unless your body cant take it. but you have to remember safe sex is the best sex. good luck

Question: what is a nervous breakdown?
Answer: it is not uncommon for a person to have a nervous system disorder. a person may have a range of symptoms from mild to severe. it is important to talk to your doctor about your symptoms and the type of nervous system you have.
Expected Response: nervous breakdown is not a clinical term so it doesn’t mean anything specific to doctors. people may use nervous breakdown to describe an episode of severe emotional distress. the word “breakdown” may suggest the person showed unusual behavior or stopped performing his or her expected duties at home or work. people described as having a nervous breakdown may or may not meet the criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis.

Question: can pacemaker lead cause a chest muscle twitch. i have a st jude pacemaker and lift weights. i just started getting a muscle twitch in my left pectorail muscle. it is very random and it doesn't seem to affect my heart rate. is this common or should i have it checked?
Answer: i would have it looked at by your doctor. it may be a warning sign of something else.
Expected Response: while it's possible for people to experience muscle stimulation from pacemakers it's typically the diaphragm as it lies close the the right ventricle which is actually being paced. while i can't diagnose the cause of your muscle twitching in this forum i would guess that left pectoralis stimulation would be pretty unlikely particularly if it doesn't seem related to your heart rate. always helpful to get checked out by your doctor if you have any concerns.

Question: what if your appendix is hurting for 4 days without seeing a doctor? . it hurts when i cough and sneeze and barely keep anything down. i have no other symptoms.
Answer: you need to see a doctor. there are many different reasons why your appendix may be hurting. some of these reasons include: an infection. an infection in the appendix can cause the appendix to become inflamed. an enlarged appendix. an appendix may have a hard hard surface that makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients from the body. an ulcer. an aneurysm. aneurylosis. an enlargement of the appendix. a yeast infection. a bacterial infection. some people with aneuries have a lump on the inside of the abdomen called a "belly hole" or "bursa". if you have a yeast-infected appendix you may have an anaphylactic reaction. if you develop an anastomosis (an enlarged appendix) you may need
Expected Response: sorry to hear you're suffering through this. i think it's probably time for you to seek medical attention. the thing is. it could be your appendix. or it could be something else entirely. if it is your appendix and it's inflamed (swollen or possibly infected) it probably won't get better on its own. but then again it may not be your appendix at all. could be your gallbladder. or a hernia. the only way to tell for sure is to get a physical examination. if you're running a fever along with these other symptoms you need to see a doctor as soon as possible. think urgent care or emergency room. if you're not running a fever you might be safe to wait for an appointment with your primary care provider if you can get in within the next couple of days. feel better soon!

Question: i just started working out and while doing abs i have an extremely bad pain in the lower right section is this bad?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're having some sort of pain in your lower right side. it's not uncommon for pain to develop in the upper right side of your body. if you're not experiencing any pain in this area you probably are. if your pain is worse than usual it's probably due to a variety of conditions. some conditions can cause pain in both sides of your lower body. other conditions can also cause pain to occur in the right side or lower back. you can treat the pain by taking pain relievers or other pain relieving medications. if it's worse than normal you may need to see a medical provider to get an accurate diagnosis. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: whenever a person begins an exercise program it's important they have been cleared by their primary health care provider to do so and also that they learn to perform exercises using correct form. incorrect form can cause serious injury. the pain you experienced in your abdomen while doing an ab workout could be a result of something simple (like a strained muscle) or something more serious (like a hernia). if the pain doesn't clear up or if it gets worse or if you feel a bulge in your groin area or if you develop a fever over 101f you should seek medical attention. on the other hand if the pain was momentary and you haven't had any problems since the incident then you may be safe to take a wait-and-see attitude about this. hope this helps!

Answer: hi if you have been on a low dose of birth control for a while then you could be pregnant but you could also be having a period and not be pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: hi your hcg will only rise after implantation has happened so that's that one out of the way. the reason for no period symptoms could its just a skipped period it happens to lots of women sometimes at the wrong time as with you now. one more out of the way. if your cycle is a 28 day cycle so day one first day of your period? yes ok then day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day now you need to have unprotected sex 4 days before this reason it takes sperm 3 days to reach your womb and can live the for 5 7 or 10 days max this means its sitting there just waiting for you egg. get this working you should get pregnant but no matter what length your period is its always day 14. hope this helps you. good luck

================================================================================
Question: how long can the flu live in your home. my son has the flu how long until it is safe for my other children and grandchildren to come into my home?
Answer: the flu is not contagious until it has spread to your home or your family. if the flu does not spread to you your child or grandchildren will not be contagious. if you have a family member with the flu you should not be alarmed.
Expected Response: because people with the flu are contagious while they are ill and that they tend to be most contagious while they have a fever cdc advises people who are sick with flu to stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until after their fever is gone (without the use of fever-reducing medicines). if a sick person is around others we advise that they cover their cough and everyone washes their hands frequently. most flu is spread directly from a sick person to another person. while flu viruses can be spread by surfaces contaminated with flu viruses (such as by coughing on them) this is probably not a very efficient way to spread the virus. studies have shown that human influenza viruses generally can survive on surfaces between 2 and 8 hours in usual conditions.

Question: my grandson has had headaches and also running fever with it for over a month now not understanding why. any opinions?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're suffering from a migraine. you need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. if you have any questions about your migraines or your symptoms i'd suggest you call your health care provider. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: i am very sorry but we do not know anything about your grandson. not even his age. headaches and fever are very non-specific symptoms and could be signs of hundreds if not thousands of different medical problems. if he has not been carefully examined this would be your first step. he needs a diagnostic work-up.

Question: menopause or pregnant? . i am a 46 year old female and i have been using contraceptives for almost 20+ years and this is the first time i have missed my menstrual cycle. i am late for 4 days now. i feel like bloated and all the symptoms of the start of your cycle is what i am feeling now but not sure if i need to wait couple more days before i bought a home pregnancy test but i know my body and before that my partner and i did not have any intercourse 3 weeks before my cycle. please help.
Answer: hi ok well you have to wait at least a week before you get pregnant and then you can get pregnant again. but for now just wait a week and see how things go. good luck
Expected Response: if you have a "normal" 28 day cycle ovulation would be around day 14. your most fertile days would be days 10 to 17. three weeks before your period was due would be day 7 which would be a bit too early as sperm live a maximum of 5 days. they'd probably be dead before you ovulated.

Question: sshould i put toothpaste on a boil? . i have a boil in my mouth and i have been using toothpaste for a few days now. i have never had a boil before. i use toothpaste daily for a couple of days now and i use it for a while. i am not sure if it would be good to use tooth paste on a boiled boil or not. i just want to know if it is ok to put tooth paste in a boil.
Answer: you can use toothpicks on a boiling boil but you will need to see your dentist for an examination.
Expected Response: only if the boil had teeth. use hot compresses but if the boil is getting worse see your medical provider so it can be properly treated. treatment may include lancing the boil to relieve the pus and/or antibiotics.

Question: ok im gaining weight like im pregnant pregnancy test coming up positive but had a sonogram done an no baby what is it. my boobs also hurt i have all the signs of being pregant but i also want to be pregnant verybadly what could be goin on
Answer: hi there you go its just a simple test that will tell you if you are pregnant or not. if you think you have been pregnant you can get a test done at your doctors office or get a blood test done there. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i think this is something you should discuss with your gynecologist. it's possible you're experiencing a false pregnancy (the medical term is pseudocyesis) but the fact your home pregnancy test returned a positive result concerns me. there are a few rare cancers that can mimic the symptoms of pregnancy and you should ask to have those ruled out. you might also consider making an appointment with a counselor to discuss your situation. a counselor can help you cope with feelings of disappointment from not being pregnant when you so badly want to be and also can help you understand why your mind might be causing your body to exhibit the symptoms of pregnancy when you're not pregnant. wishing you all the best!

Question: can you become pregnant from being fingered if the fingers have wiped off?

Question: painful mole or skin tag burns constantly. a few years ago i noticed a small bump under my left armpit. at first it never bothered me and i thought it was going to turn into a skin tag but it never has. it is like a small plateau shaped mole that is about the same color as my skin. it constantly has a throbbing burning sensation to it and sometimes stings like being stung or poked with a needle. it is more irritating than anything and i was just wondering what it could be?
Answer: i would suggest you see a dermatologist. it could also be a skin cancer. i am not sure what you are talking about but it could just be a rash.
Expected Response: i would be wondering as well but you cannot make an important diagnostic call based solely on a brief description. any skin lesion that is painful or changing deserves to have a professional look at it first-hand. if the dermatologist is not sure (not all skin lesions can be identified by appearance alone) then it may be recommended to have it surgically removed. you would then have a "cure" (since it would be gone) and a pathological diagnosis -- the most accurate.

Answer: if you are concerned about your child's nose bleed it would be wise to see a pediatrician. it is very common for children to have nose bleeding in the early stages of development. if the child is not able to see the nose bleeder or the nose patch it is possible that the child may have a secondary nose infection. if your child has been diagnosed with a secondary nasal infection it is important to have this diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: if the bleeding was from the same side of the nose you may be experiening one nose bleed that has recurred three times. this happens when the scab that forms either fails to adhere to the slippery mucous lining and bleeds again or a probing finger dislodges it. as long as your child is not bruised in other areas or anemic nose bleeds are often more annoying than serious. you do need to know the proper way of controlling the bleeding so check on the webmd site for "nosebleeds" and you will find some helpful information. with that said. i am a bit concerned about the head injury. since i have no way to take a more thorough medical history or examine him this should be address with his medical provider. he doesn't have a head injury it was more for a "bump" than a "hit".

Question: how do i treat a pulled calf muscle? . if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury. if it's severe you should not treat it. if the muscle is in the groin area you should use a compression bandage. if you have a sore calf you should also use a bandage to prevent re-occurring pain. if there is a bump in the calf area you may need to use a new bandage (usually a band-aid) to relieve the pain.
Expected Response: if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury. painful calf muscle strains deserve “price” therapy (see below) and complete calf muscle tears (which are rare) may need surgical repair. the vast majority of pulled calf muscles will heal completely within a few weeks without any treatment. pulled muscles are also called muscle strains. they occur when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their normal length. the injury creates tears in the muscle that are usually tiny (microtears). in the most severe calf muscle strains the entire muscle is torn causing significant swelling and pain. the calf muscle (also called the gastrocnemius) is a commonly injured muscle. a pulled calf muscle most often occurs after vigorous activity (running jumping climbing stairs) but can happen with normal activity in middle-aged and elderly people. pain possibly with some swelling or bruising is the main symptom of a calf muscle strain. immediately after a pulled calf muscle using “price” therapy may help speed healing: p for protect from re-injury r for rest i for immobilize with tape or an athletic bandage wrap c for compression (make that wrap tight but not so tight your leg goes numb) e for elevate (keeping your calf muscle above your heart may reduce swelling) price actually stands for prevention rest ice compression evaluate elevate*** i had the same thing happen to me. you need to go to a sports medicine doctor and get an x-ray of you ankle. it might sound crazy but there is a possibility that you broke your tibia in your ankle. when you break your tibia your calf hurts then your ankle starts to hurt. i had this happen and i went to my physician and they said it was a mild sprang so i walked around for a month with a broken ankle and i just found out three weeks ago and i am still in a cast.

Question: been on birth control for four months showing signs of being pregnant. could i be pregnant? . i had my daughter four months old been on birth control after i had her. i was on the nuva ring and bleed the straight two months i was on it then my ob/gyn switched me the pill with no interuptions and i am still bleeding. its been kind light so i have had unprotected sex this whole time except for the weeks i was on my suppose to be regular period. i am now showing some symptoms of being pregnant. two home test showed up negative but is there a possibility i could still be pregnant?
Answer: hi if you have been on it for four years then you could be pregnant if you had unprotected unprotected sex then you should have had your period this way it would have come back after you had your periods. but if you still have problems getting pregnant then you need to see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: hi thanks for the query. as you delivered 4 months back i am thinking that possibly you are lactating the baby. in that case your doctor might have prescribed progesterone hormonal pills to you. if you use progesterone pills as per the guidelines the possibility of pregnancy is less. but if you missed the time of intake the possibility of pregnancy is there. for more details : <link> symptoms you mentioned could be due to the side effects of the pills also. once go for urine pregnancy test to clarity the doubts. take care.

Answer: the cause of the "shrinking" age of your son is unknown. he may have had a genetic disorder. this is not a cause for concern.
Expected Response: it could be genetic if his parents are small or he could have a growth hormone deficiency. the sooner the gets evaluated the better. get his in to see a pediatric endocrinologist asap since he is 15 now. growth hormone deficiencies must be treated before his growth plates close (while he is still growing).

Question: my mom has intestinal worms and has tried several home remedies. now she is experiencing some pain. what can she do? . i am in my mid-40's and have been taking probiotics for about a year now. i have been eating a lot of fruits and vegetables and am not having any diarrhea. i am also having trouble sleeping.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best! first of all i'd like to say that probiotics are a great way to help with your digestive issues. probiotics help with digestion. they also help with diarrhea. you can try a variety of probiotics and see what works best for you. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your doctor or pharmacist to see what probiotics you can take. it's important to note that there are many different types of probiotic. some are better than others. i hope you find something that works for you! if you have any questions about any
Expected Response: to eradicate intestinal worms you need a prescription medication based on the type of worm or parasite. this really needs to be checked out by a physician. there are specific lab tests that need to be done to make sure she is infected. there is not a product found over-the-counter that will treat worms or parasites. so be sure to work closely with her health care provider. .

Question: i had a cbc yesterday. i'm 58 f. not feeling well for the past 5 months. my hemoglobin was:7. 8. my hematocrit 28. 3. i would like to know if you consider this "severe". the dr. found a soft tissue mass in my upper middle abdomen. he's sending me to have ct scan of my abdomen with contrast. he's thinking some bleeding might be going on there. if so he has a surgeon picked out to do the surgery within a few weeks. i just want to know all the information i can so i can get to feeling better down the road! . many thanks/debbie feighner/fort wayne in texas
Answer: i am not sure what type of cbc you have but it is not uncommon to have a ct cbc scan. the cbc will tell you if you are having any blood loss or inflammation. most cbc scans are done by a c-section
Expected Response: i know you are worried debbie (please do not use your name in these postings or they may be deleted) and your doctor is wise to search for the many reasons for your anemia and finding what that abdominal mass might be is high on the list. the ct is a very accurate test so you will know more information once the scan has been read. obviously a cancer would be something to consider but not all abdominal masses are cancerous. if you are also having obvious or occult (hidden) rectal bleeding (detected on those stool tests) then this could be the source of your anemia but remember there are many different types of anemia. not just anemia from blood loss. your anemia is considered severe in my opinion so all efforts should be done to find the reason(s). if the ct shows that your mass is "suspicious" then the surgeon will take over your case.
================================================================================
Question: where do i start if i have never exercised?
Answer: you can start if you are already active but you will need to start exercising at least once a month. you can also start if your doctor tells you you to.
Expected Response: if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park farther away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. whichever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals: write down what activity you plan to do on what day of the week for how long and at what time of day. be as specific and realistic as possible. for instance write down "tuesday: walk for 20 minutes at 7 p. m. to the park and back. " at the end of each week review your goals and set new ones for the upcoming week. research shows that setting goals will help you stick to your program. it will clarify what you're supposed to do and let you track your progress. if you hit a roadblock later on you can refer back to what has worked in the past or use your accomplishments to re-energize yourself.

Question: what is colorectal cancer?
Answer: colorex is a cancer of the rectum. it is a type of cancer that is caused by the abnormal growth of a cancerous cell called a colon cancer. colorexs is caused in part by the growth of the cancerous cells in the colon. coloresis is a common cause of coloregion. colostomy is a surgical procedure in which the colon is removed from the abdomen and replaced with a small intestine. it usually is done in the u. s. and can be done in many other countries.
Expected Response: colorectal cancer happens when cells that are not normal grow in your colon or rectum. these cells grow together and form tumors. this cancer is also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. colon and rectal cancers often return months or years after treatment. this is called recurrent cancer. if the original cancer was removed before it was able to spread the chances that it will return are lower. metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. when colon or rectal cancer spreads it most often spreads to the liver. sometimes it spreads to the lungs bones or brain. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: husband's acl and meniscus in right knee are tore. i need some ab exercises he can do without moving his legs please. he is in the military and will have to continue doing pt which includes sit-ups pushups and running after the surgery and recovery. he needs some exercises he can do before and after the surgery to keep his abs as well as arm strength up. he has had some pain in his left knee and it is not related to the surgery. he can walk with his leg and do a few pushups.
Answer: i would suggest that you see a dr. for a physical examination. he or she can help you determine what is causing your knee pain. he/she can also prescribe some other exercises for your knee to help you get your knee back in shape.
Expected Response: the first thing to do is to make sure that your husband has medical clearance for exercise before initiating a program after surgery or during his recovery. your husband’s doctor or physical therapist should be able to provide example exercises but ace fitness also has a pretty comprehensive exercise library with a wide assortment of exercises as well. my recommended course of action would be to print out some of these exercises that seem tolerable to him and show them to his doctor or physical therapist to gain his or her approval on those specific exercises. practice caution when initiating an exercise routine so that your husband doesn’t aggravate his current condition or cause further injury. slow and gradual progression might be best. visit the ace exercise library located here: <link>

Question: what is the most effective antiwrinkle treatment for the eyes?
Answer: the most important treatment for those with the most severe eye problems is to use a topical retinoid cream (such as retinol or retinyl palmitate) or an eye cream that is not irritating.
Expected Response: your best way to fight premature wrinkling is sun protection. sun damage and smoking account for the majority of premature aging. in order to help combat wrinkling use compounds that exfoliate dead skin cells (glycolic and ahas) encourage new collagen deposition (tretinoin-based products) and provide nutrition for skin cells (vitamins c and e and peptides).

Question: can you take amlodipine and exforge together?

Question: what surgery options do i have for genital herpes?
Answer: genital herpes is caused by the herpes virus. genital herpes can be treated with antibiotics or other treatments. some people may be able to get genital herpes by using a condom or by using an oral contraceptive. if you have genital herpes you can get it from using a penile lubricant. if your partner has genital herpes he or she may also have genital virus. you can have genital outbreaks of genital herpes in your lifetime. genital outbreaks can be caused by any of the following: oral herpes. oral herpes can occur in the mouth or throat. oral infections can be transmitted through kissing or sexual contact. genital virus can also be transmitted from person to person. oral virus can be spread by direct contact with infected saliva or other bodily fluids. oral infection can be a sign of a sexually transmitted disease (std) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. oral outbreaks can occur as a result of a direct contact between the infected person and the
Expected Response: there is no need for surgical treatment for genital herpes. but if you are pregnant and genital herpes is diagnosed or suspected at the time of labor and delivery a cesarean section (surgical) delivery may be recommended to protect the baby from getting a herpes simplex infection which can cause serious health problems. a mother can pass the herpes simplex virus (hsv) to her baby if she has a sore or blister present during a vaginal delivery. the biggest risk occurs during a first-time (primary) outbreak of genital herpes. usually in these cases the woman either does not have symptoms or is unaware of symptoms. experts disagree about the use of cesarean section delivery in women with recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes. if a pregnant woman has recurrent outbreaks the risk of passing the virus to her baby is less than 1% because the baby has some immune protection from the mother. 1 cesarean section may be recommended if a woman has symptoms such as tingling or pain (prodromal symptoms) that signal an impending outbreak. for these women acyclovir ( zovirax ) used in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy may reduce the need for delivery by cesarean section by reducing the risk of a recurrent outbreak at the time of delivery. a cesarean section is usually not done if a woman with recurrent genital herpes has blisters or sores only on her thighs buttocks or another area that is not close to the vagina. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how many ribs do we have?
Answer: many people don't know that there are four ribs. three are in the back of the neck and the other two are in front of the head. the fourth is in the neck. the reason why these ribs are called ribs is because they are very hard and very painful. they are made of bone and they are not really strong. the ribs are made to last a long time and they tend to break down when you get older. so the ribs that are in your neck tend to be very tough and they can break down very easily.
Expected Response: both men and women have 24 ribs twelve on each side. each rib is attached to a spinal bone (thoracic vertebra) in the back. the first seven pairs of ribs join the breastbone (sternum) in the center of the chest. the front ends of the eighth ninth and 10th pairs are connected to the ribs above them. the 11th and 12th pairs are called “floating ribs ” because they are anchored in place only by connective tissue. one in every few hundred people have an extra rib. these are called cervical ribs because they arise from one of the spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae).

Question: what are some other possible early side effects from radiation therapy besides fatigue skin problems and hair loss?
Answer: you should always talk to your doctor about the possible side effects of radiation therapy. it is important to ask your doctor before you start any new treatment program. if you have any questions about the benefits of radiation treatment talk to a doctor or other health care provider.
Expected Response: other early side effects are usually specific to the site that receives the radiation. eating problems radiation therapy to the head neck or parts of the digestive system can result in loss of interest in eating. but it's important to continue to eat a healthy diet while undergoing treatment in order to maintain your health and keep up your strength. eating five or six small meals spread out through the day often works better than trying to eat three larger meals. trying new recipes can help you maintain your interest in eating. keeping healthy snacks that you enjoy on hand will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and perhaps losing your appetite. mouth problems before you start radiation to the head or neck see your dentist for a thorough exam to help reduce subsequent problems once therapy starts. radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: sores lack of saliva thickened saliva difficulty swallowing jaw stiffness. it's important to tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help reduce the discomfort you feel. to help manage these side effects: avoid spicy and acidic foods. don't smoke chew tobacco or drink alcohol. brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. hearing problems radiation therapy to the head can cause hearing difficulties. one possible cause is hardening of the wax in your ears caused by radiation. let your doctor know if you have difficulty hearing. nausea radiation to the head neck and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. let your doctor know if that occurs because there are medicines you can use to help control nausea. also the doctor or the nurse can help you learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. diarrhea radiation therapy to the stomach or abdomen can cause diarrhea which typically starts a few weeks after starting the therapy. the doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control the diarrhea as well as suggest changes in your diet such as eating frequent small meals avoiding high-fiber foods and being sure to get enough potassium. fertility and sexual issues radiation therapy in the region of the pelvis can affect your fertility and your sex drive. it's also important not to try to become pregnant during radiation therapy because radiation can hurt the fetus. radiation therapy of the pelvic region can cause women to stop having menstrual periods and to experience other symptoms of menopause. it's important to talk with your doctor about what kind of effect radiation might have on your ability to have children in the future. in men radiation in an area that includes the testes can affect the sperm count as well as the functionality of the sperm. this doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. but if you want to have children later you should talk with your doctor about considering the use of a sperm bank before treatment begins. treatment to the pelvis can cause sexual intercourse to be painful for some women and can also cause scarring that affects the ability of the vagina to stretch. in men radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that make an erection possible. you should discuss your concerns with your doctor before treatment begins to learn about your options and possible outcomes. it's natural to have less interest in sex when undergoing treatment for cancer. but typically your sex drive will reawaken after treatment stops. talk with your spouse and share your concerns about the need for being close.

Question: how can computers affect my child’s sleep?
Answer: the answer is yes. computers can cause a child to sleep worse than normal. this is because they can cause an increase in the amount of sleep that a child is able to get. the key is to make sure that the child is getting enough sleep. if you have a child who is sleeping better than normal then it is important to make an appointment with your doctor or a sleep specialist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
Expected Response: you should probably be looking at what your children are looking at on the internet anyway whether it’s video games or things of that nature. just sitting in front of a screen and the light that is produced from that screen actually has been shown in one japanese study to affect the child’s circadian rhythm. in what way? well what it can do is it can actually throw off the circadian rhythm. they found with laptop computers with both adults and i want to say it was high school age kids that they found that it actually made them stay awake because light in front of them doesn’t produce the melatonin during that portion of the night. i usually recommend parents to have times for the tv times for the computer and not to go past those times and to really limit that access.
================================================================================
Question: can one refuse psych treatments under obamacare based on religious preference?
Answer: yes. the health insurance marketplace is a marketplace for people with a religious preference.
Expected Response: most helpful answer i'm not sure i fully understand the question but let me try to cover as many bases as possible. certainly you won't be required to undergo any psychological treatments as a result of the law. unless treatment is court ordered you always have the right to refuse it. if what you're asking is whether you can buy a health plan that does not pay for mental health and substance abuse services the answer is no. there are religious exemptions under the law that would allow you -- if you meet criteria -- to avoid having to buy insurance at all. but there is no way for you to buy an insurance policy and pick and choose the specific benefits that come with it based on your personal belief system.

Question: what is the difference between osteoporosis and scoliosis?
Answer: osteoporsias are caused by a genetic defect in the bone marrow. the bone cells that make up the bone are called osteoporis. the abnormal bone cells are called "lobes" and they are the result of the body's immune system reacting to the abnormal cells. the body can fight off the abnormal lobes by either destroying them or by making them inactive. the immune system destroys the lobed cells and makes them inactive again. the disease is called osteopenia. osteoporiasis is caused by the inability of the bone to grow properly. the normal bone cells (called osteoporegonal) do not grow properly and are lost. the loss of bone cells is called bone marrow disease. osteopenias are not caused by any disease but the symptoms of osteoporuosis can be caused by many conditions. for example a person with osteopoietic disease can

Question: can i give my 16-year-old claritin (generic version loratadine) with tylenol cold/sinus?
Answer: claritins are not an effective treatment for colds. they may cause a temporary worsening of the symptoms of colds such as fever vomiting cough or diarrhea. claritinoin is not an antibiotic.

Question: will losing weight help my urinary incontinence problems?
Answer: i think it's time for you to see your medical provider for a proper examination. it sounds like you may have a urinary incurable disease. your provider may be able to help you with some of the following things: a urinary tract infection. this is a common problem that can be caused by the urinary tract. urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria that are found in the urinary bladder. bacteria that cause urinary increta. this can cause a urinary infection called uti. this infection can be very painful and can cause discomfort in the groin area. urinary incitus. this problem can be a sign of urinary incitis. a urinary bladder infection can also cause urinary tract problems. if you have a uti you should be evaluated by a doctor who can examine you for urinary incutility. if your doctor suspects you have uti then you should see a urologist.
Expected Response: well here's another reason to lose a few. if you are having urinary incontinence problems you may find that losing some weight will make the problems less severe or they may go away altogether. many studies have shown a connection between obesity and urinary incontinence in women especially stress urinary incontinence (you leak when you are coughing laughing or putting physical "stress" on your bladder). excess body weight tends to increase bladder pressure (increased weight on the bladder and pelvis) and may also impair blood flow and nerve impulses to the bladder. studies show a positive correlation between high bmi. and urinary incontinence and the correlation is more pronounced in women than in men. research has also shown that very obese women who undergo extreme weight loss due to gastric surgery see a decrease in their stress urinary incontinence symptoms. in other studies women who achieved a greater than 5% weight loss following weight watchers experienced a greater than 50% reduction in their urinary incontinence symptoms. that means that if you weigh 200 pounds and lose just 11 of them you could reduce your incontinence issues by half! losing weight if you are overweight and maintaining normal weight throughout adulthood may be important approaches to controlling or eliminating urinary incontinence symptoms especially in women.

Question: how can parkinsons disease be prevented?
Answer: parkinson's disease is caused by the same genes that cause parkinsonism. parkinson is caused primarily by the genes that make you park. the most common cause of parkinson disease is a genetic disorder called parkinson syndrome. this disorder is caused mostly by the parkinson gene. the other two genes that are responsible for parkinson are dopamine and serotonin. the dopamine and dopamine-containing genes are responsible primarily for making you feel like you are having a seizure. dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is produced by the brain. serotonin is a hormone produced by a nerve cell called the pituitary gland. it is produced in response to an attack of the pitus. when the pituar gland attacks the pitum it releases serotonin into the pit. this serotonin causes your body to produce a pituitar hormone called serotonin 2 receptor. this pituitariasis causes your brain to produce pituitaries that are called pituitritic cells
Expected Response: there is no known way to prevent parkinson's disease. research has shown that people who eat more fruits and vegetables high-fiber foods fish and omega-3 rich oils (sometimes known as the mediterranean diet) and who eat less red meat and dairy may have some protection against parkinson's disease. but the reason for this is still being studied. 4 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. it is not unusual for a person to have a very bad reaction to antibiotics. it would be best to see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. there are many things that can cause a person's symptoms to worsen.
Expected Response: no it's not unusual. the effects of the illness will still exist because it takes a while (a week or so) for the bug to be annihilated by the penicillin and your immune system. also penicillin increases your white blood cell count and so your own body is still fighting the bug. the medication itself doesn't fight it. your body is still going through the purging process of getting rid of the bug. so you will still feel sick and tired for a while. taking too much penicillin can cause ill effects as well so try not to do that. just let it run it's course.

Question: compare palliative with hospice care. i am currently on hospice and am currently in the hospital. i have been prescribed hospice for my family and i am not able to afford it. i can't afford it because i am disabled.
Answer: you can get a plan through your state's health insurance marketplace. you can also try the marketplaceplaces on the go. the marketplace is a great place to start shopping for affordable care. if you are in the market for a private plan you can buy a plan online or by calling your state health insurance assistance program (ship) or by phone at 1-800-318-4227.
Expected Response: palliative care and hospice care often are mentioned in the same sentence as if they are the same thing. they are not but they do share certain characteristics. hospice is care for people at the end of their lives and their families. hospice care encompasses physical emotional and spiritual support. it is not offered only to the dying person but to the entire family as well. hospice care is not about prolonging life; it is about providing comfort care and measures designed to enhance the dying person's quality of life. and this is the point where hospice and palliative care overlap. palliative care too is about maximizing a person's quality of life. however palliative care is not just for patients with limited life expectancy. any person with a serious illness or chronic medical condition may benefit from palliative care. palliative care takes a holistic approach to addressing pain--physical and/or emotional--and other issues of comfort. for example a palliative physician might order special skin creams to minimize the pain and tissue irritation from radiation therapy for cancer. palliative team members may include specially trained physicians nurses psychotherapists social workers physical therapist occupational therapists nursing assistants and others. this team focuses treatment on the patient but also offers support to family members. i hope this helps!

Answer: i have no way of seeing your child's symptoms based solely on the symptoms you describe. i would strongly suggest that you see a medical provider. he or she will be able to examine you and determine what is causing your symptoms.
Expected Response: maybe. yellow-green mucous is not a definitive sign of a bacterial infection in a two year old but it could be. this color change is usually caused by stagnation of the flow of mucous just the way a pond turns green if there is not a good in and out flow of water. two year olds do not blow their noses. if your child is ill or feverish. if he seems to be getting progressively worse. then yes seeing his medical provider would be a wise decision.

Expected Response: the goal should not be to lower your metabolism but to start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain. it doesn't matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein calories and nutrients. that's because inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake (total calories) means protein is used for energy instead of for muscle formation. exercising more can increase your appetite and weight training can gradually help you put on muscle. it may take time to see results but because muscle weighs more than fat you are likely to gain weight. here are some tips: eat regular meals and snacks every day. try to plan your meals ahead of time and have items you can put together for quick and healthy meals. gradually build a list of balanced meals you can make for yourself. include 3-5 food groups at meals including a whole grain lean protein fruits vegetables dairy and healthy fats. for example in the morning you might have a big bowl of oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts and a side boiled egg. include 2-3 food groups at snack time which may consist of cheese and whole grain crackers or an apple with peanut butter or half a meat sandwich with veggie sticks. gradually increase exercise to include cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. for tips on how to exercise to build muscle see this article. what you may discover during this process is how much better you feel by moving more and eating better. you won't regret starting on a healthier road! i here this a great deal at the school i teach at. if you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan. first keep a food diary for three days. are you really eating as much as you think? when counseling athletes at school i generally recommend they consume 1. 8-2. 0 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. so for you at 150 lbs = 68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122 -136 grams a day. now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need. develop an eating plan. here's an example: breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk protein in meal = 20 grams lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts (8 ounces) 2 cups of veggies (broccoli green beans califlower) 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt protein in meal = 69 grams dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin (3 ounces) remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 1/2 cup fat free cottage cheese protein in meal = 38 grams snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter (protein: 7 grams) 1/4 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit (protein: 12 grams) total protein for the day = 147 grams notice there's no junk food (chips soft drinks etc) or any expensive supplements just good solid nutritional foods. regarding exercise the best way to add weight is by adding muscle. to do this you need a well thought out strength training plan. follow the link pasted below to find a great beginners workout on webmd <link> as you advance you can find some additional info here <link> <link> like i said earlier the key to healthy weight gain is with a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan both of which you can find here at webmd. to be on the safe side be sure to check with your physician before starting. i had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts. i had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class. let's keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle mass/weight. 1. rest - get two days/week of rest to recover from training. you grow when you're resting. you can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously. take it easy on those days and don't do anything too physical. 2. train - lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 1/2 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics. next day do it in reverse. repeat this cycle throughout the week. if you're an athlete you'll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day. when running do sprints. do high impact high intensity exericises. do not perform long-distance endurance training. if you have to run don't go over 3 miles. 3. eat - consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits. 3/4 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat. 1/4 of your meal should be protein to build muscle. contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle. consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein. you want that carb for energy to push harder and grow bigger/stronger. eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal. you will bulk up in size/strength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month. if you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs. always drink a ton of water! find people with similar goals to train with! it's not just about building your body it's also about building a community. good luck!

Question: how do i deal with the guilt of not taking my mother to family events? she has alzheimer’s and can’t handle crowds. my sister and i agree it would do more harm than good. i don’d want to take her to the family events.
Answer: i would suggest you go to a family event and talk to the person who is responsible. you may have to take a family trip for the family event. you can also take a trip to the doctor's office to get a diagnosis. the doctor will need to see you and explain the situation.
Expected Response: families often feel emotional at holiday time especially if a parent is unable to join them to celebrate. you and your sister seem to be aware and respectful of your mother's needs and comfort and that is to be commended. you are doing her a service by not overwhelming her in a crowd. if it is possible you can celebrate with her in a different setting and at a different time. most facilities plan holiday celebrations for residents at a time different from the specific holiday. this enables families to come there and dine with their loved ones rather than taking them out of their "comfort zone. " if her memory support unit does not offer this then you can plan your own "mock thanksgiving dinner" with her. it is common for memory-impaired persons to be disoriented to day/time so you will be creating a thanksgiving day of your own.

Question: why is a “power down hour” important to good sleep?
Answer: “the “time to be awake” is a crucial part of our daily lives. ” we need to be able to get out of bed at the right time and not be distracted. “sleep is the most important part of a healthy lifestyle. ’ so if you “have “a “Power down ” you’ll be able” to take care of your sleep. ‟ sleep is a great way to get fullness and rest. ‘sleep is a way to feel better. ‡ sleep is the best way to be productive. ‥ sleep is one of the most precious assets we have. ‫ so if we “had ” a ”power down “ we’d be able ” to sleep at the optimal time. „ sleep is an important part” of a healthful lifestyle.
Expected Response: one of the things i talk about in my book is having what’s called a powered down hour. and in the power down hour you have 3 twenty minute segments. so the first segment is forgetting stuff done that you just have to get done or it will drive you crazy. so in our house it’s getting backpacks ready for school finding shoes you know things that you do when you have kids. the second twenty minutes is reserved for hygiene so brush your teeth wash your face maybe even take a hot shower or bath. the final twenty minutes is reserved for meditation relaxation stretching things of that nature that i’d want you to do in bed and i’d want you to do it in the dark okay. because what that does is again it sets that mood and allows you to start to fall asleep. now many people don’t have an hour before they get into bed so you can do the power down half hour if you want like 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes.

Question: how soon i see if hormon therapy change me from male to female. i have been trying to get pregnant for over a year now. i'm not sure if i should get pregnant or not. i've been trying for over 2 years to get my period but i'm scared that i'm going to be able to get it.
Answer: hi well you need to get your hormones back on track just do a test and see how it goes then you could be pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer well i hope you understand that taking female hormones alone will never physically change your genitalia to that of a woman. in other words you will still have a penis and scrotum. however female hormones will gradually feminize your appearance and you will grow breasts. as i say this is a gradual process. it doesn't happen overnight. more like weeks to months. if you're transgender (as i'm assuming you are) i hope you're under the care of a trusted medical professional. i've had the privilege of working with many transgender patients and i know that products circulate illicitly within the community. i would urge you not to attempt to use female hormones without medical supervision. you don't necessarily know what you're getting with some of those black market products products purchased from websites and so on. if you are under the care of a medical professional good for you! he or she should be able to help guide you through the complexities of changing genders. i wish you all the best on this journey!

Question: what are all the treatment options for straightening a penis that has been bent in an angle due to tight underwear? . 19 year old. had a perfectly natural straight penis with an upward curve (like a perfect banana) in childhood up until puberty. used to wear tight underwear and slept in a certain way (putting penis in between legs) with erection until morning. penis no longer curves upwards but now curves downwards and to the right. when i'm excited penis gets very hard especially glans and the shaft turns into an hourglass figure which feels good & goes away after full erection. penis doesn't hurt at all. i have no other symptoms.
Answer: hi try this link from webmd it may help you. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: there are two chambers in the shaft of the penis called the corpus cavernosa. when blood engorges the corpus it should equally fill but in some cases one side gets more blood than the other causing a deviation. in severe cases where one side of the corpus does not engorge at all this is called peyronie's disease. the blood supply may be due to a plaque or blockage. this is not caused by tight underwear. as a matter of fact tight underwear should have no adverse effect on the angle of your erection whatsoever. since you cannot be adequately diagnosed over the internet and since this change is concerning you you will need to see a urologist (find a male urologist) to be properly evaluated.

Question: is it possible to have had chlamydia for over 17 years and not know it? after having a child as well with no symptoms? . i was recently hospitalized with abdomen pain. they did the regular std checks to rule out pid. all came back negative but they want to take one for chlamydia. i have only been with my husband for over 17 years and vise versa. is it really possible i could have had it that long and not known? or am i worrying for nothing?
Answer: hi i think you should have had a test done to check for chlydia but not sure if it was your period or not but it could have been. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi you should find this info very interesting and the way chlamyda can hide for many years. most unfortunate is the ability of chlamydia to hide itself deep inside the genitourinary tract making it very difficult to detect by urethral swabbing and urine analysis; two commonly used sample collection methods for chlamydia testing in clinical practice. thus many urologists and std doctors are unable to identify chlamydia as a causative pathogen. as a result they often make general diagnosis such as non-specific urethritis prostatitis and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) etc. and they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patient’s condition more complicated; weakening the immune system causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative pathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc. do hope this helps good luck

Question: is it ok to break your blood pressure tablet in half later if your blood pressure is still high. i take blood pressure meds and sometimes it still goes up. not for long. i was curious can you break your tablet in half and take it if it has been a while since you took the first whole med. i am a bit concerned because i have been taking the meds for a while now.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'm glad you're taking the medication. it's important to take your blood pressures seriously. if you're not sure how much medication you're on you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist. if your doctor doesn't know how much you need to take he or she may prescribe it. if it's too late for you to take it you should consult your doctor. if the medication is too late you should call your doctor again. you may want to consult with your health care provider to find out if you need a prescription
Expected Response: i can see why you would ask this question. it seems like a very logical solution doesn't it? however i would not advise doing this. first of all there are several different types of blood pressure pills. some of them work by relaxing blood vessels. others work in the kidneys. others work by reducing blood volume ("water pills"). taking a little extra of one type of pill might not harm you while taking extra of another type of pill could cause your blood pressure to go dangerously low. second it's normal for your blood pressure to fluctuate throughout the day and even in different situations. for instance your blood pressure may go up if you've recently been walking (or for some people simply standing up). your pressure can go up if you're angry anxious or feeling emotional. on the other hand your blood pressure can go down if you're feeling very relaxed or if you've been lying around all day. this is normal. the important thing with blood pressure medication is that it controls your pressure "on average. " if your pressure usually falls within an acceptable range as determined by your healthcare provider then you're doing fine. however if your pressure is often or regularly elevated even though you take your medication as prescribed then you should let your medical provider know. lastly don't take your blood pressure too often. there's no point. taking it once a day at the same time every day usually is sufficient. take it around noon or 1pm if possible. always write down your readings (and note if you were sitting down walking angry or anything that could affect your reading) and take this information to your doctor appointments. your provider will appreciate getting this feedback. wishing you well!

Question: what is non viral hepatitis?
Answer: non viral hepatic hepatitis is not caused by any virus. it is caused by the hepatitis c virus (hcv) that is transmitted through the saliva of infected people.
Expected Response: hepatitis simply means "inflammation of the liver. " while most people think of the viral hepatitis varieties ( hepatitis a hepatitis b hepatitis c and so on) when they hear the term "hepatitis " the truth is many things can cause liver inflammation -- not only viruses. a few non-viral causes of hepatitis include: alcohol abuse drug abuse environmental toxins trauma (injury to the liver) fatty buildup in the liver (often caused by poor diet habits) autoimmune diseases (a situation in which the body's antibodies attack its own tissues including the liver) some of these types of non-viral hepatitis may be reversible with behavior modification. others may be chronic (that is lifelong). if you have questions about your liver or if you've received a diagnosis of non-viral hepatitis feel free to discuss your questions and concerns with your health care provider. wishing you well!

Question: lost 50lbs since 4/12 injured my back and had surgery in 9/12 and probably again in 12/12. how do i keep the weight off? . started nutrisystem 4/12. . had my gallbladder removed 6/12. . quit smoking on 7/12. . 9/12 i got a shooting pain down my legs and soon after went numb between my legs. i had emergency surgery and am still in a lot of pain. might need a spinal fusion but insurance is fighting it. . how can i continue to lose weight when i am unable to exercise. i tried to do all of the right things to get healthy and am having no luck. any suggestions? . thanks . carrie
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best! it's impossible to tell you how to lose a weight without a physical exam and some basic physical therapy. you're probably not going to be able to do much
Expected Response: first off congratulations on your weight loss! i think you have a couple of choices right now. you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery. in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity. it's best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program. i don't know how much weight you have to lose the calories you've been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration. i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism. you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do. i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight. you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success. and just because you are not losing weight now doesn't mean you won't be able to in the future. good luck!

Question: my 25 year old son lost his adderall and can't get a replacement for 30 days. is there an over the counter alternative? . my son got his new monthly prescription two days ago and inadvertently threw the bottle away thinking the bag it was in was empty. he will not be able to get his monthly dosage until his next appointment in 30 days. is there a safe over the counter alternative he can use which at the least will help to lessen the focus and concentration issues that will inevitably arise. thank you for any guidance you can give.
Answer: i would suggest you call your local pharmacy and get a prescription for a prescription medication. you will be able and willing to help him find a prescription that is right for him. you can call your pharmacist or health care provider to discuss the best prescription medication for him or her. you may also want to look into a prescription drug store. if you have questions about a prescription you may want to ask your pharmacy or health insurance company
Expected Response: no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.

Question: what are the problems with picking a 24 pound child up by her wrists? . this child is 20 months old and has been subject to this since she was crawling. please advise.
Answer: i don't know anything about your child or her medical history but i do know that she is very nervous and very nervous about picking up a baby. it would be best to see her pediatrician or a pediatric endocrinologist for a hands-on examination and perhaps some diagnostic tests.
Expected Response: the problem usually doesn't occur in the wrist but the elbows. it is quite easy to painfully dislocate the elbow (subluxation of the radial head). this is called the "nursemaid's elbow". it is best not to do this.

Question: i lose control when i drink and don't know when to stop until is too late. am i an alcoholic? . i have been drinking for a few days now and i'm not sure when to start. i've tried drinking before but never been able to stop. i don't have any other symptoms. i'm very tired.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'd suggest you see a health care provider for a proper examination. the sooner you can get to the bottom of this issue the better. it's important to keep in mind that alcohol consumption can affect your immune system. if you're still having symptoms you can try reducing the amount of alcohol you consume. drinking plenty of fluids may help you stay hydrated. if this sounds like you're having a hard time controlling your alcohol intake it's time to see a medical professional. if your symptoms are severe you may need to see your health care professional. i hope you feel better soon!
Expected Response: you have come to an important point in your life - your drinking is not making your life better it is clearly making your life worse - and i also sense that you are worried. if your gut is telling you to worry do not ignore it! i would first advise you stay away from the people places and things that have been part of your "alcohol-using life. " there are now more types of help available than ever before and most are more accessible to you than ever before. the easiest most accessible and most affordable (free) is aa. counseling with a professional addictionologist is also an option. however if you find that your best efforts to help yourself with only modest assistance do not work that is a very clear sign that you need professional specialized help. that help comes from an alcohol/drug treatment program. whatever you do — meetings counseling and/or treatment - don't drop out. there are over 20 million people in long term recovery from serious substance abuse. and you could be the next one! if the question “am i an alcoholic” has crossed your mind at least once then you must think that you may need help with your alcohol use. one of the most common stumbling blocks which prevent many people from getting the help that they need is denial. seeking assistance for chronic alcohol abuse is a step that many find difficult to take. according to alcoholics anonymous if you cannot quit your alcohol abuse even if you want to; and if you cannot control how much you consume in one instance then you are probably an alcoholic. there are many online self-assessments that ask you to consider your alcohol use by asking the following questions: • does drinking make you feel shame or guilty? • do you have alcohol cravings? • are you at risk of losing your home family or job because of your drinking? • does drinking change your personality? • do you miss work because of drinking? • does drinking affect your home life? • have you lost your ambition or goals because of drinking? • do you have family members that have drinking problems? if you can answer yes to any or all of those questions according to the self scoring assessments you are probably an alcoholic. there are many different options for help in quitting alcohol use including detox rehab 12-step programs and counseling. make a commitment to stop get involved in a program and be pro-active in your recovery. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Expected Response: worse in what way? if a person ate of teaspoonful. just a teaspoonful of either of these food sources they would be just fine. one may have more calories than the other but when you compare it to the total day intake it would not make much of a difference. peanut butter has more protein but i don't know what kind of ice cream you are eating. who can eat just a teaspoonful?

Question: my daughter has very painful blisters in her throat without fever or swollen glands. what could be the cause? . she is 5'11" and weighs 130 pounds.
Answer: hi well this is from the uk’s nhs you can read about it here. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what are the side affects of taking 3 to 5 times recomended otc probiotic would it cause unhealthy weight loss. i think this is causing my wife to loss weight by stopping nutrition being absorbed by her body. i am not sure what the side effects are but i am worried.
Answer: i would suggest you consult your health care provider to see if this is a problem.
Expected Response: most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as "natural" or "healthy" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the "good flora" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!

Question: do i need a tetanus shot for a thermal burn? . i burned my hand on a pan today while i was making cinnamon rolls my thumb was only on the pan for less than a second. the burn is white but not bubbling or anything its just a white mark. i ran it under cool water for like 30 minutes and added aloe. it barely hurts. im planning on getting a tetanus shot this year anyways but i need to know if this is very serious or i can just get my shot whenever.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a bit of a shock to hear you're dealing with this. tetanus is a viral infection that can spread to other parts of the body. it can be transmitted to others by direct contact. if you have a fever or a sore throat it's probably not contagious. however it's important to note that tetanus can be spread through direct contact with an infected person. you can get tetanus from a
Expected Response: tetanus (the disease) is quite rare but the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing it if you have one every ten years. minor burns like you described are not high risk for tetanus. not knowing when you had your last one i cannot advise you specifically but having a tetanus shot now -- if you are due for one anyway -- would be a good idea. i should have added. "quite rare in the united states". unfortunately tetanus is much more common in other countries.

Question: what is epilepsy?
Answer: epilepsy is a condition in which the brain's electrical impulses are directed toward certain parts of the body. epilepsy is caused by a variety of conditions including: epilepsy. epilepsy can be caused by any of the following: epilepsy (also called epilepsy with or without symptoms) is a progressive disorder in which a person's brain cells are constantly firing. seizures are caused by the abnormal firing of the brain cells in the brain. seizures can be triggered by any number of causes. epilepsy may be caused because the brain changes in response to a seizure. epilepsy often is caused when the brain switches from a normal state to a new state. epilepsy usually is caused in the head. epilepsy occurs when the body's electrical signals are directed at certain parts in the body such as the eyes eyes ears and the brainstem. epilepsy sometimes is caused because a person has a high fever or other medical conditions. epilepsy also can be a result of a stroke or other serious injury. epilepsy affects about 1 in
Expected Response: epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than 2 million people in the united states -- about 1 in 100 -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.

Expected Response: most helpful answer drug store clinics are just fine for this type of medical issue. you may have a case of otitis externa and need some prescription antibiotic/steroid ear drops. in the meantime a solution of 50% white vinegar (acetic acid) and 50% water - a few "body temperature" drops instilled in the problematic ear a few times per day will help i would go to the er and see if they can help you afford it. sorry could be much help but that's what i did when my son had the same thing they had to put tubes in his ears.

Question: is melatonin a dietary supplement for acid reflux?
Answer: melatonin is a dietary vitamin supplement. it is not a dietary product. it does not contain any other drugs or other ingredients.
Expected Response: no it's not. melatonin is a hormone made by a small gland in the brain. melatonin helps regular your sleep-wake cycle. it is sold as a dietary supplement for people who have trouble sleeping. some people say melatonin is helpful for getting over jet lag. these claims may be true but have not been proven by good studies yet. i'm not sure what supplement you might be thinking of for your acid reflux but there are many over-the-counter remedies available to you. you can always ask the pharmacist for advice on what antacid product might be best for you. some antacid products can interfere with medication absorption so it's a good idea to check with your pharmacist or health care provider before choosing an antacid. wishing you well!

Question: does lipo flavonoid reduce or cure tinnitus?
Answer: hi if you have tinnitis then you need to see your doctor for a blood test to see if this helps. good luck
Expected Response: the short answer to your question is: no. currently there is no cure for tinnitus unless it's caused by a curable underlying condition (such as taking too much aspirin). tinnitus (or "ringing in the ears") can be more than annoying. it can become a debilitating problem in which the "noise in the ears" can drown out other sounds including a loved one's talking. if you believe you have tinnitus start with a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. you may be referred to a hearing specialist. while medication are available to treat tinnitus many people rely on masking devices that sort of "counteract" the interior noise of tinnitus. there's also a new hearing aid available that both amplifies sound and masks the tinnitus noise. wishing you well!

Answer: if you are taking a medication that is not working for you it is not likely that you will need to take it again. it is important to take your medications as directed. if you have a family history of heartburn and are taking medications that are not working you may need to discontinue them. if your doctor has prescribed a medication for you that is causing your heartburn it is recommended that you consult with your doctor before starting any new medications.

================================================================================
Question: can childhood vaccines cause autism?
Answer: there are many causes of autism. one of the most common is a genetic disorder called autosomal recessive disorder (sarcophagus). sarcophagous disorders are caused by a genetic defect in the gene responsible for producing autism. sarcoplasty is a procedure to remove the sclerotic cells that form the sclerosis that causes autism. a person can have autism at any age but it is rare. sclerosis is a condition in which the sids of the sesquiveloid cells (sclerotic sids) are abnormally enlarged. sclerosis can cause symptoms such as: difficulty breathing difficulty swallowing or difficulty speaking. sids are often enlarged in children with autism. autism can also cause scleroid sids. children with sclerosed sids can develop a variety of other conditions. for example: severe headaches. severe pain in the eyes. severe vision problems. severe sinusitis. severe dizziness
Expected Response: there has been ongoing controversy surrounding certain childhood vaccines and their relationship to autism. many studies have looked at whether there is a link between autism and vaccines. to date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism. a suspected link between the measles mumps rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism has been suggested by some parents of children with autism. typically symptoms of autism are first noted by parents as their child begins to have difficulty with delays in speaking after age 1. around this same time the mmr vaccine is first given to children. therefore autism cases with an apparent onset within a few weeks after the mmr vaccination may simply be an unrelated chance occurrence. parents have also questioned whether mercury-containing thimerosal (used as a preservative in vaccines) might cause autism. today with the exception of some influenza vaccines vaccines used in the united states to protect preschool-aged children contain reduced or no thimerosal as a preservative. (influenza vaccine is currently available both with thimerosal as a preservative and preservative-free. ) according to the cdc there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. more importantly studies have not found a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. because the exact cause of autism is not known parents may continue to have concerns despite the evidence. in these cases parents should be aware of the risks of serious disease in children who are not vaccinated. in some areas outbreaks of these dangerous diseases have occurred in people who have not been immunized. understanding the ruling on autism-like symptoms and vaccines in a recent controversy a georgia girl was entitled to compensation after developing autism-like symptoms after receiving five childhood vaccines in 2000. but what does this decision mean to your child and to other children? it's important to note that the government has not said that childhood vaccines actually cause autism. rather the division of vaccine injury compensation (dvic) at the department of health and human services agreed there is a possibility that the vaccines aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder in this young girl. the mitochondrial disorder manifested as a regressive neurological disease with some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. understandably many parents are worried about the risks that are feared to accompany vaccinations. ever since the first vaccines were developed there have been risks. most vaccine side effects are mild and severe ones are extremely rare. but the use of vaccines in children has essentially eradicated a number of major childhood diseases that kill. when parents fail to vaccinate their children the risk of serious -- even deadly -- disease epidemics extends beyond them and their families to their neighborhoods and communities. failure to vaccinate lays the foundation for new epidemics that could result in serious harm to your child. for instance a decline in vaccination rates in some european countries has led to fatal outbreaks of measles. in short whereas advocacy groups against childhood vaccines continue to take issue with immunizations cdc officials maintain that this recent ruling should not be generalized to the risk of vaccines for all children. in a statement the american academy of pediatrics reinforced its dedication to the health of all children and urges parents to fully immunize their children.

Question: what is the prognosis for people with chronic hepatitis c?
Answer: the prognostic value of the disease for people who are infected with the disease is not known. however the prognominational risk for hepatitis c is high. the progenitor of hepatitis c in people with cirrhosis is unknown. in addition the progensitor of cirrhotic hepatitis c may not be present in all people. in some cases the progeny of cirrheic hepatitis c can be inherited from a parent. the risk of cirradosis is also higher in people who have cirrhitis.
Expected Response: in the best case the treatment will achieve a sustained virological response (svr) which means that the hepatitis c virus is not detectable in the blood six months after treatment ends. an svr is the goal of treatment. although the virus is not eradicated its growth is suppressed. the chance of achieving an svr depends mostly on the genotype or strain of the virus. an svr is achieved in approximately 45% of patients with genotype one and between 65% and 75% of patients with genotype two or three. successful treatment should be followed by regular check-ups and a healthy lifestyle. although the overall prognosis for chronic hepatitis c is good some people will progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. a liver transplant may be an option but any replacement liver will also become infected with hepatitis c.

Question: i have 2 month old that has had issues with keeping breast milk and now formula down have done everything doctors say is safe and works well.
Answer: it is safe to use formula with formula. it is also safe to have breast milk with formula as well. i am not sure what you mean by "breast milk" but i am assuming you mean formula that has been removed from the breast. if you are breastfeeding and you have a breast-feeding child i would suggest you consult your pediatrician to see if you can get the formula you are using. if not you can try to get the milk you are drinking from your breast-fed baby. if the formula is still not working you can call your pediatric nurse to see what is going on. you can also try using a lactation pump.
Expected Response: when you say can't keep food down i'm not sure if it is forceful vomiting or frequent spit up. gastro-esophageal reflux (ger when food comes back up is common in babies occurring in half of babies under 6 months old. some are referred to as "happy spitters" meaning they frequently regurgitate (2 or more times per day) but are growing and eating without other issues. but if it gets worse with time or is more projectile or is accompanied by other symptoms (wheezing gagging etc. ) and there is poor growth it's a problem. gastro-esophageal reflux disease (gerd) is ger coupled with problematic symptoms and needs a doctor's attention. if you suspect your child has gerd or some other problem see your doctor again. for more on gerd see this webmd article. you also might want to see a lactation consutant for tips on breastfeeding positions and feeding techniques (like pumping before feeds) to decrease spitting up after feeding. good luck!

Answer: hi if you have any questions ask your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: there is no special chemotherapy diet. but experts say that foods that are spicy or strong smelling are more likely to cause nausea. "ideally i'd like people to eat a healthy diet during chemotherapy so that they get enough vitamins and minerals " says christy russell md chair of the american cancer society breast cancer advisory committee. "any foods that get you through your treatment are probably ok. " you need to stay hydrated. dehydration can interfere with your treatment and has other risks. "if you don't drink enough fluids you can wind up in the emergency room " says carmen escalante md chair of the department of general internal medicine at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center. eating smaller meals more often than you used to may prevent nausea says escalante. although you should never force yourself to eat when you're nauseous russell says that it's important to eat regularly. "never come to get chemotherapy on an empty stomach " says russell. "it just raises the risks that you're going to feel queasy. "

Question: my 2 yr old grandaughter has a small indention an inch above her belly button that hasn't been there until now. she has a few bumps on her abdomen that are not visible. the bumps are small and not very painful. she is having a lot of pain and she is not breathing. she also has a little fever. she was told to stop eating and to eat normally. she went to the doctor and said she has an indention but they said that she needs to be taken to the er. she's been told to eat and not eat.
Answer: hi if your not sure why this is you should get her to a doctor or nurse. but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: unfortunately it's impossible to say what this is without a physical examination. i suggest you take the child to her pediatrician for an exam. it's possible what you're seeing is not so much an indentation as a bulging of the belly button that gives the impression of an indentation above the navel. this could indicate your granddaughter has an umbilical hernia. luckily these are not serious and may not even require treatment. however that's just a wild guess. you should have your granddaughter examined by her pediatrician to find out exactly what's going on. wishing you both all the best!

Expected Response: 13 it’s a great question. the answer is the best doctors will do the right thing. those that aren’t quite at the top of the totem pole won’t. doctors are human beings. we come in all sizes and shapes different motivation. some are driven by excellence and some are driven by their bank accounts. but i would tell you that when you do your homework and you keep your eyes and ears open it kind of all sorts out. the patient who does the homework that asks the right questions that kind of sizes up the practice and acts like a smart consumer just like when you go to buy a car there’s sometimes that you just know you’re getting hustled the observant patient will sense that. how the questions are answered and who answers the questions by the way because some practices employ almost like sales people not physicians to do the what they call selling which is not appropriate in a professional practice in my opinion. this is not like buying an appliance. it is not like buying a car. this is a highly professional service. i think you need to spend time with a doctor not with someone who has no medical education and couldn’t even address those issues safety for example. so i think you need to get a sense of it. i think most people do. i think most people make the right decisions. unfortunately good decisions require work and the rich and famous don’t necessarily make the right decisions either. so it’s not a matter of money or how affluent you are or not being able to purchase because frankly most of the practices are affordable today they really are. for most working people you can afford it. you can finance it you can put it on credit card. but whatever it is that’s not the issue. the issue is making the right decision so that you’ll be happy and of course have a safe experience.

Question: how can thrush be prevented?
Answer: thrush is caused by a virus. it is caused when the body's immune system attacks the virus. thrush can be prevented by avoiding certain foods. avoid foods that contain salmonella bacteria (such as those that contain chicken pox or salmonellosis) and salmonex virus (such: salmoneus salmone) that are not contaminated with salmonea bacteria. avoid products that contain certain types of bacteria such as those used in food-grade foods such as breads and crackers. avoid certain types and quantities of medications such as prescription pain relievers and antifungal drugs. avoid taking certain medications that may cause nausea or vomiting.
Expected Response: the following can help you prevent thrush: follow good oral hygiene practices. brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss at least once a day. avoid mouthwashes or sprays. these products can destroy the normal balance of microorganisms in your mouth. see your dentist regularly. especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures. limit the amount of sugar and yeast-containing foods you eat. foods such as bread beer and wine encourage candida growth. if you smoke quit. ask your doctor or dentist about ways to help you kick the habit.

Question: what is bipolar depressive type? is that a seperate type of bipolar or is that what a doctor calls a depressed episode? . i was released from a psychiatric hospital and in my discharge papers the doctor had written "bipolar depressive type". i had never heard of that before. i was wondering if a depressive type of bipolar actually exists and what that is? is it a subtype of bipolar or did he maybe just not know what to diagnose me as? . thank you!
Answer: bipolar depression is a spectrum disorder. bipolar depression can be severe but not always severe. it is not uncommon for a person with bipolar depression to have several episodes of depression. this is not a "typical" episode. bipolar disorder is not caused by a single disorder. it can be caused by many different things including: a family history of depression anxiety or other mental illnesses. a family member or close relative who has bipolar depression. a parent or sibling who has a family or friends who have bipolar depression or
Expected Response: a depressive type of bipolar disorder has a client who mainly exhibits depressive symptoms. loss of interest sleeping isolatation worthlessness and suicidal thoughts etc. another form would include more manic episodes which include rapid thoughts speaking spending. overlly cheerful optimistic may be mistaken for life of the party. manic phase can also be very productive periods for socially functioning people who are often highly intelligent motivated and don't want meiciation slowing them down. unfortunately highs for some can spike and crash into psychosis sometimes only sometimes violence. over spending into debt other impulse problems rocketing into severe depression. note; there are many varations on cyclic mood dysorders.

Question: my insurance was cancelled due to not able to pay and i now own the insurance co $2000. is there anyway to reduce this. i am a student and missed two payments for my insurance. if i don't have $600 by the end of the month which i probably won't i will have to pay the insurance for the prescriptions it paid for. this will be over $2000 and is an enormous amount for anyone especially a college student. i called the insurance company to see if i could pay the $600 in installments but they said i couldn't. any advice?
Answer: you need to talk to your insurance company. they may be able to help you find a plan that is affordable for you. i suggest you contact your state's health insurance assistance programs to see what they have available.
Expected Response: talk to someone who is in charge at the insurance company. if you don't have the money they are not going to get anything unless they sued you. you are willing to work out a payment plan and i think they would be fools not to accept your offer. don't take the first "no" for an answer. i suggest that you find the name of the head-honcho. the supervisor. and direct a letter to them with your proposal. this is an expensive lesson on the importance of not missing payments.

================================================================================
Question: what are shingles and postherpetic neuralgia?
Answer: shingle and post-herpetics are not related.
Expected Response: shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus the virus that also causes chickenpox. in a person who has been exposed to chickenpox -- or its vaccine -- the virus never really goes away. it can lie dormant in the body's nerves. in most cases it stays that way. but in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. this is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. when it comes back the virus can cause shingles: a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. early shingles symptoms can include: headache light sensitivity flu-like symptoms without fever. itching tingling or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next and the pain can be moderate to severe. are you contagious? though people who haven't had chickenpox can catch that condition from you the shingles itself isn't contagious. for reasons that experts don't really understand the pain of shingles lingers for some. if the pain lasts for at least four months after the shingles rash appeared a person is diagnosed with phn. in some people the pain will subside. in others it won't. "we don't have any idea why the pain goes away in some people and not others " says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y. but the longer you have phn -- especially after a year -- the less likely it is to resolve he says.

Question: i have chronic constipation. my dad wants me to try castor oil. is this something i should do?
Answer: castor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) that is used to treat inflammation. it is a pain reliever and can be taken to relieve constipation and pain. it may be helpful for you to try it. it can also be helpful to try a nonsteroidal-inflammatory cream (nsad). this is a steroid cream that contains an anti-inflammation agent. if you are taking this cream for pain or inflammation you should talk to your doctor about the best way to help you manage your pain.
Expected Response: i know your dad wants to help you but i don’t think this “old remedy” is a good choice. it is important that you work with your doctors trust them and their judgment because the treatment selected depends on the cause of the constipation. it’s work in progress.

Question: i have an ear infection and am having trouble keeping the drops in my ear. they drip out when i sit up. i am using ciprodex ear drops (as well as antibiotics). when i put the drops in my right ear i can't seem to get them in. i can sometimes get 1 drop in out of 4. i lay on my side for about 15 mins but when i sit up i can feel them slowly drip out. i also tried the drops in my uninfected ear no problem going in. is this because of the infection? what can i do?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's a bit of a shock to hear that you're having a problem with your ear. it sounds like you're dealing with an infection. in fact you may be having an ear problem at some point in your life. i'd suggest you get to a doctor and have your ear examined. it could be something as simple as a bacterial
Expected Response: there can be several reasons. since i can't examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the ciprodex (there are several different types of "ear infections") it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason. one reason could be ear canal swelling. in otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut. some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate. other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris. many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will not go in. i would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last.

Question: what kind of doctor do i see for swollen glands under the armpit/very itchy rashes on the swollen glands and groin? . my armpits are so painful that sometimes i put ice packs on them. i have developed very itchy little red bumps under my arms on my inner groin and between my buttocks. all of this is extremely uncomfortable and depressing. i am not sure if i should see a doctor or not.
Answer: i would see a dermatologist. it could be a bacterial infection or a fungus. the rash will go away on its own.
Expected Response: hi if its just lymph glands? then your own doctor should be able to help you. good luck

Question: are people with schizophrenia dangerous to themselves or others?
Answer: many people with psychosis are not at risk for developing schizophrenia. however some people with the disorder may develop schizophrenia because they have been exposed to certain environmental factors such as stress exposure to certain foods or medications. the risk for schizophrenia is greater in people who have schizophrenia than in people without the disorder. people with schizoaffective disorder may have a higher risk for a variety of conditions including: anxiety disorders. people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia are more likely than others to have anxiety disorders such as: substance abuse disorders. substance abuse disorder. substance use disorders are more common in people with a substance abuse problem than in non-drug users. people of any age who have a substance use problem may have more serious problems with substance abuse than people without a substance problem. people may have higher risk of stroke and heart disease if they have a history of heart disease or stroke. people can also have a greater risk of getting stroke if they are
Expected Response: if symptoms are under control and medication regimens are adhered to there is very little chance that a person with schizophrenia will be a threat to themselves or others. moreover most people with schizophrenia are not particularly prone to violence with most preferring to be left alone. if someone with paranoid schizophrenia does become violent it is most often directed at a family member and usually occurs within the home. however people with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for suicide and attempt to take their life more frequently than the general population.

Question: my daughter has crohn's disease. can she take ibuprofen?
Answer: hi if your daughter is on the meds you would need to take her to the doctor for a check up. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you can take acetaminophen (tylenol others) for pain. you will want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin ibuprofen (advil motrin others) or naproxen (aleve). these are likely to make your symptoms worse for crohn's disease. i've had crohns' disease for 50 years. in those days the treatment for chrohns' was primitive. it was first diagnosed in 1942 the year i was borrn. i was in 2nd year medicine at the time & had to take a couple of years out before i could gat back. it was thought to be ulcerative colitis at the time & it was 12 years before we found that the small bowel was affected as well & i required at the time to have 6 ft. of my small bowel removed (no fun). now i can tell you that over the couinter drugs are useless in treating a flare-up. you need an anti-inflammatopry such as prednisone to battle the flare-up. anything less is useless. i advise you to go to your doctor & get a prescritption for prednisone. you start at 8 (5mg. ) tablets the first day. the next day take 7 then 6 etc. you'll probably find that the flare-up will be over in 4 or 5 days & you won't even finish the prescrption. one must be careful with drugs like prednisone; they are steroids & must be used with care. btw i once talked to dr. crohn in a conference call. he was 92 & living in connecticut. i'd strongly advise against taking nsaid's especially is she has ulcers because they can cause ulcers to bleed.

Question: does going outside in 40 degrees after working out & you are still sweating no jacket contribute to catching a cold?
Answer: hi as you have been working out for a while now it would be best you just go to the gym and do some stretching and do a few stretching exercises. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: no it doesn't. colds are caused by a virus. despite what generations of mothers have said you cannot "catch your death of cold" simply by going outside in the cold while wet or sweaty. you catch colds by coming in contact with one of the more than 200 varieties of virus that can cause the symptoms of a common cold. usually rhinovirus is the culprit. you can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands frequently and refraining from touching your eyes or nose. it's not uncommon for a person to touch an object on which the virus has been deposited then transfer the virus from their fingertip to their body by rubbing their eye or picking their nose. hope this helps!

Question: what is this large hard dark lump under the skin of my inner thigh? it doesn't hurt but i've had it for like 3 months? . there's an oval hard lump under my skin on my inner thigh farther back so you can't see it if i'm standing it barely sticks out from my skin but is large like wide and long. the skin above its darker than the skin around it (pretty sure not dermatofibroma) i thoughtfrom shaving or my shorts were too tight &were irritating the skin but i've addressed these &it hasnt goneaway. it's too low to be a swollen lymph node. should it go away on its own time if i use neosporinor should i visit a dr.?
Answer: i would suggest you see a dermatologist for a proper examination.
Expected Response: without the ability to examine this lump first-hand it would be impossible to blindly determine what it is. and it will go away on its own. a description is just not sufficient information to make this important call. yes you most definitely need to see a medical provider in order to get an accurate diagnosis.

Question: i had a ct scan for my lung doctor and was told they seen a mass on the left side of my breast what could this be? . i am a 58 year old women if this is any help to you.
Answer: i would have to see the doctor and have a cbc scan done. it is possible that you are having a cfm but i would suggest that you go to the doctor for a second opinion. the cbc scans are usually done by a c-section specialist.
Expected Response: i don't know. a medical professional would need to see this scan and correlate it with clinical findings (a breast exam). show the scan to your doctor and have him or her render an opinion. not all masses are serious. or cancer so don't be prematurely concerned.

Question: can you get hpv without having intercourse? . i have had hpv for over 10 years. i have never had sex. i've never had a period. i'm not pregnant. i don't have any symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease.
Answer: hi if you have had a sex partner for 10 years then you have got hpv and you are still at risk for it. if you do have sex then you can get it from a condom. if your not pregnant then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: children can get hpv from their mother during a vaginal birth if the mother is infected. hpv on the outside of the skin can be transmitted to others by direct contact during skin-to-skin sexual play. hpv can be contracted from oral sex if one partner has the virus orally. most of the times however hpv that is detected on a woman's cervix has gotten there just one way. through sexual contact.

Question: can i use my hot tub with a poison ivy/oak/sumac rash? (already washed affected area to remove oil residue). currently on day 3 after contracting rash. localized to just my feet & ankles. have already bathed rash to remove oil residue and using hydrocortisone. i have a hot tub and want to use it but am worried about causing a secondary skin reaction or spreading it to my boyfriend in the water.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's always tough to tell the difference between a "cold sore" and a "hot sore. " it's important to keep in mind that you can't "wash" a rash from your body. a rash can be caused by a variety of things including: a skin infection (such as eczema) or an infection that is not caused by the rash itself. even a mild infection can cause a rash to become more prominent and spread to the area around you.
Expected Response: you will not spread poison oak to anyone. the skin lesions are not contagious (assuming they are not secondarily infected). the hot tub will not spread poison oak either but it is possible to contaminate a poorly-sanitized and improperly-brominated hot tub with bacteria. direct contact with your boyfriend could spread a secondary infection but you cannot catch poison oak from someone else. this is a common misconception.

Question: what are kegel exercises?
Answer: kegel exercise is a form of exercise that involves lifting weights or using a variety of weights. the main reason for kegel is that it is very light so it can be done in a few minutes. the most important thing to remember is that you do not have to do kegel every day. you can do kegels with any kind of weight or weight-bearing equipment. kegel exercises can be performed in a variety ways. you may perform kegel with a variety equipment such as a stationary bicycle or a stationary bike rack. kegel can also be performed with a ball or other device that is attached to the body and can be used to lift weights or other objects. keel exercises are also performed with other equipment such a bicycle or other stationary equipment.

Question: how do i prevent and cure scoliosis?
Answer: if you are taking zyrtec you should be taking a combination of zyrcid and metformin. both are safe and effective. if you have any questions about the combination or the metformins you should talk to your doctor.
Expected Response: most helpful answer scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine. in most people the spine naturally curves out a bit near the neck and inward at the lower back (the lumbar region). in people with scoliosis the spine makes an abnormal "s" curve from side-to-side. scoliosis is usually identified in children. when adults get scoliosis it's frequently a result of trauma (accident) osteoporosis (thinning of the bones of the spine) or osteoarthritis. generally speaking it's not possible to prevent scoliosis. to prevent it you would need to know what is causing it. and usually we don't know the cause of scoliosis in a given individual (except as noted above). also there is no "cure" for scoliosis. when scoliosis is symptomatic (meaning it causes pain or problems breathing) it's often treated with a brace or occasionally surgery. if you think you or your child has scoliosis you should be examined by a health care professional. many people misunderstand what scoliosis is exactly and think poor posture or slouching indicate scoliosis when this may not be the case. hope this helps!

Question: i think my urethra ripped open (male). hi. i'm a 15-year old male and i think my urethra ripped open. my glans have been irritable for about the past month or so. it was not until today that i seriously tried looking at my penis to find the issue. it seems my urethra ripped open slightly above where my urine used to come out but that tear isn't healing or closing up. the normal hole is however. i've never masturbated (it's not a moral or religious reason but just a preference) but i have ejaculated while asleep many times. i am not sure if this is a normal reaction or not but i'm not sure what to do.
Answer: hi if you google urethral tears you will find lots of info on this. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer you will need to have your penis examined by a medical professional either your primary care medical provider or a urologist. this is not an er visit but you can go to an urgent care facility. try not to worry. it may not be as serious as it seems but you need to have it properly checked. you will need to inform your parents and/or show this open area to your father. in the meantime until you can see a medical provider keep the area as clean as possible and use some topical antibacterial ointment. i am unclear why you were having irritation a month before this incident but bacterial or yeast infections in this area like balanitis are not uncommon.

Question: can a person go off high blood pressure medication if he looses weight or is this a lifetime medication once started?
Answer: you may not need a lifetime high blood sugar medication. if you are concerned about your blood sugar you may want to talk to your doctor or health care provider about how to manage your blood sugars.
Expected Response: when a person becomes overweight they make it harder for their heart to function. think about it: every pound of extra fat requires extra blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells. as your heart works extra-hard to pump blood through possibly miles of extra blood vessels it can cause high blood pressure. when a person who is overweight loses weight the opposite effect can occur. the fat and extra miles of blood vessels have gone away with the weight loss so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. this can lower blood pressure. so yes if a person is overweight and takes high blood pressure medication they may be able to get themselves off the meds by losing weight. i say "may" because factors other than extra weight may be causing the individual's hypertension problems. if you are overweight and taking medication for high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you begin a weight loss program. that way your healthcare provider can monitor your progress and adjust your medications as you lose weight. no one should ever stop taking a medication like one for high blood pressure on their own. that definitely could have bad consequences. wishing you well!

Question: for the past few days i have been experiencing dizziness and slight pressure in my head is it anxiety related? . i was taking birth control but was having side effects so i stopped a few days ago. my symptoms tend to come and go a lot of the times i notice them when i am at work. when i am home relaxing the symptoms seem to go away. i do worry a lot and wonder if this could be anxiety related (i have been having tests done for possibly a risk of cervical cancer) or possibly still having side effects to my birth control.
Answer: hi i think its just a couple of things it could be stress or just stress and anxiety. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: this could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people. since your symptoms seem to improve when you're not at work and you've only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests i would suspect that anxiety could be the cause. it could also ironically be a side-effect from stopping (or starting) the birth control which can have physical side effects. you can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but i don't think you have too much to worry about.

Expected Response: studies show that the risk of miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks gestation) is 12% to 15% for women in their 20s and rises to about 25% for women at age 40. the increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities contributes to this increased risk of miscarriage in older women.

Question: how do i know how much weight to lift?
Answer: assuming you are healthy and weigh in at a healthy weight you should be able to lift about 5 to 6 pounds. if you are overweight you may need to consider adding more weight to your workout routine. for example if you weigh in between 170 and 180 pounds you may be able lift about 6 to 7 pounds.
Expected Response: when you first begin a strength training routine it’s always best that you start out with a much lower weight than you think necessary and progress until you reach an appropriate level. most people aim for 8-12 or 12-15 repetitions per set but don’t just stop your set because you reached some arbitrary number. it’s important to keep working your muscles until you reach muscular fatigue. if you find that you are doing an excessive amount of repetitions per set then it may be beneficial to increase the weight further to bring that number down to a more manageable number. if you’re doing too few repetitions consider decreasing the weight to bring the number up a bit since it may be too heavy of a weight for you. remember to always reevaluate what you’re doing while strength training. you want to be continually challenging yourself and progressing. try occasionally increasing the weight by small increments adding more repetitions to your set or adding more sets to your workout. if it might help some people will write down and keep a log of the weight number of sets and number of repetitions for each exercise that they do if you can’t recall off the top of your head. trial and error is the way to determine how much weight to lift. select a weight that looks close to what you think you can lift based on your goals. if general conditioning is your goal then select a weight you think you can lift eight to 12 reps (or 12-15 reps for beginners). if you can lift it 25 times with ease then it's too light and if you can lift it only four times then it's too heavy. there are no formulas to calculate this. simply decide what your goal is so you know how many reps to lift take a guess by looking at the weights and then give it a try. you'll get good at this quickly. find the ones you are most comfotable with the more comfortable you get the better they are

Question: what are other things you can do for acne?
Answer: there are many things you could do to help prevent acne. one of the most important is to avoid sun exposure. use a sunscreen that is not tinted. avoid harsh sunscreens that contain harsh ingredients such as retinol and retinyl palmitate. avoid the use of harsh products that contain retinoic acid. avoid products that are made from genetically modified organisms. avoid sunscrub products that use chemicals that are toxic to the skin. avoid sunscreen that contains retinyl propionate or other retinoin products. avoid any products that have a high percentage of retino-glucan in them. avoid using any product that contains salicylic acid or salicyrosin. avoid all products that include retinoisoleic acid or retinyl salicyrolide. avoid those products that may contain retinoids that have been used for years to treat acne.
Expected Response: cosmetics: don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted coverups or even foundation as long at it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). there are many quality products available. facials: while not absolutely essential steaming and "deep-cleaning" pores is useful both alone and in addition to medical treatment especially for people with "whiteheads" or "blackheads. " having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it yourself. pore strips: pharmacies now carry under a variety of brand names strips which you put on your nose forehead chin etc. to "pull out" oil from your pores. these are in effect a do-it-yourself facial. they are inexpensive safe and work reasonably well if used properly. toothpaste? one popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. there is no medical basis for this. ditto for vinegar.

Question: 8 year old stomach pain for 12 days rash off/on vomiting pale face. had urine and bloodtests came back normal. ultrasound of abdomen came back normal. was giving ibuprofen for pain but had been on it for too long monday will be two weeks and shes not getting any better. dr though it was strep and strep rash but that came back negative too. my daughter is miserable and i need advice! shes been to an urgent care center as well.
Answer: hi you should see your doctor and get a blood test done there would be a good chance she is getting some kind of strep. good luck
Expected Response: is she on antibiotics? amoxicillan is an antibiotic that can cause rash. it's not necessarily an allergic rash just a side effect. keep up with the ibuprofen no aspirin. keep her comfy and hydrated not with sugary drinks and juices (which are sugary drinks). water is best if she is not eating try some of the drinks for children that replace electrolytes and have some vitamins. if she has no fever is eating and drinking ok don't get too upset. assuming she has been vaccinated against all the nasty bugs. many things cause rash but be on top of fever rash and stupor (sleepiness confusion). i might want to have blood work to rule out meningitis if she has not been vacinated. viral meningitis can cause rash too but is a milder form of the disease. mono can cause rash and is common with kids.

Question: can i spread herpes to my children? . i just found out that i have herpes type 2 i had a cold sore on my mouth and the doctor thinks i passed it to myself down there. i need to know if there is any possibility at any time to pass it to my children.
Answer: herpes is a virus that can spread through contact with bodily fluids or mucous. if you have had an outbreak of herpes you may have developed an outbreak. if it is in your mouth it is possible to spread it to your children. if the virus is in the throat it is also possible to pass the virus to others. if your child is already infected with the virus you can get it from them.
Expected Response: sadly yes. you can pass herpes type 1 or 2 to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout. when you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine (antiviral drugs) to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels. herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common. there is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively.

Question: how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?
Answer: i don't know what you are talking about but if you are taking diuretics and they are not working for you i would suggest you see your doctor for a referral. i suggest you call your doctor's office to discuss the issue.
Expected Response: first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic ("water pill") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called "loop diuretics"). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!

Question: which cooking oil should a diabetic use?
Answer: the best thing you can do is use a good source of vitamin a. it is important to note that the majority of people with diabetes are not getting enough vitamin a from their diet. so you can safely eat a lot of vegetables and fruits and vegetables that contain vitamin a and avoid foods that contain sugar.
Expected Response: whether you have diabetes or not here are some healthy cooking oils to choose from. choosing the right oil depends on what kind of fat the oil is made with. there are three kinds of fats: saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. saturated fats are butter lard and shortening. they are solid at room temperature and linked with elevated cholesterol levels and increased risk for heart disease. if you have diabetes these should be very limited. polyunsaturated fats are canola oil sunflower oil and walnut oil. they are always liquid even if placed in the fridge. these kinds of fats can improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. monounsaturated fats are olive oil and peanut oil. they are always liquid at room temperature but become semi-solid when placed in the refrigerator. when these are used in place of saturated fats they too can reduce the risk of heart disease. follow this link to find out what the top 3 oil picks are. canola

Answer: you need to see a dermatologist. this is a very serious medical issue. you need a hands-on examination by a dermatologists.
Expected Response: that depends on the extent and location (on the body) of the laceration (a cut) and a skin avulsion (a torn off piece of skin). both can be considered serious and both can be considered minor but unfortunately you did not provide any specific information for any medical provider to answer more definitively.

Question: i'm in my late 50's and have implants. my right breast hurts when touched in one spot. should i be worried? . i have not had any injuries to my breast. i have been having constant pain in my right side. i am a good weight and have been getting better.
Answer: you are not alone. there are many reasons why you may have breast tenderness. some of the reasons may be related to your age or weight. other reasons may include a hormonal imbalance or a change in your diet. you need to see a doctor for a more detailed evaluation.
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it can't hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure. while it's likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else. and that's why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain. as you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue. as time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to "pulling" on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself. and of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer. any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts. if you can't see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider. he or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed. wishing you well!

Expected Response: if this is truly your blood pressure (this actual reading would be very unusual since the top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic) is quite close together) yes i would be concerned. many blood pressure recording devices can give inaccurate readings so please take your blood pressure more often or better yet see a medical provider so that you can be properly evaluated.

Question: why am i always thirsty?
Answer: yes. it's important to drink plenty of fluids when you exercise. if you're not exercising regularly you should drink plenty. if your exercise is strenuous you may need to drink more fluids to keep your blood pressure up. if that's not enough fluids you may want to drink a variety of fluids such as water and electrolyte drinks. if the fluids you drink are not helping you drink more fluid you may also want to limit your exercise. you may be able to drink water more often if you exercise more often. if this is not helping your exercise you may not need to exercise at all. if exercise is not working for you you drink plenty if you enjoy exercising. if it's not working you may have trouble getting enough fluids. if exercising is not making you feel better you may consider drinking more fluids.
Expected Response: excessive thirst is hard to define. people normally drink varying amounts of liquid depending on their activity level and the temperature indoors and out. there are two main medical conditions that should be considered if you feel constantly thirsty: diabetes mellitus: the common form of diabetes in which high blood sugar levels spill into the urine increasing urine flow. the excessive urination leads to dehydration causing the person to become thirsty and drink more fluid. diabetes insipidus: an uncommon problem in which a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (adh) is either low absent or not functioning properly. adh normally acts on the kidneys to cause them to retain water. in diabetes insipidus the lack of normal adh function results in high urine flow a constant feeling of thirst and high fluid intake. your doctor can test you for these conditions over one or two office visits.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a serious problem. you need to see your medical provider. he or she can help you determine what's causing the spur and determine if it's a bone sprain. the sprain is caused by a nerve pathway that connects the bone to the nerve roots. the spur is located in the middle of the spine. it's not painful. it can be painful enough to cause pain. if you're concerned about the spurs you should see a doctor. you can also get a bone density test to see if you have osteoarthritis. this is a test that measures
Expected Response: the only definitive treatment for a persistent bone spur would be surgery or at least a custom-made orthotic from a podiatrist. i am not sure what kind of steroids you are using (injections? ) but they will not cure a bone spurt. steroid injections can help the inflammation caused by the bone spurs but the effect is only temporary. steroids will not make a bone spur grow.

Answer: the new guidelines will not affect screening mammograms performed on people with pre-existing conditions. the new recommendations will not change the way mammograms are performed.

Question: why can't i use condoms as birth control after an endometrial ablation? . my obgyn says no and i either my husband or myself must have sterilization. i am just wondering why condoms cannot be used.
Answer: hi ok its a good question to ask your obgyn and he or she may be able to help you with that. good luck
Expected Response: hi after doing some research for you found this on acog. org. pregnancy is not likely after ablation but it can happen. if it does the risk of miscarriage and other problems are greatly increased. if a woman still wants to become pregnant she should not have this procedure. women who have endometrial ablation should use birth control until after menopause. sterilization may be a good option to prevent pregnancy after ablation. a woman who has had ablation still has all her reproductive organs. routine cervical cancer screening and pelvic exams are still needed. the problem with condoms is the can break this will increase the chance of getting pregnant which as you have read is not good for you. so its toss a coin time who goes for the op would be best as i can see and makes sense. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: took a dose of 50mcg levothyroxine can this cause harm? . should i be concerned since it is a natural hormone produced? effects if any it may cause?
Answer: levothyroid is an anti-inflammatory hormone. it is not a hormone that can be taken in the same way as ibuprofen or naproxen. it can be used to treat many conditions including high blood pressure. however it is important to note that levothyrozide is not an antibiotic. it does not cause any of the side effects that are associated with taking it.
Expected Response: the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of "natural supplement" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single 50mcg dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information.

Question: are dentures worn 24 hours a day?
Answer: i would suggest that you see a dentist to get a better understanding of your dental history. you can do that by going to dental hygienist. dental hygiene is a very important part of any dental health plan.
Expected Response: your dentist or prosthodontist will instruct you as to how long to wear your denture and when to remove it. during the first several days after receiving your denture you may be asked to wear it all the time including while you sleep. although this may be temporarily uncomfortable it is the quickest way to identify the areas on your denture that may need adjustment. once adjustments are made you should remove your dentures before going to bed. this allows gum tissues to rest and allows normal stimulation and cleansing by the tongue and saliva. the denture can be put back in your mouth in the morning.

Question: what kind of skin condition/infection is this? . yesterday an apparent skin infection on my check had swollen half of my face and made it extremely sensitive and sore. i seemed to have brought it down with ibuprofen and ice but the size of the actual bump has not diminished and still hurts. the bump itself looks like a raised inflamed elliptical area slightly over one inch long. the area feels mostly hard underneath while the skin above it feels very dry. what would cause this and should i see a doctor?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're having a skin infection. i'd suggest you see a dermatologist for a proper examination. there's no way to diagnose a skin condition without a physical exam. it's possible you're experiencing a mild case of psoriasis (a skin condition that's caused by an infection of the skin called dermatitis). psorias are very common in children and adults. they're

Question: i love oatmeal and i am a diabetic. is it good to eat in a regular basis? . the issue is that i read that some doctors say that oatmeal is alright but you must be careful with it as a major part of your diet but others say it is fine as long as it is not loaded up with all the "nice" things that make oatmeal so good like brown sugar and raisans which makes sense because of the high carbo content. i am not sure if i am right or wrong but i am wondering if it is ok to eat oatmeal daily.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss your concerns. it's important to note that oat-containing foods like breads and cereals can contain some calories and other nutrients. i suggest you check out this article that you can read about oatmeal. it covers a wide range of foods and beverages that can be loaded
Expected Response: most helpful answer the key for diabetes is keeping carbohydrate intake consistent throughout the day. oatmeal is a healthy carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for heart health and can fit in a healthy diet. you want to work with your healthcare provider on how many carbohydrates you need in a day. the american diabetes association recommends 45-60 grams of carbohydrate at a meal (3-4 carbohydrate servings). one half cup of oatmeal without added sugars contains about one carbohydrate serving (15 grams). if you add to tablespoons raisins that is another carbohydrate serving. the benefit of carbohydrate counting is you have flexibility about what you eat as long as you stay within your recommended carbohydrate intake. but choosing carbohydrates that are nutritous like oatmeal (and other whole grains) fruits and dairy is important for a healthy diet. if you need help see a diabetes educator for more assistance. for more information on carb counting see this article <link> i am a type 2diabetic and eat oats every morning. one of the first things i was taught was to add a good fat or protein to a carb breakfast. i eat 1/3rd cup of steel cut organic oats cooked in water 6 oz. of almond milk 1tsp cinnimon and 1 tbs. of almond butter. i also eat one cup of fruit but eat the fruit 1hr prior to the oats. this wait time allows the fruit to digest before the oats start to digest. i have been taught also to not eat a startch or grain carb together with a fruit as the stomach treats this combination by frementation during digestion. my blood sugars are norml eating this way. total carbs for this meal is around 66grams which is high but eating this way negates the high blood sugars!

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm glad you're doing this. there are many things you can do to prevent heart disease and stroke. the best thing you can hope for is that you stop taking this drug. if you do stop taking it you will likely end up with a heart attack or stroke. if your doctor or nurse prescribes it for you then you should be able to take it. if it's not
Expected Response: i applaud your attitude to this dangerous drug. i would suggest you do a lot of research on the subject. dr. duane graveline's book 'lipitor thief of memory' is a good start: www. spacedoc. com there are a lot of links to other doctors surgeons and researchers who are skeptical of statins.

Question: missed the 6th pill in birth control pack? odds of becoming pregnant? . i began my newest pack of birth control on sunday my husband and i had sex tuesday night. i forgot to take friday's pill so i took two on saturday morning. if i wasn't on any type of birth control i would probably ovulate sometime between that saturday and this thursday. i hear that sperm can live between 3 to 7 days. what would the odds be that i would become pregnant. i have been on the same birth control (aviane) for a little over 2 years and have taken them consisently without forgetting. i don't know if i would be pregnant or not.
Answer: hi first you have to take your pill on the first day of your next period then you should be ok. good luck

Question: i'm sure i have strep throat i'm allergic to penicillins and i think i'm getting better. do i really need meds? . on tuesday afternoon i had a tickle in my throat. w/in 3 hours i had a severe sore throat a fever no energy and swollen nodes the next day. i had white patches on my tonsils but today there is only 1 tiny one left. i haven't had a fever for a day and half i have more energy and feel a little better. do i really need antibiotics (i'm allergic to penicillin anyway) if it seems like i'm fighting it off? i know there can be complications but they're rare and i don't think i'm an "at risk" person. i'm just wondering if i should get a prescription for a blood test for strep?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. you're probably not allergic to any of the penicil-containing medications
Expected Response: waiting a few days makes sense. a few extra days of employing home remedies should not increase your chances of a complication occurring. i suggest drinking plenty of fluids frequent gargling use throat lozenges to soothe a sore throat sleep with a humidifier and take otc analgesics for discomfort. here are a few additional points: - eventually i recommend that you talk w/your physician about the allergy to penicillin. many folks mistakenly think that they are allergic to penicillin when in actually they were never allergic to this agent or the allergy has worn off. i remember reading that only 20% of individuals with a verified penicillin allergy continued to have a negative reaction after the passage of 10 years from the last dosage taken; - years ago doctors would culture the throat & would have to wait days for sensitivity results in determining if a patient had strep throat and the appropriate antibiotic that would be needed. today in the physician's office a patient can know the results through a swab of the throat and a 10 minute wait period. it may be a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor or medical clinic. that way your throat can be viewed by a medical professional a diagnostic determination probably made on the spot and you can discuss the possibly that you may not be allergic to penicillin. feel better soon.

Answer: you will need to call the pharmacist who will be handling your refill. you can also call the pharmacy that filled the refill to find out if they are willing to pay the full price for your medication.
Expected Response: it's unlikely your insurance plan will cover the cost of the same prescription in two places within the same general time frame. if you have some other type of pharmacy discount card however you may use that to pay for one of the prescriptions as long as it isn't at all connected with your insurance plan. but it's always best to check with your insurance policy to confirm the specific rules of your plan.

Expected Response: it is the antibiotic and usually not yogurt that causes those gi disturbances. some yogurts contain beneficial bacteria. beneficial bacteria in yogurt may be listed on the package with such names as acidophilus thermophilus streptococcus bifidus bulgaricus or lactobacillus. these bacteria may actually help to reduce the negative gi symptoms from the antibiotic. look for those ingredients on your yogurt container even when not taking an antibiotic to ensure that you receive positive probiotic bacteria. many of the leading brands of yogurts contain these beneficial bacteria. if necessary ask your grocery store dairy manager or the pharmacist for assistance in selecting a yogurt with positive bacteria.

Answer: deafness is a common condition in people with osteoarthropathy. it can occur in people who have osteoarsingitis (osteoarthrosis) or other conditions that cause a person to have a low bone density. it is also common in people whose immune system attacks bone marrow. it may be difficult to diagnose deafness in a blind person.
Expected Response: only if the arthritis is the middle ear bones so most of the time time deafness is unrelated to osteoarthritis (also called degenerative arthritis). the only commonality among both deafness and osteoarthritis would be advancing age. no. osteoarthritis and deafness are aging related disorders. both can appear simultaneously and can be considered related to each other. osteoarthritis of middle ear bone may lead to deafness.

Question: what medication can be used for minor throat and chest pain following endoscopy?
Answer: no. there are no medications that can be prescribed for throat and throat pain.
Expected Response: the type of pain you describe certainly is common after endoscopy and i'm sorry you're experiencing it. generally speaking throat lozenges or any kind of hard candy (sugar-free if you have diabetes) can soothe the irritation of the throat after endoscopy. you also may use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (tylenol) ibuprofen (motrin advil) or naproxyn (aleve). keep in mind ibuprofen and naproxyn are blood thinners that can promote bleeding so you may want to avoid those for a few days after your endoscopy. also if you take acetaminophen be sure to follow the label instructions. taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. do not exceed the maximum daily dose. hope this helps!

Question: after taking antibiotic for pneumonia my son is still coughing. is that normal? . he's also still on an antibiotic for an ear infection. will the additional antibiotic help with the cough or will it have to run its course?
Answer: hi he has a cough that's been going on for a couple of weeks now he is now coughing up a lot of mucus and he's not breathing at all. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: an antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection. however the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time. if it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month i would ask the md. also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough. coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better night's rest for him if he can not cough so much at night. also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the "junk" that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out. i wouldn't worry too much at this point.

Question: what is the treatment for shingles?
Answer: the treatment of shingling is very different than the treatment in other areas of the body. the treatment is different than in other parts of the world because the immune system is different. the immune systems are different because they are more active in areas where the virus is present. the vaccine is the vaccine that protects against shingle.
Expected Response: the severity and duration of an attack of shingles can be significantly reduced by immediate treatment with antiviral drugs which include acyclovir valcyclovir or famcyclovir. antiviral drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. other treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include steroids antidepressants anticonvulsants and topical agents.

Answer: you will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: other than plastic surgery there is no medical way to increase the size of your penis. or your feet. or your head. or any other part of your body. it is what it is so don't waste your money on quackery. an artist is not judged by the size of his paint brush and a good lover is not judged by the size of his penis.

Question: what are the odds of having a partial hysterectomy and then getting pregnant? . this situation was presented to me by a friend 40 year old woman hx of partial hysterectomy suddenly finds out she is 12 to 16 weeks pregnant but never knew. states there is a heartbeat and its a girl. next day she goes to the dr and finds out she lost the baby. there were no previous complaints of pain and or bleeding. how likely do you think this story is?
Answer: hi the odds are very good you will have a hystrectomy but your still a boy. good luck
Expected Response: it depends on what she considers a "partial" hysterectomy. if she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero. based on the detail of this story i would seriously doubt its validity. another question the person who presented me the story is very distraught over his gf losing this baby they even named her. he was not present for any appts has not seen any labs or ultrasound pic even though she states she had an ultrasound and has seen no positive pregnancy test basically he is going on her word. i hate seeing him hurting like this and the circumstances surrounding are very suspicious. he says she has 2 small incisions one by her bellybutton and one on her left side. is there medical documentation or anything he could ask for to prove her story?

Question: post stent lifestyle reccomendations none have been given to me. after having two stents implanted i was put on appropriate meds as to my individual situation but was never informed as to what lifestyle changes i should do to lessen the chances of further complications i. e. diet exersise etc. is this normal these days?
Answer: hi have a good read through this link from www.healthwise. com. it may help you. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: the whole idea of having heart stents done is to allow you to lead a full and active life. it is very common for patients who have had heart surgery to be afraid to engage in normal activities. one excellent way to get back into an exercise program is through cardiac rehabilitation. cardiac rehab as it is often called is a customized program of exercise and education. many programs involve not only monitored exercise but also provide nutritional counseling emotional support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems. if cardiac rehab is not appropriate or possible then discuss your specific exercise goals with your doctor. physical activity is so important for your wellbeing. a physical exercise program should incorporate 4 basic types of exercises. the exercises should include: aerobic exercise muscle strengthening flexibility and balance. an adult should spend at least 30 minutes in aerobic exercise on five or more days of the week. but this is a minimum amount and more is definitely better. the good news is that is doesn’t have to be done all at once. three 10 minute walks are just as good as one 30 minutes walk. depending on your other health issues you will want to pick an aerobic exercise that doesn’t cause problems elsewhere in your body such as your joints. that is why swimming bike riding and walking work better for many adults rather than running. weight lifting is another important part of an exercise program. woman especially benefit by weight training in maintaining strong bones. yoga is a wonderful way to work on flexibility and balance. yoga not only helps with these elements it can reduce your stress levels. but research has shown that exercising alone can’t wipe out the damage done if you sit all day long. humans were not designed to be as sedentary as modern life now dictates. it is important to move throughout the day to be really healthy. obviously diet and weight are also key elements in your recovery from cardiac stent surgery. consulting with a dietician is very helpful in learning to eat healthy. keeping a diary of all the foods that you eat for 3 days or more can also be enlightening. taking off those extra pounds if you are overweight and watching your cholesterol intake needs to be on your program. we know from research studies on obese patients who were at risk for diabetes that losing 5% to 7% of their total body weight delayed and possibly prevented diabetes. diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease as is high blood pressure and small amounts of weight loss can significantly improve your health. you don’t have to look like a model to be healthy. so ask your doctor for specific recommendations to help you on your way to a healthier lifestyle.

Question: what is the first trimester (week 1 - week 12) of pregnancy? . i am not pregnant yet but i am worried that i might be pregnant. i have had unprotected sex 3 days before my period. i am also having cramps and i have been having cramping and cramping in my lower abdomen. i also have a small amount of spotting.
Answer: hi if you think you are pregnant then go see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: during the first trimester your body undergoes many changes. hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. these changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. other changes may include: extreme tiredness. tender swollen breasts. your nipples might also stick out. upset stomach with or without throwing up (morning sickness). cravings or distaste for certain foods. mood swings. constipation (trouble having bowel movements). need to pass urine more often. headache. heartburn. weight gain or loss. as your body changes you might need to make changes to your daily routine such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent small meals. fortunately most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. and some women might not feel any discomfort at all! if you have been pregnant before you might feel differently this time around. just as each woman is different so is each pregnancy.

Question: could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy? . this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat. but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position. in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease (<link> <link> ). can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful?
Answer: i am not a medical professional but i am a bit confused about this. the americans heart association (a. s. ) has a good article on the topic. <link>.
Expected Response: most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease.

Answer: hi your find it is a very odd problem. if you have been told that your ovaries are not producing enough hormones then that is a good sign. but if you are having symptoms of depression or anxiety then you may want to see your doctor. good luck

Question: i tried to push out a mole that was in my skin and now its popping out how do i natural make it go back the way it was? . i tried using a lotion but it was too thick and it is still there. i also tried using some oil and it just goes away.
Answer: it's important to make sure you are using the correct moisturizer. it can be difficult to tell if you are moisturizing with the wrong product or not. i would suggest you see your dermatologist for a proper evaluation.
Expected Response: if you disrupted the skin by trying to squeeze a presumed mole out of the tissue there really is no way to make it go back in. i suggest you keep an eye on this to make sure you don't now develop a skin infection. if you experience localized redness heat swelling or pain or if you develop a fever you should seek medical attention. for future reference it's not a good idea to try to remove skin lesions yourself. never pop pimples "dig out" lesions with a knife or squeeze growths on the skin. for one thing you don't necessarily know for sure what they are. for example what you think is a mole could be a skin cancer. pulling it out of the skin could appear to remove the lesion but cancerous cells not visible to the naked eye could remain behind and delay your getting treatment. hope this helps!

Answer: if you have a cold and you are taking a different medication than the one you are using you should be fine. it is not possible to determine the exact cause of your cold without a physical examination. it would be best to see your primary health care provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

Question: what causes bleeding in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy?
Answer: most helpful answer this is a very common problem. there are many reasons for this. the most common is a bacterial infection. this can be caused by bacteria that live in the vaginal area. these bacteria can live in a variety of areas such as the vagina or anus. the vaginal lining of the vagina is usually very smooth and it is very easy to bleed. the bleeding can be due to a variety reasons. for example a woman may have a yeast infection. a woman can have a vaginal yeast infection even if she has no symptoms. a vaginal infection can also be caused from a yeast virus. a yeast disease can also cause a vaginal discharge. a women may have an infection of the vaginal opening. this is called a vaginal cyst. a cyst can be a small hard tissue cyst or a cystic cyst (a cyst is a small cyst). cysts are tiny cysts that are
Expected Response: abnormal bleeding in late pregnancy may be more serious because it can signal a problem with the mother or baby. call your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any bleeding in your second or third trimester. possible causes of bleeding in late pregnancy include: placenta previa. this condition occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the opening of the birth canal. although placenta previa is very rare occurring in only one in 200 pregnancies it is an emergency requiring immediate medical attention. bleeding from placenta previa can often occur without any pain. placental abruption. in about 1% of pregnancies the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during labor and blood pools between the placenta and uterus. placental abruption can be very dangerous to both the mother and baby. other symptoms of placental abruption are abdominal pain clots from the vagina tender uterus and back pain. uterine rupture. in rare cases a scar from a previous c-section can tear open during pregnancy. uterine rupture can be life-threatening and requires an emergency c-section. other symptoms of uterine rupture are pain and tenderness in the abdomen. vasa previa. in this very rare condition the developing baby's blood vessels in the umbilical cord or placenta cross the opening to the birth canal. vasa previa can be very dangerous to the baby because the blood vessels can tear open causing the baby to bleed severely and lose oxygen. other symptoms of vasa previa include abnormal fetal heart rate and excessive bleeding. premature labor. vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy may just be a sign that your body is getting ready to deliver. a few days or weeks before labor begins the mucus plug that covers the opening of the uterus will pass out of the vagina and it will usually have small amounts of blood in it (this is known as "bloody show"). if bleeding and symptoms of labor begin before the 37th week of pregnancy contact your doctor right away because you might be in preterm labor. other symptoms of preterm labor include contractions vaginal discharge abdominal pressure and ache in the lower back. additional causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are: injury to the cervix or vagina polyps cancer.

Question: do penile pumps work?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's not uncommon for a man to have a penile pump. but it's important to note that the penile pumping is a very individual process. it can take many different types of pumps to achieve the same result. if you're having a problem with your penis pump it's time to see a medical professional or a urologist for an examination. you may want to consider a penis health regimen. if your penis is sensitive to touch and you have a problem getting it out of your penis it's best to get it checked out by a medical provider.
Expected Response: penile pumps and there’s mechanical devices that you can use those are all good for erection. and they work great. before the days of viagra that was a common operation if a guy had diabetes or a prior pelvic surgery and he couldn’t get an erection and injections didn’t work we had amazing results with penile implants whether inflatable or mechanical. and almost all the men who had those implants were thrilled with them. in the old days you had about one out of a hundred would break and you’d have to go back and fix it. either the pump would go bad or a line would erode or something would go wrong or leak. the newer advances in products are so much better. they not only increase they not only fill length but fill girth and they are far more reliable with rare risks of complications. but with the advent of these new medications out now most men don’t need that. there’s still a need for it and there’s still experts around the world that specialize in that and get great results. but that doesn’t change the length or the width of the penis. it just simply restores the ability for rigidity.

================================================================================
Question: are antibiotics safe during pregnancy?
Answer: there are no safe antibiotics for pregnant women. there is no evidence that a pregnant woman should use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) during pregnancy. however if you have a history of breast cancer and breast cancer is suspected use a breast-feeding baby.
Expected Response: certain classes of antibiotics are safe. and when you go visit your doctor they are fully aware of what classes you can be on. if you have any questions though when you come and drop off your prescription make sure you talk to the pharmacist. will be able to double check that information for you if the doctor may have prescribed an antibiotic that maybe you are allergic to when he didn't realize that either. let us know because we'll be more than happy to call them inform them and possibly get the prescription changed to something else.

Question: i have been thinking about buying drugs online to save money is that a good idea?
Answer: it sounds like you are. there are a number of different types of drugs available online that can be used for pain relief. some of these drugs are called "steroids. " some are called pain relievers. and some are actually prescription drugs. if you are a regular user of any of these medications you will likely be able to find them at a drug store or pharmacy. but you will need to check with your doctor before you start shopping.
Expected Response: i would advice this patient that they need to just go proceed with caution. we are finding out that lot of online pharmacies actually take drugs from other countries and send them overseas. so we can't guarantee the products that you get through the internet are really what you think you are getting. so it could be kind of big problem in a small package. so i would highly recommend that if you are going to -- basically what are prescription medications over the internet or through mail-order go through major companies based in united states these are also chains that have stores. we could actually walk into a store and get a prescription refilled and you want to be able to talk a pharmacist you know when you are doing with online you are not going to be able to talk to anybody if you have a question about is it going to interact with my medicine? it's actually a little bit risky. so patients need to understand that the pharmacist is a key person that they need to make sure as part of their healthcare routine the internet is free for some things but not for medications.

Question: nausea vomiting constipation pain in right side of stomach diabetic low grade fever. my fiance has been in the hospital for over a week now. they have done multiple tests and come up with nothing. these are his symptoms: nausea vomiting constipation pain in his lower right side occasional hiccups and low grade fever. he is also diabetic. he goes back and forth everyday. one day he is terribly sick then the next just fine. they have done an endoscopy upper gi small bowel and hida scan. they only thing they have found is gastritis. what could possibly be wrong with him?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best with this! i'm not sure what type of gallstones you're referring to but i'd suggest you get a blood test done to rule out diabetes. i'm sure you'll be fine. you can also get a colonoscopy done to check for gallstones. i hope
Expected Response: the symptoms also resemble gallbladder kidney or bladder stones; however these should have already been ruled out with a cat scan. my mother (diabetic) experienced something as that which lasted quiet awhile she lost a significant amount of weight during her sickness. doctors were also stunned and diagnosed something as gastritis. researching the web of her symptoms i found that she was probably experiencing an inflammation of the outer lining of her stomach. she was given antibiotics from her doctor which was appropriate however i advised a change in diet until better. her symptoms lasted for several months. the nausea prevented her from eating as she should resulting in a unhealthy weak appearance. there was significant sporadic work loss during that time. antibiotics were prescribed at least twice as i remember. the one thing i have learned of the medical field is that they are forever making mistakes and usually it is good to rely on your own thoughts and those of family and friends. never ever hesitate to get a second or third opinion. if your doctor is located in a small town seek out a professional in the closest large city as the state capital or one of it's size. it seems the most knowledgeable and creative doctors practice in larger cities. one last thought. not knowing more information the thought of an appendix problem popped to mind.

Question: what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?
Answer: there are a number of factors that can cause malnutrition in people with ulcers. some of these include: being overweight or obese. being at higher risk for disease such as cirrhosis or cancer. being overweight. being pregnant. being older than age 60. being on medications for ulceration. being diagnosed with ulcodymia (infection of the colon with a bacteria called ciprofloxacin) or ciprodilone (a drug that causes a buildup of fluid in the colon). being overweight can also affect how well you can digest foods and drink. for more information on these factors see the ulcer disease section of this topic.
Expected Response: one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.

Answer: hi its from the uk's nhs and you should be ok if you have a blood test done then yes you should have a positive test. good luck
Expected Response: oxycontin is an opiate (derived from the opium plant). morphine is an opiate as well. the test that you took may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between these two opioid compounds. i have read in other sites that these 2 medications have the same properties. oxy often shows up as morphine. i am very lucky that my dr. told me that the test that they are made to do in the dr. office are often incorrect. if my dr. is knows the patient well he will not dismiss someone based on the urine test. these often show up as other drugs. good luck.

Question: lortab makes my stomach hurt and me itch. percocet didn't give me the same problems. what is the difference? . percocoet is a drug that is used to treat pain and inflammation. it is also used to relieve the symptoms of arthritis. it works by blocking the receptors that make pain and swelling in the stomach. it also helps to relieve constipation and diarrhea. i am not sure if it is the same drug as percotet or not.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're experiencing some sort of allergy. it's important to know that percote is not a cure for a common cold. it can cause a variety of other conditions including allergies and many other conditions. it may also cause you to have a rash or a yeast infection. it could also cause a yeast allergy. however it's not likely you'll need to take this medication for a variety other conditions such as allergies or
Expected Response: lorcet contains a different pain medication than percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the lorcet. stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food (more of a meal rather than some crackers). i would suggest that you talk to your health care provider about your reaction to lorcet and also let your pharmacist know. they can put a note in your profile about this reaction.

Question: does being hungry all the time subside after a month or two of being pregnant?
Answer: hi i think you should find out what your problem is. it is not just your body that is causing you to be hungry. the problem is that it is your body's way of making you feel hungry. if you are not hungry you can be getting a lot of things wrong with you. but you can try a lot more foods like fruit vegetables whole grains and whole grains. you can also try some foods that are high in sugar and high in saturated fat. these foods can help to lower your hunger. but don't be afraid to try some other things like green tea and green tea powder. these are all good things to try. good luck
Expected Response: while everybody is different that constant hunger that occurs the first few months of pregnancy usually subsides by the second trimester. while appetite is still robust the second trimester it can be satisfied with balanced meals and regular intervals of eating. typically by the end of the third and last trimester appetite decreases as the baby tends to push on the stomach causing early fullness. for more on eating right during pregnancy see this webmd article. congratulations on your pregnancy!

Question: can chiropractic care reverse osteoporosis or scoliosis?
Answer: you can get a referral to a specialist for a referral.
Expected Response: most helpful answer in my opinion chiropractic adjustments will have little or no curative effect on either of these conditions. a child or teenager with scoliosis should be carefully evaluated and monitored by a specialist. a person with osteoporosis should be under the care of her primary care medical provider or orthopedist. this is kind of a "loaded" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find "specialists" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that.

Question: how soon after eating something sweet does it affect your blood sugar level?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's really important to know that sugar is a chemical that is produced by the body. in fact many foods that are high in sugar are high-sugar foods. for instance some foods like eggs are high sugar but some foods are high fat and some foods that have a lot of sugar are low fat and are high cholesterol. the key is to avoid foods that contain high amounts of sugar such as those that contain sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas and other sodas. also avoid foods with high amounts such as chocolate and sweets. foods high in saturated fats such as margarine and margarine-containing foods such as bacon and pork products are also high in cholesterol. i suggest you speak to your health-care professional about what foods you should avoid. there are some foods you can avoid including: fruit and vegetables such as applesauce bananas bananas
Expected Response: within minutes.

Question: how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?
Answer: osteo-arthritis is a chronic condition that affects about 10% of the population. it is caused by a combination of nerve and muscle damage. the disease can be caused by many conditions but osteo is the most common. in most cases it is not related to a disease. however osteo can cause joint pain and swelling of the joints. it can also cause a range of other conditions. in some cases it may cause joint swelling. in other cases it can cause pain and stiffness of the muscles of the feet. osteo may also cause joint inflammation.
Expected Response: there is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis. x-rays of the affected joints can suggest osteoarthritis. the common x-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones and bone spur formation. simple x-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist in decision making as to when surgical intervention should be considered. arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. during arthrocentesis a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout infection and other causes of arthritis. removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain swelling and inflammation. arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. if successful patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. finally a careful analysis of the location duration and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. therefore the presence of heberden's nodes bouchard's nodes and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best! i hope you feel better soon! i'm not sure if you're aware that smoking is linked to a number of health issues including heart disease and cancer. i'd suggest you see a registered dietitian. you can find one
Expected Response: i used to smoke a similar amount and would often get pains in my chest on a morning sometimes lasting for a couple of hours. i used to worry about them quite a lot so i quit smoking to see if it would relieve them. the first couple of weeks after quitting the pains got worse but then stopped completely. i've never experienced them since. i'm not a doctor though so i can't say that you are experiencing the same thing as me. but it certainly sounds similar

Question: does a high ths level mean your thyroid is too fast or too slow? . i have graves disease and had my thyroid ablated (i believe that is the correct term) with radioactive liquid. i take sythroid 0. 15mg currently but have had trouble keeping good levels. i have also had high blood pressure. i am not sure if this is a thyroid problem or not. i would need to see a doctor asap.

Question: is it normal for my 2 yr old to scream and cry when i or anyone sings? . on her second birthday i was holding her and i and everyone else was singing happy birthday and she started crying and screaming and slaped me and said no no stop.
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know what kind of child this is. it is not normal for a toddler to cry when she is playing. i am not sure what type of child you are but if she is not crying then you should not be doing this. it sounds like she is crying because she is getting ready for her birthday.
Expected Response: if it is like my family she may be objecting to bad voices but i suspect she just has sensitive hearing and the combined singing voices were just more than she could handle. i don't think it will always be like that for future birthday celebrations.

Question: can i take a claritin d after i have taken excedrin migrane?
Answer: claritins are used to treat a variety of conditions. the most common cause of a severe allergic reaction is an allergic reaction to an antibiotic such as claritinoin. the reason that you may have a severe reaction to a medication is because it contains an antibiotic. a severe allergy reaction is caused by a chemical reaction in the body. a chemical response is a reaction that occurs when the body's immune system attacks an antibiotic that is in the drug's active ingredient. for example if you have a very severe allergic response to an antihistamine such as the claritinosin d you may experience a severe response to a drug that is not in the active ingredient such as a clarithromycin d. if you are taking a clarin d that is made with a different ingredient you may also experience a reaction to the drug. if your doctor prescribes a different medication for you ask your

Question: are fillers and botox safe to use during pregnancy?
Answer: botox is a very effective treatment for many conditions including allergies asthma and allergies. it is also used to treat the common cold and flu.
Expected Response: injectable filling material such as juvéderm restylane radiance and artefill typically do not enter the circulation and therefore it would not appear to be dangerous during pregnancy. understand that the fillers and the wrinkle-softeners botox and dysport are all degraded or metabolized by the body and their end products would not be expected to be injurious any more than any other medication that the mother may be taking. however i am just against any non-essential service being rendered to a patient during pregnancy. in medicine we don’t have 100% certainty as to all the interactions between drugs and the body. so why take the chance?

Question: what's less damaging: smoking 3 cigarettes per day or picking two days of the week and smoking 10 on each of those days? . i know that light smoking still poses significant risks; i know i can still get cancer one day from doing it. so please don't answer by telling me that. i'm looking to significantly cut down in order to lessen the damage i'm doing to myself while still indulging a little in one of my favorite activities. so here are my two options: a) smoke about 3 cigs/day (about 20/week) or b) pick 2 nights/week say two nights when i'm out socializing and smoke about 10 on each of those (about 20/week)? i'm not sure if that's a good idea or not but i'm willing to bet that you'll be fine.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i hope you feel better soon! i wish you all the best with this! i hope
Expected Response: i wish i could give you a good answer but i don't think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level. in healthcare we measure smoking by the "pack/year. " we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked. for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a "20 pack/year" history. a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week (which calculates to roughly 0. 15 pack per day) for 20 years would have a roughly "3 pack/year" history -- the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years. regardless of the manner in which you smoke (a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period) you're probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures. intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time. rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in. you sound well-informed about the risks of smoking so i'll leave you with one little tidbit. did you know one of the more-common cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer (especially in men)? so the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when you'll be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh. if not then you might want to re-think the whole smoking thing. wishing you well! i wish i could give you a good answer but i don't think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level. in healthcare we measure smoking by the "pack/year.

Question: what dosage of oil of oregano should be given to a 12 month old baby with asthma?
Answer: it is best to talk to your doctor about the dosage of any medicine you are taking. there are no specific dosages for an asthma medication but it is important to know that you are not taking any medicine that contains any antibiotic.

Question: my 3month old has little cradle cap on her forehead but i notice that its discoloring her skin when some flakes fall off. i need to know will her skin go back to normal or shell have discolor skin forever?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i hope you're feeling better soon! it sounds like you're dealing with a very serious skin problem. i'd suggest you see a dermatologist -- someone who can examine your skin and perhaps examine your baby. if you're concerned about discoloration in your baby's skin it's probably best to see a pediatrician -- someone that can examine you and perhaps have you evaluated by a dermatological professional.
Expected Response: cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis) will self-resolve in time and should not leave any permanent skin discoloration.

Question: i have all the symptoms of hypothyrodisim and it runs in my family but i also have very tender breasts. is that normal? . they hurt most of the time. i also do have a lump were my thyroid gland is. i am very worried about my thyroid.
Answer: hi its a good question but if you think your not pregnant then its a great time to get to your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: if you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldn't be a bad idea to get checked out. if you do have hypothyroidism you should be treated for it. breast tenderness generally isn't considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances. some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or menopause and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time. so it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they aren't necessarily in a clinical sense. your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland. hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better. best to you!

Question: what is delirium?
Answer: deliria is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks a foreign substance. this is called an immune response. the body may fight off the infection by blocking the virus from entering the body. the immune system also attacks other parts of the body such as the eyes kidneys and the heart.
Expected Response: delirium is a form of altered consciousness that occurs in people with medical illnesses or who have dementia. in delirium the person’s level of consciousness and understanding of her surroundings rises and falls. she may be lucid and appropriate for part of the day but be confused and disoriented at other times. people who are delirious may be lethargic and “out of it ” agitated and aggressive or somewhere in between. delirium most often affects older adults and children. infections and medications are probably the most common causes of delirium. people with dementia are more likely to become delirious. treating the underlying cause (such as an infection) is the most important treatment for delirium. antipsychotic medications can be used to treat delirium. re-orienting and comforting a delirious person is also often helpful and may reduce the need for antipsychotic medication.

Question: does flexeril cause a fast heart rate?

Question: got surgery to remove ingrown toenail & it is looking better; but the area & underneath are turning a brownish color. i am 20 years old & had been dealing with an infected ingrown toenail for a few months. i got surgery to remove the side of the nail a few days ago & it is looking better; however the area & underneath my nail are turning a brownish color. is it infected again or is this part of the healing process or something else entirely?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a very serious infection. i'd suggest you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you may need to see a plastic surgeon to remove this part. there's no way to blindly guess at the reason behind your condition without a hands-on examination. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: as you may know the internet poses an obvious barrier when trying to make a blind diagnostic decision without the ability to examine your toe first-hand. i have removed zillions of toenails in my medical career and yes you can have some areas under the remaining nail turn brownish. this is usually older blood that is being reabsorbed by the body. if your toe is red hot and tender then these would be a sign of an infection. when in doubt it is perfectly fine to contact the medical provider that performed this procedure for post-surgical advice.

Answer: the bedbug population is very small. it is not a common pest and is more common in rural areas. bedbugs are attracted to people who are in close proximity to them. it may be difficult to distinguish bedbug from other bedbugs because of their small size. bed bugs are attracted by the smell of urine and feces. bedbug infestations are more common than other bed bugs in the united states. bed bug infestation rates vary widely. some people are more likely to be infested by bedbugs than others. bedbabies are more vulnerable to bedbugs. bed bursitis is a sexually transmitted disease that causes bed bugs to bite humans. bed-babies can be sexually transmitted (sti) if they are sexually active. bed bedbug bites are more painful than other bites. bedtime bites are less common than bedbugs but are more difficult to treat. bedfever bites are usually mild and do not
Expected Response: no. bedbugs are equal opportunity biters -- they’ll go after you whether you are dirty or clean.

Question: can amoxicillin be used to treat bacterial vaginosis?
Answer: it is not recommended to use antibiotics for bacterial vagitis.
Expected Response: no that is not the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis. it would not be likely to help. i am assuming that you are self-treating perhaps using a medication left over from a previous prescription or someone else's meds. if this is the case i would not recommend that you do this. if you want to your vaginitis properly treated it would be best to consult your medical provider so that you can use the right prescription.

Question: wake up with severe nausea and stomach cramps. after having a large unfirm bm the nausea and cramps stop. what is it? . about once a year i get woken up in the middle of the night with severe nausea and stomach cramps. i have to sit on the toilet for hours before any form of relief in the form of a bowel movement comes. the bowel movement is typically large and unfirm (but not diarrhea). once this happens the nausea and stomach cramps stop. i go back to sleep and then get woken up again but it's less severe. the second bm is usually diarrhea. and then i'm better. i'm on no medication. what gives?
Answer: the cause of your nausea and vomiting is unknown. it is possible that you have a yeast infection. it may be that you are taking a drug that may be causing your nausea. if you are not taking any medication it is unlikely that you would be experiencing any symptoms of this
Expected Response: sounds like typical diarrhea to me. you should maybe revel in the fact that it's just once a year? you might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things. if it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor.

Question: i had a cold sore once. can this be passed on to my grandchildren if they kiss me or drink or eat after me? . a few times in y 64 yrs when i have had a cold sore. can i pass this to my grandchildren by kissing or letting them drink after me. my physician said i would have to have an outbreak for the children to catch it from me. my daughter doesn't believe it and the babies are always wanting to kiss grammie please help as i feel like they will be fine i kissed my own babies (5 of them) they drank after me no one ever got a cold sore.
Answer: hi if you have a cold or sore in your throat it is not the virus but rather the mucus in the throat. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: i agree with your doctor. herpes simplex (cold sores) are typically only contagious and transmitted during a active outbreak. since millions of people on this planet have latent herpes virus in their system those children will be eventually exposed by someone. a classmate or day-care cohort. most likely sometime in their lives. should they get it it will not likely be from a loving grandmother who just wants to kiss her grandchildren. new parents are worried about everything but this is one virus that is unlikely to come from you. about 50% of the people who get one cold sore will never get another the rest of their lives so should we advise they never to kiss another person? most people like you can have periodic outbreaks but the infrequency of your events show that you have an excellent immune system that is suppressing this virus. my advice for you is to kiss those grandchildren when you do not have an outbreak and my advice for your daughter is to "get real". a grandmother's love cures more boo-boos and i suspect your kisses will be risk-free.

Question: we are planning to attend disney world on vacation. my granddaughter is only 9 months - what are the risks of measles? . she will be flying and attending disney world one day. is this not advisable?
Answer: measles is not contagious. it is not a contagious disease. it does not cause fever or runny nose or run down the throat. it only causes the body to produce antibodies that fight off the virus.
Expected Response: your unimmunized child is at risk for measles in any crowd not just disneyland or disney world. she will likely be fine if you do not allow anyone to touch her in the stroller or play with other children. kids like to touch things so if you allow her to touch benches handles etc. places where other children have touched you need to carefully wash or sanitize her hands. you can also wait for disney world until the recent measles epidemic has abated but as far as i know most of the cases are in california (disneyland) not in florida. i don't know when you are planning this trip but you can always check with the local health authorities to see if there are any restrictions or recommendations at the time.

Question: miscarriage at 21 weeks and symptoms after. i had my miscarriage last week wednesday/thursday when i was 21. 5 weeks. i started lactating on sunday. it's now wednesday and it's still going. i am wearing the tightest sports bras i own. does anyone have any insight on how long this will last for? the doctor just told me it would happen but nothing else. . also how long till my uterus fully contracts and my stomach goes back to what it used to be? i'm not sure how long i'll be pregnant.
Answer: hi ok ok so you have been having a miscarriage and your period is around 20 days then you should be ok then you could be pregnant then. but your getting a lot of problems with your periods and your periods are not as good as you think. ok good luck
Expected Response: you should stop lactating in 1-2 weeks. continue to wear tight fitting bras and avoid any breast or nipple stimulation. medications to "dry" your milk up are not typically recommended. your uterus will return to normal size within approximately 6 weeks.

Question: are federal government employees eligible for cobra benefits when employment ends?
Answer: cobra is a federal program that covers people with incomes up to about $46 000 per year. cobra will not affect your income.
Expected Response: federal employees are not eligible for cobra benefits but they are eligible for a benefit that functions similarly called temporary continuation of coverage (tcc). as is the case with cobra you will be able to continue her current health benefits for up to 18 months (assuming you're leaving voluntarily. involuntary separation from a federal job generally disqualifies you from being tcc eligible). you'll be responsible for paying the full cost of your health plan (your portion and the government's) plus a 2% administrative fee. you can see what those rates will amount to by checking the health premiums page on the u. s. office of personnel management website. to get the ball rolling you will need to fill out and submit to your human resources office a form (2809) for tcc enrollment. you can find the form at: www. opm. gov. you should submit paper work within 31 days from your final day of work but no later than 60 days after your job ends. if you miss the deadline you'll miss out on the opportunity to elect tcc. it's important to note that there is a 31-day extension period after your final day of work when health benefits will still be available to you at no cost. on the 32nd day after regular coverage comes to an end you'll have to begin paying your premium.

Question: most of my bowel movements are hard pebbles most of the time i use a rubber glove on my hand to get the stool out why. i eat a lot of fiber and have used senocot and miralax without much relief i also have pain in my groin area that affects my walking sometimes. i have been having this problem for a few years i also have gerd and take protonics for that. what can i do?
Answer: hi if you have a problem with your bowel movements then you could try this but do not try to get rid of them. just try to find the right exercises for you. good luck
Expected Response: i certainly think you should see a doctor about this. what you're describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass. this possibly could cause a bowel obstruction eventually. it sounds like you've done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives. you should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay well-hydrated. some medications for acid reflux can cause constipation so be aware of that. your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if there's something else going on. either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements. best wishes to you! i have not experienced what you are going through. but i did have anal fissures leading to bleeding. also hard stools. here is what worked for me: i have boiled okra regularly for dinner as part of my diet. spinach (indian recipie for plain palak) 1 apple a day dried prunes in office for munching (about 5 to 6). atleast two liters of water every day almond oil with warm(or hot for me) milk after dinner. and important: walking 30 mins a day if possible before the first visit to the toilet int he morning. i never buy ebooks but i bought this one and some of them helped me: <link> ebook pdf is called: constipation help i'm not saying this will cure your condition which looks a bit further away from where i was. but these things in my diet helped me. from what i experienced once you have this situation its better to see what foods you eat and make a regular schedule. disclaimer: i only told what i faced and how it helped me. im not a docotr and have no medical knowledge. i also cut out coffee entirely from my diet. hotchoclate. for me. those led to hard stools
================================================================================
Question: could there be a connection between pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis?
Answer: it is not likely. a person with osteoporososis is at higher risk for osteoporefractic fractures. however it is also possible that certain medications may increase bone density. for example aspirin may increase the risk of osteopontosis.
Expected Response: both pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis cause brittle bones. however pycnodysostosis is a disease with abnormally dense bones whereas osteoporosis is exactly the opposite a disease with washed-out porous bones. there would seem to be no conceivable connection between pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis. the new findings about cathepsin k and pycnodysostosis have made it clear that cathepsin k is a major protease in bone resorption. given this function it may well have a role in osteoporosis. cathepsin k may in fact provide a rational basis for a new approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. this is an excellent illustration of how research on a rare disease may bring benefits to those affected by a common disease.

Question: can you wrap poison ivy in gauze so not to spread. its on both arms and its hard to not touch it on things can it be wrapped at night while i sleep and for how long can it be wrapped?
Answer: you can wrap poison oak in gauzy gauze and not spread it. it is very important that you wash your hands frequently. you will need to see your doctor as soon as possible to make sure that you are not spreading poison oak.
Expected Response: poison ivy on the skin is not contagious. it will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person. it can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later. assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead. it is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions. it does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained.

Question: just began tamiflu-current fever 103. 5. 10yr old. acetaminaphin ok? (tested positive with nose swab)
Answer: hi if you have tamiflucan you should get this checked out by your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: i am not a doctor but having raised four kids and now my eight year old grandson i may be able to guess an answer here. if i remember correctly any time a fever is over 101. 0 the body needs help to fight the fever. anything under that number you usually want the body to fight it off itself. it is a very good idea to give acetaminaphin espically if the fever is that high. you can give tylenol. and three hours later give advil . and so on. good luck.

Question: right now i have no insurance and patient assistance pays for my 388. 00 a month medication. how much will i have to pay for it on the silver plan?
Answer: if you are covered by medicare you will have to buy a plan through your state's exchange. if you buy a silver plan you will need to pay the full cost of the plan you buy. if your state does not expand medicare coverage you will not be required to pay a penalty for not paying the full costs of the coverage you purchase.
Expected Response: you may be able to continue getting assistance with your medications. the law won't stop prescription drug programs. however all health plans sold through the marketplaces must cover the cost of prescriptions. and if your income qualifies you for subsidies you may find that a big chunk of the cost of your medication is covered through the plans available to you. the only way to know for certain is to shop your options. in new york the online marketplace is called new york state of health. here's the link to the website where you can begin to compare health plans: <link>
================================================================================
Question: if i took pseudoephedrine for what i thought was a sinus headache can i take acetaminophen too?
Answer: you can take pseudoephenaline (acetaminophen) for a sinuses headache but you need to be careful not to exceed the recommended dosages. you can also take ibuprofen (tylenol) for pain but you should not exceed the dosages for acetaminopa (tyloxacin) or ibuprophen (tylonol) as they are both pain relievers.
Expected Response: yes it is fine to take both acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine together in fact that may be very helpful for a sinus headache. hope you feel better soon!

Question: what's wrong with me? . i go to sleep at about 10 each night and it doesn't matter how much i eat during the day when i wake up from sleep the next morning at around 6-7 am i'm starving to death it feels like. i eat several meals during the day and i have lost 30 lbs since this has been going on during the last 3 months. it makes me feel so puny and weak and most of the time nauseous and i have actually vomited from it is couple times from it. what is going on with me?
Answer: i have a lot of questions and i am going to try to answer them all in one place. i am a very active person and i do not eat or drink. i have tried to eat more than anything and i was wondering if i could have a better answer. i think the best answer is to eat a healthy balanced diet. it is very important to eat well balanced meals and snacks that you can eat at
Expected Response: hi i would start with your doctor explain all your symptoms and ask for help with your problem its from tests that should get to the bottom of your problem. its something we cant really do on here. good luck
================================================================================
Question: how come when i do cocaine smoke smell bothers me. my friends and parents smoke and it doesn't seem to bother me as soon as i do cocaine and smell cocaine i throw up. why?
Answer: it sounds like you are taking a drug test. it is not a sign of a drug problem but it could be a sign that you are addicted to something. if you are using cocaine you may have a tolerance to it. you may also be taking an anti-depressant like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. these medications may help you regulate your body and make it more sensitive to the effects of cocaine.
Expected Response: in my opinion it may be because cocaine screws up the membranes in your nostrils. sorta like if you burn your tongue on soup or whatever your sense of taste is temporarily just not there.

Question: how can i overcome feeling so nervous when i play my flute in band? . there's this one song that we play in band and the flutes have a huge solo in it where we're the only ones with the melody. everytime i even. think. about playing that part in the song i flip out. when we play it in band i shake so bad my notes come out shaky i get sweaty my heart beats very fast and i can barely play because i am so nervous. this happens all the time even if it's just a really short section of playing. last time we played it i got so nervous i almot got up and walked away.
Answer: hi you need to have a good read through this link from the uk's nhs it may help you. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. stage fright can be a terrible thing! first i want to point out that even though you feel extremely anxious the fact is you are playing the song. sure your notes might be a bit shaky -- but you're probably the only person who notices that. you should give yourself a pat on the back for getting through the performance and have confidence in your ability to do this. if it helps at all please know that many famous performers confess to having stage fright. in fact the hugely successful singer adele recently said she often feels "scared (i'm) not going to be able to deliver. " i doubt your performance anxiety requires medical treatment. if possible talk to your music teacher or your fellow performers about this. i bet you'll find they also feel nervous about performing. sometimes just knowing you're not alone is helpful. best wishes to you and remember you can do it!

Question: can my girlfriend get pregnant if she is 26 days on birth control and on day 1 (of 7 days) of her period? . we had unprotected sex and we are pretty worried. i came inside of her and she tried pushing as much of it out as possible and i wiped a lot of it off with a tissue. she has been taking birth control every single day within 30 minutes of 10:00 pm and we want to know the probability of her getting pregnant.
Answer: hi ok so she is on the bc pill and she has not had unprotected unprotected sex yet and she is not pregnant. so yes she could get pregnant. but if she had unprotected intercourse then she could have gotten pregnant. she could be on bc pills for the last few months but not the bc pills. but then you can just take a day off of bc and then you could get a bc pill. but you can take a week off bc and get pregnant but you cant take a pill for a week and then

Answer: i think you will be able for now to find a plan that will cover you. you will need to contact your state's marketplace to find out if you are eligible for a subsidy.
Expected Response: for those concerned about maternity benefits including labor and delivery most health plans will have to cover these benefits beginning in 2014. the one exception is if your coverage is through a "grandfathered" employer plan. some of those plans may not have to add new coverage for labor and delivery right away.

Question: can methadone be transmitted thru sperm or sexual intercourse or sweating to other people?
Answer: hi if you have had sex with someone who has methadones then yes that is the way it is. but if you are having unprotected sex and you have not had sex for at least 2 weeks then yes you can get methadon from someone who is taking it. but you would need to see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: the short answer is: no it can't. if i understand your question correctly you're asking if the drug methadone can be transmitted through bodily fluids from a person who has taken it to a person who has not taken it. this is not possible. in fact it's not possible with any drug whatsoever. in other words you can't get high from methadone or develop an addiction to methadone by having sex with someone who takes the medication. i hope that clears things up for you.

Question: my gf's period is late over 10 days now. we did have unsafe sex after foreplay like 3 mins and wear condom. pregnant? . i was on birth control and i was worried that i might be pregnant. i was scared that i was pregnant. my gf said that she had unprotected sex with me but we did not have sex. i didn't know what to think and i started bleeding a lot. i'm scared that she may be pregnant or something. i started feeling a lot of pain in my lower abdomen and i feel like i might have been pregnant.
Answer: hi ok ok good luck
Expected Response: two weeks before her due date is her most fertile time. foreplay would have caused arousal for you and there would be leakage of pre-ejaculate. those 3 unprotected minutes could have released small drops of sperm before you put the condom on. my verdict is - she's most likely pregnant.

Question: can you tell me whether environmental facial damage can be repaired without doing laser treatments?
Answer: environmental facial injuries can be treated with laser treatments. there are no specific procedures that can be done to repair facial facial injuries without using lasers.
Expected Response: skin damage that is secondary to environmental changes -- such as from the sun or harsh weather conditions -- can be treated with topical tretinoin alpha-hydroxy acid (aha) or glycolic acid and hydrating compounds. severe conditions will dehydrate your skin cells and rob your skin of essential nutritional elements. in order to combat theses unwanted changes your skin care regimen should be designed to rejuvenate rehydrate and stimulate new healthy skin growth.

Expected Response: hi if you uti went away without drugs then that was a good thing but your strong smelling urine may just be from not drinking enough through the day along with what your drinking daily try drinking a two litre bottle of spring water daily this should help flush you system out and flush away you smelling urine. good luck
================================================================================
Question: will clindamycin hcl treat a bladder infection?
Answer: the answer is yes. clindamivir is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it is a combination of ibuprofen (fenco) and naproxen (fenvir). it works by blocking the production of a small amount of inflammation in the lining of the bladder. it is also used to treat bladder infections. it works in combination with other medications to help prevent or treat bladder infection. it also works in conjunction with other medicines to help reduce the risk of infection.
Expected Response: if you're thinking about self-medicating don't do it. have you been diagnosed with a "bladder infection " or did you self-diagnose this? if a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection. as you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections. an antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected. when a person decides to self-diagnose and self-medicate they do themselves a grave disservice. in taking a "leftover" antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment. this can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications. if you believe you have a urinary tract infection (much more likely than a "bladder" infection) i suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center. they will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic. many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a uti or bladder infection. even if you'd had a uti before do not assume you "know" that's what's causing your symptoms. only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract. wishing you well!

Question: it it typical for knee pain and swelling to be associated with strep throat? . i have had strep for about 6 months. i am not sure what to do to treat this. i have been taking ibuprofen for over a year and have been having no symptoms. i'm not sure if it's a side effect or not. i would suggest you see your doctor for a blood test to see if there is a connection.
Answer: hi just google strep and strep you will find lots of info there but its not just strep. strep is caused by bacteria that live in your mouth and this can lead to inflammation and even death. strepsis is caused when a person's immune system attacks the bacteria that cause strep (such as the bacteria in the mouth). strep can also be caused by viruses or bacteria that can live in the blood. if you have strep then you have a very bad case of strep that can lead you to other
Expected Response: most helpful answer no. it is not typical. strep has the potential to cause rheumatic fever including joint infection so i would strongly suggest that you contact your medical provider regarding these new symptoms.

Question: what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?
Answer: the risk of colorection is very small. about one in 10 americans will have a colorecidal disease. the risk is much higher in women than in men. the risks are higher in people who have had colorections before. the link between colorecolitis and cancer is unclear. some studies have shown that colorective diseases may be associated with increased risk for colitis. in addition to colorecal disease the risk for colon cancer is higher among women than among men.
Expected Response: regular physical activity protects against crc. we can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against crc. statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect crc in a positive way. postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the women’s health initiative study to reduce the incidence of crc. dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin b6 all have positive effects in reducing crc. and non-herbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against crc. antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. but the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant. drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a person’s life risk for colorectal cancer. if a person’s body mass index (bmi) is over 25 there is a 1. 5 fold increase in their risk. researchers also noted an increase in incidence of crc and death from crc if a person smoked. and in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics the risk of crc was 30% higher for the diabetic group. another factor that increases a person’s risk for crc is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease. inflammation throughout the gi tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against crc. finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor. if you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance.

Question: why do i have an extreme urge to have a bowel movement when i am faced with scary/fearful situations? . (e. g). imminent danger fear for a loved one misplaced keys etc. or even loud phones in my house.
Answer: hi ok good luck
Expected Response: i can't really answer that question as to why you do this since each persons' response to danger or scary situations would be different. some people scream. some faint. you take the chance of soiling your pants. what concerns me is this reaction when you hear a loud phone or misplace your keys. this is not normal so i strongly suggest that you see your medical provider first to make sure there is nothing physically wrong and then see a good counselor to help you better control this reaction. in the meantime it would be wise to avoid these stressful situations

Question: my cat's claw got stuck in my upper lip and caused an infection. how can i get rid of the round pinkish scar?
Answer: you can try using a saline solution to help with the pain. you can also try using an antibiotic cream or topical medication.
Expected Response: the development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cat's claw pierced the skin of your upper lip. unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same. with time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable. one thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin e-based oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar. if it really is a problem you'll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options.

Question: is it harmful for a female to become extremely sexually aroused if she cannot reach orgasm due to medications?
Answer: hi it would depend on the type of medication you are taking. if you are on a steroid meds this could be the reason for this. but if you have a steroid you could try getting a blood test done to see if it is normal. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i would say no it's generally not harmful to become sexually aroused without orgasm. many woman have trouble reaching orgasm even those who take no medications at all. i'm not actually aware of any medications that block female orgasm so i wouldn't be too sure your inability to climax is related to a particular medication. of course if you have a heart condition you should be cleared by your physician for sexual activity. sexual arousal can raise blood pressure which can be bad for your heart if you have existing heart disease. if you have concerns about your sexual health please do not be reluctant to discuss them with your health care provider or a counselor with expertise in these issues. i can assure you any health care professional worth his or her salt will treat your concerns and questions with the respect and dignity they deserve. hope this helps!

Question: if i take tylenol pm and tylenol arthritis pain am i taking too much? what is the limit for acetaminophen each day?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. tylenols are a common pain reliever. they're a pain reliever that can be used for pain in the joints. but they're also a pain killer. they can cause serious side effects. it's important to take your medication at the right dosage. acetaminopropyl is an antihistamine and is used to treat a variety of conditions. it may be used to relieve pain in a number of conditions such as arthritis. it can also be used in combination with other medications to help relieve pain. if you're taking tylenoacetate or tylenosilicate it's best to talk to your pharmacist or health-care professional before starting any new medication.
Expected Response: recently there has not been a new limit established. we are still using the guidelines of 4000 milligrams a day if you are an adult and 2000 milligrams for an elderly adult. now tylenol pm does contain some tylenol and it contains also benadryl to help you sleep. arthritis tylenol i believe has a higher amount of tylenol so you want to be really careful about how many times you take it a day. come and talk to your pharmacist. we will be able to sit down with you and discuss how many milligrams you might be taking with the one product and then in the evening product the tylenol pm. and figure out how much you are taking on a daily basis. we might ask you to take not as much of the tylenol arthritis product because you are hitting that limit each day. so be really careful come and talk to the pharmacist bring your list of medications because you may not have been aware that some of the prescription medications that you are on may also contain tylenol. that is the reason why it's been in the news because people were taking prescription medication that contained tylenol along with additional over-the-counter tylenol products. so basically come and ask the pharmacist is the medication expert we are a resource for you and we are here to help you.

Question: can i give my 2-year-old children's benadryl and robitussin cough syrup together?
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know. but i think it would be wise to discuss the situation with your pediatrician. it may be best to discuss this with your pharmacist or other health care provider. i would suggest that you consult your pediatric provider about using benadrate or robitus in your child’s cough syrup. it is not recommended that you use benadrine or robital in your children’ cough syrup because it can cause severe side effects.
Expected Response: children’s benadryl contains diphenhydramine and is labeled for use for children aged 6 and older. children’s robitussin is available in a variety of different formulations but may contain guaifenesin dextromethorphan and/or phenylephrine. children’s robitussin is labeled for use for children aged 4 and older (and in some products aged 6 and older). while it is safe to take both the children’s benadryl and children’s robitussin together i would not recommend these products for your child based on her age.

Question: does vitamin c help colds?
Answer: vitamin c is a vitamin that is found in many foods and is important for healthy immune systems. it is also found in vitamin c-fortified foods such as breads and cereals. it has been shown to help reduce the risk of developing colds.
Expected Response: the jury is out on whether vitamin c can prevent a cold. and according to the latest research vitamin c doesn’t make a cold shorter or less severe. although experts do not recommend upping your dosage for that purpose some say it may help ward off germs if you’ve been exposed to physical or environmental stress -- for example with especially strenuous exercise or exposure to bitter cold weather. even so some people swear by it. “i have some vitamin c in my diet every day but i bump the dose up when i get sick ” says lauren richter do assistant professor of family and community medicine at the university of maryland center for integrative medicine. “generally it will reduce the length of the symptoms by at least a day or two and also will help with the severity ” she says. an extra 500 milligrams a day is about all you need.

Answer: you can try a few things to help your baby. try to eat a few small bites of food that you can eat at the table and then when your child is hungry try to grab a few more bites of cereal or fruit. try a small snack that you eat at a table and sit on the edge of the table. try eating a snack that is easy to eat and that is a little smaller than the size of a grain of rice. try not to over-eat. try some food that is easier to eat but not as hard to eat. try something that is smaller than a grain. try putting a small piece of food on the floor so that it is on the bottom of the bowl. try placing a small spoonful of cereal on the table or put some food
Expected Response: good. a "spoiled child" if there is such a thing is a child that is taken care of very well. you don't need to worry about comments others may make about his/her behavior. allow the child to grow and mature. you will have plenty of time and opportunity to encourage self-reliance. right now at age six month they need the parent. a lot. this is not spoiling.

Question: i am a 20-year-old male. what sort of multivitamin or mineral tablet should i take?
Answer: multivitamins are not recommended for older adults. they are not effective in older adults but they are recommended for people over 65. multivamins are designed to help you lose weight and improve your health. they do not contain vitamin c or folic acid. they also do not help prevent or treat high blood pressure or diabetes. multibitamins contain vitamins that are needed to help build bones and help prevent heart disease. if you are taking multivits or supplements for your age or if you have questions about how to take them please contact your health-care provider.

Question: my doctor says i'm obese. are diet pills a good option?
Answer: diet pills are not a good choice for people with diabetes. they can cause some side effects like weight gain and weight loss. however diet pills do have some benefits. they are usually more effective than diet pills. if you are overweight and have diabetes you should be able to eat more healthy foods. if your doctor doesn't approve diet pills for you he or she may recommend a different type of diet pill. if that doesn't work you can always try a different diet pill or try a diet pill with a different filling.
Expected Response: i have to talk to a lot of patients about weight loss. one of the things that i will ask them is did the doctor go over what their bmi or body mass index is. that gives us an idea of really how obese they might be and then incorporate lifestyle changes first. so many times we think of a pill as an instant quick fix. and that's really not the answer. i'll ask patients how active they are and are they incorporating some type of exercise into their daily routine. simple things like walking can really help reduce weight and make you feel better. you should be walking at least 10 000 steps a day and to help you track that you can actually buy a pedometer in almost any store today. they're pretty inexpensive they are under about $20 and you can actually track your progress through a diary and feel good. also making changes to your diet that can include decreasing the amount of fatty foods that you have making more healthier options. try these options first before you go down the path to medication. there is one over-the-counter medication approved by the fda to help people lose weight and it's called alli or orlistat. orlistat helps people lose weight by blocking some of the fat they eat from being absorbed. even though orlistat is available over-the-counter it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you take it.

Question: is it wise to use a nebulizer for nasal congestion? . i have had a nasal congestion for about a year now and it has gotten worse. i have tried using a nebula and a nasal spray but it has not helped. i am taking a nasal sprayer and it is not helping. i also have a cough and it keeps getting worse.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. nasal congestion is not a medical emergency but it can be very uncomfortable. it can also be very unpleasant. the best thing you can do is to see a medical professional. you may want to see your primary care provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you can also take ibuprofen to help relieve the pain. you might also consider taking a trip to a health care provider for a checkup. it may be helpful to discuss the pros and cons of using a nasal drip nasal spray or nasal spray that is not nebulizing.
Expected Response: nebulizers are used to deliver vapors to the lungs. nebulizers are also used to help deliver asthmatic medications to the lungs for infants and other patients that have a difficult time using inhalers with spacers. the medications used are not for nasal congestion but for asthma. nasal congestion medications should not be poured into the nebulizers without supervision or recommendation form you health- care provider. check with your health-care providers prior to doing so.

Question: safest carotid blockage removal procedure?
Answer: i think it is safe to use a carotil blockage procedure. the blockage is removed by a small needle. the procedure is very simple. you just cut a piece of skin off of the block and use a small knife to cut it off. the skin is then removed and the skin will be completely removed. the surgeon then uses a small bandage to remove the block. you can see the results of this procedure in the video below.
Expected Response: the safest and preferred method is usually inserting a stint assuming this an option based on the severity and location of your stenosis. my best friend is getting this done soon as well. the procedure is minimally-invasive relative fast and the outcome tends to be excellent.

Question: is there a safe dosage of benadryl i can give my 5-month-old baby who is battling a very congested nose?
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know the dosage of any benadrozole. it is not likely that your child would be able to get the proper dosage of this medication. i would advise you to call your pediatrician for an evaluation.
Expected Response: this is a good question because benadryl is not a nasal decongestant and will do nothing for the stuffy nose (not to mention this medication should not be given to a child this young. ) you want to use saline drops to help thin out the mucus in the nose and then use a nasal aspirator to help clear the passageway. i also recommend running a vaporizer in the baby's bedroom -- that usually helps a lot as well for congestion. parents need to be very careful about cough and cold medications in infants and children so take the time to talk to your pharmacist.
================================================================================
Question: what is present in semen after a man has had a vasectomy? . if a man is taking medication how much if any of the medication would be present in his semen?
Answer: the answer is yes. semen contains a number of substances that can be toxic to the body. some of these substances can be harmful to the sperm. in addition some of them can be very harmful to your health. if you have any questions about the possible effects of medication on your health talk to your medical provider.
Expected Response: everything but the sperm (hopefully). semen is from the prostate gland; sperm is from testicles so you will still have a normal ejaculation but without any microscopic sperm.
================================================================================
Question: i have itching and discomfort around the anal opening. i don't have hemroids. i can't seem to rid of the problem?
Answer: i would suggest you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: there are many things that can cause an itchy anal area so your first step is to be properly examined and diagnosed. not wiping carefully after a bowel movement can result in irritation and this irritation can itch. soap residuals after bathing laundry detergents or perfumed dryer softener sheets can cause a chemical reaction around the anus. minor skin infections or anal fissures (tiny cracks in the skin) can itch. and finally if you have close association with children pinworms are notorious for causing an itchy bottom. pinworms typically come out at night. each of these would have an individual treatment so having a correct diagnosis first is essential even if you are not enthusiastic about having your medical provider examine this area.
================================================================================

Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent?
Answer: there are many different types of cancer. some cancers can be treated differently depending on the type of cancer and how it is treated. some types of cancers can also be treated at the same time. in some cases it is important to have a physical exam to determine the cancer's cause. in other cases it may be important to see a doctor or a family doctor to rule out other possible causes of cancer such as a family history of colon cancer or other cancer.
Expected Response: tests to help your doctor see if colorectal cancer has metastasized or recurred include: an abdominal ultrasound to find the cause of pain or swelling in your abdomen. a colonoscopy to see if cancer has returned to your intestine. blood tests to find out if cancer has returned ( cea ) or to find the cause of symptoms such as weakness fatigue fever bruising or weight loss ( complete blood count and blood profile ). a chest x-ray to find the cause of symptoms such as persistent coughing coughing up blood chest pain or difficult breathing. a ct scan mri or pet scan to see if colorectal cancer has spread into the chest or organs in the abdomen or pelvis. a brain ct scan or mri to look into symptoms such as confusion paralysis numbness vision problems vertigo or headaches. a biopsy such as a liver biopsy or a lung biopsy to find out where the cancer cells have spread. a bone scan to find out whether cancer cells have spread to the bones. what to think about colorectal cancer often comes back even after successful treatment. if you had colorectal cancer in the past pay close attention to your body and see your doctor regularly. tell your doctor about any changes such as decreased appetite bloating or an increase in the size of your belly. your cancer may return even if you do everything you can to prevent it. if this happens focus on what you and your doctor can do to treat your symptoms to help you feel better and live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what is the difference between novolog 70/30 and novolin 70/30 insulins>?
Answer: yes the difference is in the amount of caffeine. the combination of novololol and caffeine is called "novolog. " there are no specific rules about the type of caffeine you should consume. the only thing that you can do is choose the right type of product. if you are a coffee drinker and you have a lot of caffeine in your system you can choose to have a more concentrated version of coffee. if the caffeine is very concentrated you may want to try a more-moderate dose of caffeine like decaffeinated coffee. there are other caffeine-containing products out there that are similar to novols but they are not as effective.
Expected Response: this is a very important question so i'm glad you asked. before the new "insulin pens" came out there were four types of insulin : rapid-acting short-acting intermediate-acting and long-acting. when it comes to the pre-mixed insulins like novolog 70/30 there are fewer differences between the brands (for example novolog versus novolin). whether contained in a bottle or in a pen the premixed insulins all contain a combination of both an intermediate-acting insulin and a short-acting insulin. the numbers on the bottle or pen refer to the percentage of each type of insulin contained in the mixture. that means both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 contain a mixture that is 70% intermediate-acting insulin with 30% short-acting insulin. however novolin 70/30 takes slightly longer to begin working than novolog 70/30 which has a rapid onset. both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 may last up to 24 hours in the system. no matter what kind of insulin you've been prescribed it's crucial you understand how to use it correctly. using any insulin incorrectly can cause serious side effects. if you don't understand how to use your insulin please consult a pharmacist as soon as possible. hope this helps!

Question: can anxiety a side affect to depression?
Answer: i don't know. i'm not sure if you're talking about anxiety or depression. you may be just experiencing anxiety or anxiety related symptoms. i don’t know if you are talking about a side effect or not. i do know that anxiety is a side-effect of depression. if you have anxiety you may have a harder time dealing with it. if your anxiety is related to depression you may need to see a mental health professional.
Expected Response: not a side effect per se but a person can have both anxiety and depression. hi if you google depression it come up as depression and anxiety they do go hand in hand. but if your having problems with it and your male it will affect your sex life depression and anxiety are known sex killers also the drugs for it are also sex killers. google natural ways out of depression and anxiety your find lots of drug free help for being drug free its well worth doing if you do choose to go drug free please do this through your doctor. and your doctor wont like you doing it there's no drug kick back money in it for him/her you being drug free. do hope this helps you. good luck

Answer: yes you can restart your medication. you can do so by going to your doctor. you may need to take a blood test to see if your blood sugar is normal. if not you may want to consult your doctor to see how you can improve.
Expected Response: i would like to know why you decided to stop taking your medications and does your doctor or health care provider know? this is very risky and it is important that you understand that with some medications you should not just stop them abruptly because you felt like it. nor is it wise to just "start them up" again when you feel like it. i would strongly recommend that you call your doctor and let them know what you did. they may want to see you for further evaluation and gradually ease you back onto your medications.

Question: how can i be sure my cosmetic surgery will be safe?
Answer: cosmetic surgery is not recommended for people with a history of serious health conditions such as heart disease diabetes or cancer. however if you have a history or medical condition that requires a surgical procedure then you should talk with your surgeon about the risks and benefits of the procedure.
Expected Response: i think the two most important safety questions that a patient can ask the doctor is one will there be a fully accredited anesthesia specialist in attendance anesthesia specialist being either a certified registered nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist. that’s number one. second is the facility accredited? now accreditation is kind of a broad term. for instance the facility could be licensed by the state. states do that. hospitals are licensed. the state will license a facility. the federal government does the same. in other words you cannot operate on a medicare patient and expect medicare to pay for it unless they’ve given it the stamp of approval. by the way the standards are almost identical. and some facilities for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in do their evaluation and asked to be approved. but there are also private credentialing companies that do this and by the way most hospitals in the united states are accredited by essentially what is called the joint commission. it’s called the joint commission on accreditation of health facilities. this licenses hospitals outpatient surgery centers radiology x-ray clinics. so again very high standards so that there is no a or b it’s all a. if you get the right answers to those questions you’ll feel comfortable. and i would tell you also parenthetically most of the doctor anesthesiologists that i know will not work in an unaccredited unlicensed facility because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. for example if the facility didn’t have all the appropriate life support systems why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong he doesn’t have the technical backup. he doesn’t want to be in that position. he wants to deliver to the patient when needed if needed as remote as that possibility is he wants to deliver the best he has.

Question: what is vocal cord dysfunction?
Answer: vocal cord problems are caused by a number of different factors. some of the most common are: a lack of oxygen in the blood. this can lead to a low level of oxygen and can lead the body to become congested. a lack or lack of a good balance of blood oxygen and nutrients. this is called a "bitter smell". a lack in oxygen in your blood can also be caused by: a deficiency in the body's own oxygen supply. this means that your blood oxygen levels are not getting enough oxygen to meet the body’s needs. a poor balance of oxygen is called "breathlessness. " this means your blood is not getting oxygen to your lungs. a person with a low oxygen level can have a low heart rate or low blood pressure. a low blood oxygen level may be due to a deficiency of oxygen which can lead a person to have a heart attack or stroke. a deficiency can also result from a lack (

Question: i am 67 years old and on medicare. i also have supplemental health insurance. i assume the aca will not give me any plans that are more affordable but what benefits do i have as a senior under the aca (besides the reductions in my medication bill)?
Answer: the acA does not cover medicare for seniors. it covers health insurance for people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. the affordable care act does not expand medicare to all people. if you qualify for medicare you can get a subsidy to help pay for your premium.
Expected Response: that's right. you are not eligible for plans sold through the new health insurance marketplaces. the gap in prescription drug costs closing is one of the biggest benefits of the law for seniors covered by medicare. other benefits such as no cost preventive screenings and wellness visits.

Question: what kind of painkiller can i take that wont thin my blood. i have fibromyalgia and in a lot of pain. i'm on cumadin due to blood clot's after a surgery i'm currently taking a muscle relaxer called skelaxin for the pain but it doesn't help the pain if taken alone. when i take it with ibuprofen or naproxin it seems to help a lot. can i take either of these pills given the fact that i'm on blood thinner medication? if not what can i take to help pain?
Answer: hi its all down to how much you take. if you are on the wrong side of the drug its best you take the right side of your pill. do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: the best answer to your question is this: consult your physician. you're smart to think about the "blood thinning" properties of over-the-counter pain relievers given you're on coumadin (warfarin). generally speaking it's not wise to take any nsaid -- such as aspirin naproxyn or ibuprofen -- when you're taking warfarin or another anti-clotting drug. in this case acetaminophen (tylenol) is your only over-the-counter option. however you should ask your health care provider what to do in your specific case. everyone is different and your provider may be able to give you a prescription pain reliever that will not interact with the warfarin. wishing you well! soma or carisoprodol is a generic drug and is used for the treatment of muscle pain and muscle injury. it is used by the person who is suffering from muscle sprain and pain. you can from chemist shop or online at topdrugmart dot com

Question: do you find patients are embarrassed to ask a doctor about sexual concerns?
Answer: you may not be embarrassed to talk about sexual issues but you may be embarrassed that you may have a problem with your partner. you may want to ask your doctor about the sexual behaviors that you are having. if you have a history of depression or anxiety you may need to talk to your doctor.
Expected Response: yes and i think doctors are too. but sexual issues are important to discuss. doctors have to read their patients well. you have to get a sense of their comfort level with you and how willing they are to talk about personal issues. i think when the doctor does bring it up it shows it's ok to talk about sex. sometimes the patient is surprised -- or even relieved -- that the doctor raises the subject because it means they don't have to.

Question: what is uric acid?
Answer: uric acids are substances that are produced by the body's own cells. the body makes them by making certain chemicals called uric compounds. uric products can be used to treat certain conditions such as diabetes or cancer. in addition to uric-acid-containing products such as acetaminophen and aspirin uric medications can also be used for pain and fever.
Expected Response: uric acid is a chemical breakdown product of metabolism. the liver produces uric acid by breaking down other chemicals called purines. uric acid is normally found in the blood in low concentrations. some people are prone to high uric acid levels which can sometimes lead to gout kidney stones or kidney damage. people with gout nearly always have high blood levels of uric acid although their levels may sometimes drop down to the normal range. due to the high uric acid concentration and other factors experts don’t understand uric acid crystals can form inside joints. during gout attacks uric acid crystal deposits cause joints to become inflamed swollen red and painful. exercise reduced red meat and alcohol intake and medications can help keep uric acid levels in the normal range.

Question: i'm having terrible ear and neck pain chest pains and i have a lump in my left breast. what could this mean? . i have a mammogram appointment in a few days. i have also been having pain in my groin area. i have a huge family history of cancer and i'm scared to death.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. unfortunately it's impossible to say what you're experiencing without a physical examination. however i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a podiatrist to get a better diagnosis. the best thing you can do is get a mammography and a chest x-ray. your doctor can help you sort out what's going on. you may have a more accurate diagnosis but you're still going to need to see a primary care doctor for a proper examination.
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. the fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with. i'm glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled. that is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation. while you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system. look for support from family and friends. try to distract yourself. focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem. if you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress. even though you have a family history of cancer it's not a sure bet you have cancer too. it's entirely possible your breast lump is benign (non-cancerous) and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress. i know it's hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis. take care of yourself!
================================================================================
Question: can i self-administer systematic desensitization to treat a phobia or does it have to be under the care of a therapist?
Answer: yes. self-administration of desensitized medications is an important part of treating phobias. it can help to treat phobia that is not related to the medication but may be related to a symptom of the condition. self administered desensitizization may be used to treat anxiety disorder (a phobia) or panic disorder. self prescribed desensits can be used for anxiety disorders. self treated desensitic medications are not recommended for people who have a phobic disorder.
Expected Response: hmmm. well the concept is to gradually expose oneself to the stimulus that provokes anxiety and exinguish the fear response by graded exposure. i suppose if someone knows what they are doing then there's no reason they couldn't apply the principle on their own as they saw fit. depending on what the fear was one would want some grasp of knowing how much exposure is too much and what to do if the technique didn't work.

Question: i left an off clip on repellent on overnight with the windows open woke up with a right side headache & bloody nose. that was two days ago and the only thing still happening is the headache. i was feeling that i was getting sick before that because of right ear pain. poison control said it should not be a big problem because off has a low concentration of deet but my headache wont go away. should i wait or go to a doc asap feels like a muscular pain because it is tender to pressure and hurts more when i turn my head the pain travels down to my posterior neck muscles (right side).
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'm glad you're feeling better. it sounds like you're experiencing some sort of nerve issue. it's possible that you're having a mild case of "postural hypotension. " i'd suggest you call your doctor right away. if you're still having headaches and you're not feeling better you need to
Expected Response: i agree with poison control. i can't imagine that your headache or bloody nose has anything to do with the fact that you had a clip-on mosquito repellent. the most common cause of headache is the a muscle-tension type but you would need to see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. oh that is a relief! thank you! but it's strange because no pain meds are helping at all with the pain. it is very possible it was caused by over exposure to this product. the off clip on does not use deet but a different kind of repellent called metofluthrin so the symptoms will not be the same as over exposure to deet. the first day i used one for a 3 hour hunt i got a pretty severe headache that started about 30 minutes after the hunt and lasted about 4 hours. i was just recovering from a virus to i initially thought nothing of it. later the same day i found one of the top customer reviews for this product on amazon. com mentions it caused severe headaches almost everytime he used it. the warning labels seem to go overboard in cautioning you to wash your hands and clothes after handling to the point it made me a bit nervous about using the product. i would venture to say from my own experience and the amazon reviewers experiences using the product as directed and still getting headaches if you fell asleep in an enclosed space with this thing blowing that its almost certain that most of your symptoms can be attributed to it. this is apparently some extremely potent poison.

Question: how do you get pregnant? . especially when it's difficult to ovulate. i have had a miscarriage in a month. i was diagnosed with a miscarriage a few weeks ago. i've been on birth control for over a year now. i haven't had any problems with pregnancy. i'm still worried about the possibility of pregnancy.
Answer: hi if you are pregnant then you will need to get on your bc pill and get on to the bc pill pack and get your period. good luck
Expected Response: if you are having unprotected sex and have not conceived it may be time for you to see a gynecologist or fertility specialist to see if there is an underlying medical reason in you or your partner. the female body is designed to get pregnant; not to prevent it. many times there are discoverable reasons so you first step is to be properly examined and evaluated.

Question: what causes rumbling noise in both ears? . what causes rumbling like a motor running in both ears? i can't hear bass tones. my blood pressure is good. . i have no other symptoms.
Answer: i would suggest you see a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: it may be pressure buildup in your ears which can happen from allergies. you could try an over-the-counter allergy treatment -- something with a decongestant if you have no heart problems and your blood pressure is fine (make sure to read the label to make sure the medication is ok for you) -- for a few days and see if that helps. if not you should check with your doctor as you don't want to ignore hearing loss.

Question: took diazepam 25 years ago for 15 years -- how can i counter any brain damage?
Answer: there are several ways to treat brain damage. you can try a variety of medications to help control your symptoms. some are non-drug treatments that can help reduce the effects of certain medications. some medications can be taken in combination with other medications to decrease the side effects of other medications. there are also non-prescription medications that can be used to treat anxiety.
Expected Response: you would have to see a neurologist just to know if you had any diazepam-related brain damage. i do not know the details of your medication use. if you are having any neurological issues that you attribute to brain damage it may not be related at all to your past use of this medication. some parts of the brain recover nicely; other parts do not so it would be impossible for any medical provider to blindly delve into your case to such details over the internet.
================================================================================
Question: any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i'm too tired to cook after work?
Answer: it's important to keep in mind that you can't always eat the same food over and over again. so it's best to get to know your food preferences so you can make sure you're eating the right amount of food. you can try different types of fruit and vegetables (and even whole grains) and try different foods in different ways. eat a balanced diet. for example try a salad with a salad dressing and a salad bar with a dressing. also try a grilled cheese sandwich with a grilled cheeseburger and a grilled salad bar. you might try a different type of cheese or a different cheese blend. try different cheeses and different sauces. try a variety of different cheeseburgers and sauces. eat the right type of food at the right time. for instance try a cheese-free sandwich that's made with cheese and tomato paste. eat at the same time. try to eat
Expected Response: you are definitely not alone. however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day. for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite. if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to (and not calories) like rotisserie chicken. just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro. pick out veggies at the salad bar — they are already washed chopped and prepped for you. you can take them home and roast them in a 450 degree f oven for 5-7 minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. this is a great and easy veggie side dish that wouldn’t take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils. sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating. for instance tonight i got home after 12 hours of traveling and i’m battling over what i could make for dinner — or — to pick up thai food. i think that thai is going to win tonight. but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order. i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk. while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra 1000 calories that can come from some of the richer choices won’t be worth it. what will be a much better choice will still be delicious. spring rolls that are fresh — not fried — and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice. another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil (ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants). also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice. i’m reminding myself of this as i am you. when i’m tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice. another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out. many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices.
================================================================================
Question: how successful are today’s vasectomy reversals?
Answer: the vasectomy reversal is a surgical procedure that is performed by a skilled surgeon who has the skill and expertise to perform the procedure safely and effectively.
Expected Response: with advances in technique the microsutures the instruments that we use the magnification and scopes pre and post-operative care we can achieve fertility in 90 to 95 percent of the men after they’ve had a vasectomy and as far out as 42 years after they’ve had a vasectomy. does it matter how old or archaic your vasectomy was? not at all. it’s not the technique of the vasectomy that’s important. it’s not even the number of years since your vasectomy. it really is dependent on two factors. one is the skill and expertise of the microsurgeon does he or she know what they are doing and can do it well as well as female factors. if you fall in love with a 25-year-old who’s demonstrated prior fertility things are probably going to be great. you don’t need that much. on the other hand if you fall in love with a 54-year-old woman who is going through menopause then you’re going to have a real hard time with conception no matter how good the surgeon is. so it’s female factor and skill and expertise of the microsurgeon are the major factors in determining the success of the reversal.

Question: 3 year olds nose has a bad smell coming fron it's like a bad cough. i have had this problem for over a year now. it's not a bad nose but it's a bad odor coming from the nose. it comes and goes. it doesn't hurt or hurt when i cough. it has been going on for about 4 years now. i've had this nose problem for about a year. i don't know if it's related to the nose or not. i just want to know if this is something that can be fixed.
Answer: i don’t know. i would suggest you see your primary care provider. the smell is probably from the mucous coming out of the nose but the smell may be something else. you may need to see your medical provider to see if the nose problem is related to your allergies or allergies to certain medications.
Expected Response: the most common reason for this is a foreign body usually food. your three-year old for some reason decided it was a good idea to put a green bean pea or? in the nose. if there is a bad smell and a nasty drainage from just one-side this is the most likely reason. nasal foreign bodies can be challenging to remove so it may be a good idea to allow the medical provider to do it for you.

Question: i am single no children age 45 and at the moment unemployed. . often i perform independent work or part-time assignments and have not been carrying an individual health plan for myself since 2006. what low-cost options are there for someone like me with or without a job?
Answer: you need to work for a health insurance plan that offers coverage for the lowest cost. if you are not eligible for a subsidy you will need to buy a plan through your state's marketplace. if your employer offers a plan you can buy one at no cost. you can find a plan at healthcare. gov.
Expected Response: for people with very low incomes the law provides a fair amount of financial assistance to make insurance affordable. depending on how much you earn in a year you may qualify for medicaid coverage which would be virtually no-cost coverage. if you make too much to qualify or you live in a state not expanding its medicaid program you'll likely qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of your insurance. to give you an early idea of your likely costs check out webmd's cost calculator. starting october 1st you can log on to your state's marketplace and start shopping for a health plan to learn your options.

Question: gave boyfriend oral then ate an hour later got home and felt mucus in throat and spit. it went down my body. pregnant? . gave my boyfriend oral and swallowed some. then ate a small burger and some coke. an hour later i took a shower. while in the shower i felt then need to spit i felt like mucus so i did spit. worried that spit contained sperm and traveled down my body and got me pregnant. i did not insert anything in not even with fingers and i was obviously standing while in shower but spit went through middle of my stomach so i am sure it passed by my vagina. i am only 19 help? can i be pregnant?
Answer: hi you should get tested for a uti but not if you are not pregnant. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer based on your story you are highly highly unlikely to get pregnant in this way. sperm may look like tadpoles but they do not remain viable for very long in the mouth/throat and any expectorate that flowed past your genital area in the shower an hour later would not have the potential of cause you to become pregnant. swallowed semen cannot result in a pregnancy and even if there was a stray super-sperm that flowed past your vaginal area it would be a one in a zillion chance that it would squiggle up your vagina through your uterus and make it to a viable egg (assuming your were ovulating at the time. you are engaging in sexual activity which tends to escalate to more risky behavior in the future so you would be wise to use effective contraception from now on.

Question: are there safe ways to help the body miscarriage a fetus that has been dead from week 6 to 10 of pregnancy? . sad day today. my wife had her 1st sonogram she is in her 10th week of pregnancy. unfortunately they detected that the fetus had stopped growing after the first 6 weeks and had no heart beat. . this is apparently not uncommon. our doctors offered us two choices wait until her body miscarries naturally or have her cervix scrapped. my question is is there a safe way to help her body expel the fetus? it doesn't have to be 100% sure as her body will do it sooner or later. thank you in advance.

Question: can i take otc zantac after taking otc prilosec?
Answer: i don't know. i don’t know the details of your case.
Expected Response: i would like to know why you want to take otc zantac. both of these medications are used to treat heartburn but they are usually not taken together. it should be one or the other. zantac works by trying to decrease the amount of acid in the stomach where prilosec turns off the pump that makes stomach acid. typically you should take prilosec for 14 days in the treatment of heartburn. i would also like to ask if you are taking any other medications since zantac can interact with many of them.

Question: i had a large injection of penicillin for strep. 2 days later my lymph nodes have swollen substantially. is this normal? . tuesday afternoon i started feeling sick sore throat cough body aches fatigue headache. thursday it felt so bad i went to the er. they glanced at my throat declared it to be strep shot me full of steroids painkillers and penicillin then sent me on my way. i began to feel better that day and yesterday felt mostly normal except for a persistent productive cough and weak voice. but as of this morning my lymph nodes are absurdly swollen and very tender. possible explanations?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a viral infection. it's not uncommon for viral infections to cause sore throat and fever. strep is not a viral illness. it is a bacterial infection. streptococcus pneumoniae is a common bacterial infection that can cause sore throats and fever for up to three days
Expected Response: those "glances" that pronounce a strep diagnosis really bug me. i hate those "treat 'em and street 'em" medical encounters. a strep test is so easy. so fast. so why not get an accurate definitive diagnosis before treating anyone with antibiotics and steroids? most sore throats are viral. not strep. and one of those viruses (ebv) causes mononucleosis (mono). giving antibiotics to someone with undiagnosed mono is worthless and can actually make things worse. a mono test is easy to do as well but apparently the er medical provider didn't want to take those extra steps. lymph nodes normally enlarge in response to infection or inflammation in their neighborhood so strep (if you really had it) respiratory viruses and mono can all cause lymph node enlargements. viruses (even mono) self-resolve over time and do not respond to antibiotics. if you did have strep the penicillin injection (painful! ) would have taken care of it. if you don't get better see your regular medical provider. and insist on a careful thorough examination for mono and a few diagnostic lab tests.

Question: is tinnitus and shingles related? . hello i have both tinnitus and shingles for several years and it seems to be getting worst. for the last few months i have been very sick with tinnitus. this week shingles broke out on both sides of my butt (left side lower and right side higher). do you know if tinnitus and shingles are related? thank you. .
Answer: i have no way of knowing if you have both or not but i would be very very curious to see if you are both. i have had both of them before and they were very different. i would not be able to blindly guess if you both are related but i do have the feeling that you both have a common cause.
Expected Response: only if the shingles is in the ears. called ramsay-hunt syndrome. if you had this herpes infection in your ear area it can also cause tinnitus in some people. if you have herpes on your butt. tinnitus would not be related. shingles does not break out on both sides of your buttocks (it follows a nerve pathway and nerves do not cross over the midline of the spine) so i am guessing you have an incorrect diagnosis. you likely have something other than shingles causing your skin eruption.

Question: i stepped on a rusty nail 6/16/2013. i had a tetanus booster in 2008 after an injury. do i need to get another one now? . yesterday i stepped on a rusty nail while i was out by the horses. it went through my shoe and into my foot about 1/4" deep. it only bled about a drop so i soaked it last night in warm salt water for about an hour to help clean it out. i know i had a tetanus booster in 2008 after an injury. i do not remember if i have had one since then. i have been told that tetanus boosters are good for 5-10 years. do i need to get another booster now or is the one i know i got in 2008 sufficient?
Answer: you should not have to worry about getting another tetanus vaccine again. tetanus is a very rare disease that can occur in any age group. you may need to see your primary health care provider to get a diagnosis
Expected Response: tetanus shots are statistically good for ten years although many clinicians will suggest a booster after five years. tetanus shots only prevent tetanus (lockjaw). it does not prevent a wound infection so watch for any signs of infection. it is really up to you to get a tetanus booster or not but theoreticallyl your vaccine is 2008 is still effective.

Question: will i get a false passitive if i take a pregnacy test while on birth control. i am on birthcontrol and my boyfriend and i are both on the pill. i have been taking the pill for about 4 months now and i have never had a false positive. i'm not on any form of birth control and i do not know if i will get pregnant again.
Answer: hi ok it could be a false negative but it would be best to see your doctor and get tested for it. good luck
Expected Response: what kind of birth control? if you are talking about the birth control pill then the answer is no. the birth control pill will not cause a false pregnancy test. a person can have a false pregnancy test anyway but not because of the pill. pregnancy tests check for the presence of a hormone called hcg. the pill does not have hcg.
================================================================================
Question: i have pustular psoriasis. i have small blisters on my hands and feet that bleed. what can i do? . i have been told that it is not curable. people seem to see it and think they can get it. help!
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you've been diagnosed with pustulitis. it's not uncommon to have pusillar psorias. it may be caused by a variety of things but it's important to remember that pusilitis is not contagious. it can be caused from any of the following: eating raw fish or shellfish (such as tuna or tunahead) eating raw meat or shell fish (such: salmon or mackerel) eating contaminated food such as contaminated laundry detergent or food that has been contaminated with bacteria. eating raw or contaminated food with a lot of bacteria. or eating raw foods that contain bacteria. for more information about pusiliitis
Expected Response: pustular psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that most commonly occurs on the hands and feet. it is not infectious and not contagious. one of the best treatments is topical puva where a topical solution is applied to the areas and then exposed to ultraviolet light for specific amounts of time. there are dermatologists and university dermatology programs that have hand/foot light boxes and would be able to offer this treatment. we also use prescription-strength topical steroids and topical vitamin d to help control the condition. it is a chronic autoimmune condition with a genetic predisposition so it is not curable but it can be well-controlled.
================================================================================
Question: is there any truth to the eggplant dinner before labor? is there a pharmaceutical equivalent?
Answer: the eggplants are not the same as the egg-plant. they are different. eggplant is a plant that is grown in a closed environment. the egg is a closed structure. it is not a closed eggplant. it has a closed shell. the shell is the egg's outer shell.
Expected Response: there are a number of old wives tales regarding foods to eat to induce labor. unfortunately there are no studies in this area to prove the truth to these ideas. a prescription medication called pitocin (oxytocin) is used in the hospital to start or improve contractions.

Question: does a vasectomy protect against hiv/aids and other sexually transmitted diseases?
Answer: yes. the vasectomy is safe.
Expected Response: although it is extremely effective for preventing pregnancy vasectomy does not offer protection against hiv/aids or other sexually transmitted diseases. consequently it is important that vasectomized men continue to use condoms preferably latex which offer considerable protection against the spread of disease in any sexual encounter that carries the risk of contracting or transmitting infection.

================================================================================
Question: how do i become a better runner as someone with moderate experience running?
Answer: i would recommend you get started running now. the best way to start is to run. and if you are running at a high level you will likely get better.
Expected Response: don’t get stuck constantly doing the same thing. challenge your current routine by experimenting with different types of runs. for example incorporate long runs to build endurance intervals to increase speed or hills to increase strength. you might find that experimenting with these different types of runs can add to the enjoyment you experience while running and can help to promote better running performance. next consider occasionally doing cross-training which in this case means doing exercise other than running. for example try adding swimming biking or strength training to your current exercise routine. cross-training helps to prevent burnout whether physical or mental and can help prevent overuse injuries. sometimes repeatedly doing the same exercise can be monotonous and redundant and you might get bored and want to discontinue with your exercise. adding variety to your routine can help keep exercise enjoyable for you. finally allow yourself time to rest and recover. over-training can hurt your progress and lead to injury such as stress fractures. resting is as important as the time you dedicate towards running.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe to have cosmetic surgery while breastfeeding?
Answer: yes it is safe to breastfeed while breastfeeding.
Expected Response: that issue revolves around what medication one will get during the procedure and whether or not these medications would enter the milk and then be passed to the infant. each medication that is given in the operating room and post-operatively has a history of whether or not it would be likely to enter into the mother’s milk. but frankly science is never 100% and i am very cautious and conservative. i don’t believe in taking any chances with the new baby and therefore i would suggest that if a mother is breastfeeding that the surgery be put off until breastfeeding is complete. the alternative would be for the mother to just stop breastfeeding for some period of time and not resume it until we are quite certain that all the medications have cleared from the system which is typically a matter of some days.

Question: pvc dildo not properly cleaned after anal use. can i still use it if i clean it? . i used a dido anally a few weeks back and i checked it today. it's a dildo with a syringe for squirting so it has a hole through it. it's made of pvc. when i checked it today there was something inside the hole for squirting that i can only assume was fecal matter. i want to avoid infections at all costs so is this toy safe to use if i clean it properly? should it now be used with a condom only andhow can i clean it to make it safe again? i have not used it again since i found this.
Answer: i would recommend that you clean the toy thoroughly and thoroughly after using it. if you are using a condom it is not likely that you will have a vaginal infection. if the toy is not properly sanitized and cleaned you will need to use a condom.
Expected Response: pvc like silicone is non porous so if you clean it properly it will be safe. it's worthwhile to go to a smoke shop or craft store and pick up a pack of pipe cleaners they are perfect for going in that little hole and catching anything you need to. then fill the syringe with some rubbing alcohol and pass it through a few times clean the outside with more rubbing alcohol let it dry and you're good to go.

Question: can you have a bad tooth pulled and then wait a year to replace bone and have a dental implant inserted? . i have a good tooth pulled but i have not had a bad dental implant.
Answer: you have to wait a long time for a dental replacement. you can't have a "bad tooth pulled" unless you have an implant.
Expected Response: theoretically yes. but i believe it may be better to do the bone graft at the time of extraction. ask your dentist if there are any payment arrangement options that you can use to help you pay for the treatment you need.

Question: what are the different kinds of hives?
Answer: hives are caused by a virus that causes a variety of problems including: high fever high blood pressure high cholesterol high blood sugar high cholesterol and high blood cholesterol.
Expected Response: hives fall into two categories: acute urticaria (ordinary hives which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic urticaria (which continue longer than six to eight weeks). ordinary urticaria (ordinary hives) what are symptoms and signs of ordinary hives? ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. welts appear often in several places. they flare itch swell and go away in a matter of minutes to hours only to appear elsewhere. this sequence may go on from days to weeks. most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. although that cutoff point is arbitrary hives that last more than six weeks are often called "chronic. " what are the causes of ordinary hives? as noted above many cases of ordinary hives are "idiopathic " meaning no cause is known. others may be triggered by viral infections. a few may be caused by medications usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (it is uncommon for drugs taken continuously for long periods to cause hives or other reactions. ) when a medication is implicated as a cause of hives the drug must be stopped since no skin or blood test will prove the connection. in most cases drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. if a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away this is a strong indication that the medication was not in fact the cause of the hives. some medications like morphine codeine aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids such as ibuprofen [advil]) cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. despite the reputation hives have for being "allergic " when there is no obvious connection between something new that a person has been exposed to and the onset of hives allergy testing is not usually helpful. chronic hives chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. the evaluation of this condition is difficult and allergy testing and other laboratory tests are rarely useful in such cases. the accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history personal habits and oral intake. occasionally it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. certain systemic disease and infections may occasionally present in the skin as hives. if there is an inciting cause that can be determined then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective or in the case of food or drug allergy strict avoidance would be necessary. there are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. there are tests available to identify this type of hives. physical urticaria is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. by far the most common form is dermographism which literally means "skin writing. " this is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed: a red welt appears at the line of the scratch. in dermographism raised itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin causing mast cells to leak histamine. another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. this produces hundreds of small itchy bumps. these occur within 15 minutes of exercise or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. this form of hives happens more often in young people. other forms of physical hives are much less common. triggers for these include cold water and sunlight.

Answer: pneumonia is a common complication of pneumonia. it is caused by a virus that causes a variety of respiratory infections. it can be caused by: pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics. pneumonia can also be treated by antibiotics. a person can get pneumonia from any of the following: a person who has had a respiratory infection for more than a year. a cold. a cough. a flu. a sore throat. a fever. a runny nose. a rash. a severe cough. pneumonia is contagious from person to person. a contagious person may get pneumonia if they: have a cold or cough that is not contagious to another person. have a cough that causes you to cough. have an infection that causes the body to produce a virus called a pneumococcal virus. a virus can cause pneumonia in people who have had a cold (such as a cold sore throat or a runnny nose). if you have a sore chest or throat that
Expected Response: after you've been infected with a pneumonia -causing organism it takes as little as 1 to 3 days or as long as 7 to 10 days for symptoms to appear. how severe pneumonia is and how long it lasts depend on: your age and health. older sicker people usually have more severe cases and their pneumonia is more likely to have complications such as bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) or throughout the body (septicemia). whether bacteria or a virus caused the pneumonia. viral pneumonia usually is less severe than bacterial pneumonia. how quickly you treat it. the sooner you treat pneumonia the sooner symptoms go away. your immune system. people who have impaired immune systems are more likely to have more severe cases of pneumonia than people who have healthy immune systems. in healthy people pneumonia can be a mild illness that is hardly noticed and clears up in 2 to 3 weeks. in older adults and in people with other health problems recovery may take 6 to 8 weeks or longer. if you have severe pneumonia you may have to go to the hospital. in most cases of pneumonia you get in your daily life such as at school or work (community-based pneumonia) it is not necessary to go to the hospital. 1 about one-third of people with community-based pneumonia are age 65 or older. 1 older adults are treated in the hospital more often and stay longer for the condition than younger people. 1 pneumonia is more serious in this group because they often have and may develop other medical problems. 1 if your pneumonia is caused by a virus or bacteria you may spread the infection to other people while you are contagious. how long you are contagious depends on what is causing the pneumonia and whether you get treatment. you may be contagious for several days to a week. if you get antibiotics you usually cannot spread the infection to others after a day of treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: i have a plantar wart on the heel of my foot. is there something i can buy over-the-counter for this?
Answer: no. there are no over- the-counter products that will treat plantar warts.
Expected Response: salicylic acid is available at drug stores for wart removal. however if the wart is in a very callused place you may want to have your health care professional freeze the wart off with prescription-strength medication. sanding the skin down can flake off the wart and transfer it to another location on the body. seek medical advice for the quickest safest removal.

Question: can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever? . my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on. he won't go to a doctor because he does not have insurance. just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling "under the weather" for a few days. no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache. so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body.
Answer: hi i think your find the same thing. your find that if you have a cold then you get cold sores. but if you get a cold and get a sore throat then you will get a virus. but for the rest of your life it could just be a virus or just a cold. good luck
Expected Response: whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (99. 9 oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!

Expected Response: most food contains several kinds of fat and some are better for you than others. some fat is needed in your diet so it’s not a good idea to completely eliminate all fat. instead choose foods with healthier fats and enjoy them in moderation. unhealthy fats include saturated and trans fats (also called partially hydrogenated fats). sources of unhealthy fats come from eggs meat dairy and tropical oils (coconut palm and palm kernel oils). good fats include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. healthy fat sources include nuts seeds avocados olives and other plants. healthy oils aid in having healthy skin hair and a strong immune system. saturated fats and trans fats grams should be less than 10% of your total calories for the day. to determine the healthfulness of fat consider where it comes from -- animal vs. plant origin. healthy fats coming from plants (and fish) are beneficial for health especially when replacing saturated fat (animal fats) in the diet. at too high levels saturated fats can adversely affect heart health. saturated fats are found in high-fat meats full-fat dairy baked goods and fried foods. trans fat the worse fat of all is mostly found in products (i. e margarine) that contain vegetable oils that have been "partially hydrogenated" to become solid at room temperature. since 2006 fda requires companies to label trans fat in food products. if an item contains <. 5g it can be labeled "trans-fat free. "&nbsp; because the american heart association recommends 2g or less per day for the average 2000 calorie diet check the ingredient line for partially hydrogenated fats. &nbsp;for example &nbsp;natural peanut butter only has peanuts (and salt in some cases) in the ingredient line but other peanut butter products often contain partially hydrogenated oils and added sugar. &nbsp; for more on good and bad fats see this webmd article <link> while some dietary fats are good and some are bad; perhaps the worst is trans fat. this type of fat can occur naturally in animal products but is also the result of food manufacturers chemically altering oils through a process called hydrogenation. the reason that trans fat is so detrimental is because it not only raises bad (ldl) cholesterol levels but some research suggests that it also lowers our good (hdl) cholesterol levels as well – a double whammy. saturated fats on the other hand raise both good and bad cholesterol levels. common food sources of trans fat can include: • baked goods such as bread pizza dough and cake • fried foods such as french fries doughnuts or chicken nuggets • snack foods such as chips crackers cookies and candy • pre-packaged foods such as soup or frozen meals • margarines or spreads be cautious because the fda allows for food products to be labeled as “0 trans fat” even though there may be up to 0. 5 grams per serving. read this webmd article for more information: <link>. heathy fats come from healthy foods like nuts and unheathy fats come from fatty foods chips. healhty fats and polyunsaturated fats which help to get better healthy by removing cholestrol and unhealthy fats are saturated trans fats which increases the risk of heart attacks.

Question: is it true that using two condoms are better than one?
Answer: condoms are not "better" than one. they are a great idea. they're the best.
Expected Response: our society generally believes two is better than one. the problem is that the way condoms are designed using two condoms at the same time could actually do more harm than good. it could cause some friction between the condoms that could actually cause more breakage and leakage. so we like to let everyone know especially teens to keep it simple. just use one condom each and every time you have sex. viruses can get through some of the natural skin condoms so they don't protect against all sexually transmitted infections. we recommend the latex--or polyurethane which tend to be more expensive but need to be used by people who have latex allergies. it's important that teens recognize that the condom needs to be put on as soon as there’s an erection. not waiting until there's been a little foreplay because there's ejaculate that can be released that can cause both stds and unplanned pregnancies. even though it's so important to use a condom consistently and correctly many teens don't know how. health care providers teen clinics and educational materials can provide information on how to use a condom properly.

Expected Response: blood tests on the pancreas and liver can come back normal and there could still be gallbladder trouble. the blood tests just show that the potential problem with the gallbladder hasn't started effecting the other organs yet. this situation happened to me as well. the ultrasound should give you much more info. good luck!

Question: what are the different types of psoriatic arthritis?
Answer: psoriasis is a condition in which the skin is thinning and inflamed. the skin may also become inflamed and crusty. the crusty skin is often called psoriatitis. psoriata is a common skin condition that affects about one in every 100 people. it is caused by a combination of a genetic predisposition to psoriato-type arthritis and a genetic defect that causes the skin to become inflaming. psoriasis is a skin condition in people who have a genetic susceptibility to psoritis. it usually occurs in people with a genetic vulnerability to psorsitis.
Expected Response: there are five types of psoriatic arthritis. it is important to know which type of psoriatic arthritis you have and to understand the characteristics so that it may be treated properly. symmetric psoriatic arthritis : symmetric arthritis affects the same joints -- usually in multiple matching pairs -- on opposite sides of the body. symmetric psoriatic arthritis can be disabling causing varying degrees of progressive destructive disease and loss of function in 50% of people with this type of arthritis. symmetric psoriatic arthritis resembles rheumatoid arthritis. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis : asymmetric arthritis typically involves one to three joints in the body -- large or small -- such as the knee hip or one or several fingers. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis does not affect matching pairs of joints on opposite sides of the body. distal interphalangeal predominant (dip) : distal interphalangeal predominant psoriatic arthritis involves primarily the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. dip psoriatic arthritis is sometimes confused with osteoarthritis a chronic disease that causes the deterioration of joint cartilage and bone as well as bone spurs at the joints. spondylitis : spondylitis affects the spinal column and may cause inflammation and stiffness in the neck lower back spinal vertebrae or sacroiliac region (pelvic area) making motion difficult. spondylitis also can attack connective tissue such as ligaments or cause arthritic disease in the joints of the arms hips legs or feet. arthritis mutilans : arthritis mutilans is a severe deforming and destructive form of psoriatic arthritis that primarily affects the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. this leads to lost function of the involved joints. it also is frequently associated with lower back and neck pain. fortunately this type of psoriatic arthritis is rare.

Question: what is sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome?
Answer: saphos are a group of skin conditions that are common in people with psoriasis. psorias are often caused by a fungus called the varicella sinensis. the fungus is caused by an infection called a yeast infection. psorsias are also called "fungus-like" skin conditions. psoriatic skin conditions are caused by inflammation of the skin and are sometimes called psoratitis. psoreas are a type of skin condition that is caused when the skin cells become inflamed. psores are caused when a fungus grows on the skin. the fungi cause inflammation of certain areas of the body. psorrhea is a skin condition caused by bacteria that live in the skin that causes psoriasis. psoria is a condition in which the skin becomes inflamed and the skin is inflamed when the fungus grows. psoric
Expected Response: sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome is a chronic disorder that involves the skin bone and joints. synovitis means inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). typically this causes warmth tenderness pain swelling and stiffness of involved joints (arthritis). acne is a skin condition featuring tiny areas of inflammation with pus formation at the hair follicles. acne occurs most commonly on the face and upper back. pustulosis is a very inflammatory skin condition resulting in large fluid-filled blister-like areas (pustules) typically on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet. the skin of these areas peels and flakes (exfoliates). hyperostosis means abnormal excessive growth of bone. the hyperostosis of the sapho syndrome frequently is located at the points of the bone where tendons attach. osteitis means inflammation of the bone. patients with sapho syndrome can develop inflammation of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis) as well as inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) which leads to stiffness and pain of the neck and back.

Question: do facial exercise treatment "machines" really stimulate the muscles in the face and jaw line to tighten them? . i am a 62-year-old female with a sagging jaw line and neck. what can you tell me about this treatment?
Answer: the facial muscles are very sensitive to the effects of certain medications. it is best to get a prescription for this medication. the best way to do this is to see a dermatologist. he or she can recommend a variety of treatments for your problem.
Expected Response: the majority of visible wrinkles that we observe are due to extrinsic aging. extrinsic factors are associated with damage to the upper layers of the skin (epidermis or dermis) primarily from either sun damage or smoking. extrinsic aging cannot be corrected with facial exercises. i encourage daily exercise for your overall health and well-being. however "exercising" your facial muscles will not reverse skin damage or premature wrinkling due to extrinsic factors.

Question: 12 year old living in jamaica was born with umbilical hernia it's the size of a lemon. can /should it be left alone? . it causes him no pain. he says it has not changed in size since he can remember and it doesn't effect his physical activity. he is a very active kid. i think i should send him for surgery but when i saw the jamaican hospital i wonder if it is best to just leave it alone. what would you advise?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. i'm glad you're able to get a hands-on evaluation of your baby's umbilicals. it's important to make sure you're getting the proper care for your baby. you should be able to find a doctor in japan who specializes in umbilically-related conditions. i'd suggest you call the hospital for a consultation. you'll want to be sure to ask the nurse who's treating you if you have any
Expected Response: get it fixed. an umbilical hernia the size of a lemon has the potential of becoming incarceration (trapping a loop of intestine - a medical emergency). it can be a problem with sports and is cosmetically unappealing for a 12-year old boy who would rather develop six-pack abs than have a big bulge on his tummy that causes unwanted attention and ridicule from other teenager. a teenagers body image can be fragile so why not fix this minor problem?

Question: how far in does your lover have to go inside your vaginal area in order to recognize that you have lost your vaginity?
Answer: you can have a vaginal hysterectomy if you have a hystectomy. but you can't have a vaginal hystomy if your partner is a virgin.
Expected Response: why do you really care? the presence of an intact hymen (located at the vaginal opening) is not a definitive sign of virginity since the hymen can spontaneously rupture from riding a bike riding a horse or using a tampon. a male who is getting this close to your vagina does not likely have the medical skills to make any type of determination. at this point men are more interested in just having sex. you have the right to keep your secrets or share them. that is your decision.

Question: my daughter has scabies shes scared she has to throw away all of her stuffed animals. help please. how do i save them? . she was diagnosed today. the animals cant be washed. what do i do? is there a spray or something that can be used on her bed as well?
Answer: i would suggest that you see your medical provider for a thorough examination. scabies can be contagious and it is not likely that you will be able to catch it. you will need to see a medical professional to make sure that your baby is not getting it.
Expected Response: she does not have to discard her stuffed animals. scabies is an insect parasite that lives under the skin. scabies must feed on blood in order to survive and stuffed animals do not have blood. just wash the sheets in hot water and put them in a hot dryer. spray the bed with an effective insecticide that covers scabies. put the stuffed animals in a plastic bag for a week or so. if any stray scabies somehow were on those toys they would starve to death quickly.

Question: what is the standard charge for cpt code 19081. i had a stereotactic needle biopsy of a breast (cpt code 19081) and the provider billed the insurance company $6 000. this seems really exhorbitant for a simple needle biopsy. i've been attempting to find out if this is a realistic charge for this procedure.
Answer: it sounds like you are correct. cpt codes are often charged at about $100 per patient. however if you are not paying for a diagnostic procedure it is not uncommon for the provider to charge more for diagnostic procedures. the best way to determine the true cost of a procedure is to compare the cost of the procedure to the cost per patient in the same hospital. this will give you a better idea of what the cost for a procedure will be.
Expected Response: unfortunately there is no standard charge. however there are some price transparency tools that can help give you an idea. if you get insurance at work check to see if your employer offers one. your insurer may also have a pricing tool. and then there are sites such as fairhealthconsumer. org healthbluebook. com and newchoicehealth. com. these generally offer you pricing information based on past insurance claims submitted in your area. hospitals are contracted with insurance companys. hospitals can charge whatever they want. but insurances tell the hospital "per contract" what the hospital is allowed to charge. then the hospital does the contractual "adjustment" and writes off the difference. i. e. : bx costs $20 000. insurance says no contracted rate is $4 000. hospital writes off $16 000 and bills insurance the $4000. every insurance has a contracted rate for the procedure. again the insurance tells the hospital what it's allowed to charge. one insurance says hospital can bill $4000 another says contracted rate is $5000 another says contracted rate is $3000. so it all really depends on what insurance policy you have and what your insurance states the hospital can charge. bc al allowable is $909. 93 and medicare allowable is $ 606. 62

Answer: vitamin d levels are important for healthy bones and are important to maintain healthy bones. vitamin d can be found in foods such as fruits vegetables and nuts. however if you are not taking enough vitamin d you may not be getting enough vitamin b12.
Expected Response: since the 1930s when milk was first fortified with vitamin d to prevent rickets the usual recommendation has been 200 iu to 400 iu daily during times of inadequate sun exposure. women above age 50 should be receiving 400 iu to 800 iu. recently experts in the area have been lobbying for a new recommended level of 1 000 iu daily among adults. the food and nutritional board at the institute of medicine began reviewing the published studies in 2008. . . for comparison the upper tolerable limit (adverse results begin to appear) has been reputed to be 2 000 iu/day. many researchers in the field have suggested that the toxic level is closer to 10 000 iu/day over a more prolonged period of time.

Question: i've been told premiums for health insurance through the exchange will be 2-3 times more than what i currently pay. as of now i have cobra insurance payments that cost more than $1100 for two adults. what can you tell me about this?
Answer: it sounds like you're going to have to pay more for insurance if you buy a plan through the marketplace. the federal government estimates that the average cost of a plan sold through the marketplaces will be about $3 000 less than what you're paying.
Expected Response: you can't know what insurance will cost you personally until you begin shopping or plug your information into a cost calculator like the one provided by webmd: <link>. if you're currently paying for cobra it's quite likely a plan purchased through the exchange will cost less. the notion that a health plan for two people will cost $2 200 or $3 300 per month sounds highly unlikely. if you qualify for a subsidy your costs will be significantly lower. start shopping on healthcare. gov and see for yourself what your options are.

Answer: hi just google natural ways out of high blood pressure you find lots of info on natural ways to help your blood pressure. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i guess a better question is: are you self-medicating with lorazepam? are you in a job classification (such as cdl driver) in which you're not supposed to be taking lorazepam? because otherwise why are you concerned about it showing up on a drug test? if you don't have a valid prescription for lorazepam you shouldn't be taking it. no one should self-medicate with a prescription drug. likewise if you're in a job that prohibits the use of certain substances you shouldn't be using them. doing so exhibits a reckless disregard for the safety of yourself and others. if you have anxiety or sleep problems see a doctor for a help. if you have a substance abuse problem please seek appropriate treatment.

Question: how long should you wait to cast a broken ankle? is 8 days too long? . my 16 yr old son broke his ankle and the doctor waited 8 days for swelling to go down and on the 8th day follow up he said he needs a plate put it. is it because he wasnt casted?
Answer: if your son is 8 weeks old and has not been casted then it is not likely that he will need surgery. a cast is a procedure to remove a bone from the body. it is the most common cause of broken bones in children. if he is not already in pain then it would be best to wait to see if he has a fracture. if it is a broken bone then you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: not necessarily. we often wait a week or so before casting. if you put a snug cast on a freshly-injured area the cast will not fit properly when the swelling goes down and even worse. if the area started to swell more this could compromise the blood flow to the feet/toes. many will put the person in a special boot instead of a cast but that depends on the fracture. there are many types of ankle fracture; some are more stable than others. if your doctor feels that a plate is needed this may be because this fracture is unstable. because the ankle is a weight-bearing joint there are many considerations when it comes to managing these fractures. your son should be totally on crutches with no weight-bearing and hopefully he has not had subsequent injury in the last week since the original fracture was diagnosed (this can happen). a comparison x-ray may be required. hi there is no way we can tell you via the internet whether this treatment was appropriate or not as all injuries and people are different. here is some information on ankle injuries that may be helpful. if you feel like your son's treatment was not taken care of properly you may want to have another doctor examine him in person for a second opinion. the webmd answers staff

Question: is more masturbating effects on sex life like decrease in penis size sprem count down thin sized penis early ejaculatn? . sir i have my penis hard and pretty thick before i used to masturbate regularly. actually my problem is now i used to masturbate more than before like 10 to 15 times a day;i think my penis is now not as thick as before and ejaculation is soo fast and my sperm is also lower than before. is masturbating too much effected my size and sperm count?
Answer: hi do you think its a good idea to use a condom? do you have a penis health test done? do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer masturbation will not change the diameter or overall size of your penis. frequent ejaculation will decrease your sperm volume and sperm count but only temporarily. masturbation is considered safe but if you feel the need to masturbate 15 times per day you need to find another hobby. the most obvious effect is skin damage. i mean thing like chafing dryness soreness and even a loss of sensitivity. these all negatively impact one's sex life so you definitely should use a penis health creme every morning. these are made to protect the penis from masturbation-induced issues. they work very well. i use one called man1 man oil. you should check it out. hope this helps.

Question: can cinnamon help lower cholesterol?
Answer: cinnamon is a great addition to any diet. it's a great source of antioxidants and helps lower cholesterol. it is also a good source of vitamin c which can help lower blood pressure.
Expected Response: in 2003 an in-vivo study was concluded on 60 diabetic candidates in pakistan. the results of this study were released to the western media and a frenzy of cinnamon capsules were sold in the u. s. and other countries promoting cinnamon's lipid-lowering effects. since that time numerous studies in germany and in the netherlands have been published. the result of these studies differs significantly from the original pakistani study. based on the data from these studies it would appear that the early enthusiasm for cinnamon supplementation might have been premature.

Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'd suggest you see a medical professional for a thorough examination. it's possible that you have a "bruised" gallblast. it could be a lump or a bulge in the tube that's blocking your gallbladders. it would be best to see a doctor right away. you should also see a urologist or a urology specialist. you can

Question: can this overwhelming hunger feeling to the point of being nauses be a sign of being pregnante? . this started around 7pm on 6/17/2013 and has not stopped even with food and water. i am not pregnant and i am still experiencing this feeling.
Answer: hi just google hunger and pregnancy and see if it helps you. good luck
Expected Response: sometimes it could also be a sign of bulimia unless you are on a steroid packet or some birth control pills with cause a large amount of hunger try sticking to small meals every two to four hrs and see if that helps you might also want to get checked for bulimia and other things. i know you may think that your not forcing you self to throw up but that's not all bulimia is about. i had a friend of mine that had it and never thought of herself as fat or forced herself to throw up. my x husband would eat so much that his stomach would swell and now he has pancreatitis so you could get that looked at to just to be on the safe side. that can be curable with the right diet and meds.

Question: went for 6 mth mammo after surgery. still need needle biopsy in same place. why wasnt this removed during surgery? . radiologist said there is still a piece at the biopsy site. i dont understand why this wasnt removed during surgery. is it necessary to do this biopsy? i have an appt with my surgeon but not sure how much i trust her now. the biopsy came back negative 6 mths ago.
Answer: hi if you were a man its not so bad but you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: i wish that i could answer your question but to blindly comment on a prior surgery would be impossible since i do not know the medical details of your case. only your surgeon can address this issue. please keep in mind that cancer does not always "stand out" and be obvious during surgery so it is possible that a tiny piece was missed. i really can't say but at least the follow-up mammogram spotted "something". this "something" may not necessarily mean a "piece of cancer" since there can be many artifacts that mimic a suspicious reading. it is up to you to trust your doctor but medicine is far from 100% perfect 100% of the time. i am sure you will receive an explanation from your doctor. i wish you the very best.

Question: my tsh is6. 66 and my t4 is 0. 84 after taking synthyroid 25mcg for 6 months what should i do? . i am a woman and i am currently taking the medication for my tsh. i am also taking the levothyroxine. i have a tsh of 6. 66.
Answer: hi i would ask your doctor for a prescription for your tsh but you can do that at your doctor's office. good luck
Expected Response: your tsh result indicates you still have an underactive thyroid gland despite taking extra thyroid hormone (synthroid). the healthcare provider probably will be in touch with you to adjust your medication dosage. in the meantime you shouldn't do anything. you should never adjust your medications on your own. if you don't hear from the doctor who ordered your recent blood test be sure to call to make a follow-up appointment. the "reference range" for normal tsh values has been the subject of debate in recent years but a tsh level over 6. 0 clearly is high. this indicates the combination of thyroid pills plus the amount of thyroid hormone produced by your own thyroid gland still is low. don't worry. it can take quite some time to fine-tune the dosage of thyroid medication. and while a sluggish thyroid can be a nuisance it's not likely to have any life-threatening effects. wishing you well!

Question: how do i cure stress and anxiety. ive been extremely stressed out over the situation of a girl and ive even had some anxiety come from it. its been going on for a few months on and off more or less and i want to know how to make it stop. i dont know what to do. i cant help myself.
Answer: i think you need to see a mental health professional. i think it's important to talk to your therapist about your anxiety. you can ask for help in your area by calling 1-800-medicine (1-800) 888-4227. you may also ask for some help with medications. if you're experiencing anxiety or depression try to get help from a counselor or therapist.
Expected Response: you can't cure stress or anxiety. there will always be things in our lives that we have no control over. finding ways to cope with it is the struggle.

Answer: you may have to wait until the end of 2014. if you're already covered by your wife's plan you'll be eligible for a subsidy that's based on your income. you'll need to pay the full cost of the plan you buy and then purchase another plan in 2014.

Expected Response: you absolutely can be allergic to iodine! true that most people who are allergic to seafood are allergic to the proteins within but some people as myself have a true reaction to high levels of iodine and it can buildup to a reaction by consuming iodine-rich foods consecutively. yes we need a small amt of iodine for our thyroid to work but people with a true allergy to iodine have to take in the bare minimum and live with daily itching.

Question: my daughter is 18 and for some reason she has been very tired and sluggish but very hungry what could be the problem? . when i cook at home i try and cook healthy food. though with her having a job and a car she has her own money and a way to get a lot of fast food. also since this cycle of hunger and sleepiness has occurred her body has been having pains off and on. are these related and could fast food be the problem?
Answer: i don't know. i have no way of examining your daughter's health or anything about her diet. i can only suggest that you see a medical provider to get her checked out. i hope this helps!
Expected Response: the tiredness and aches and pains could be caused by a variety of factors. i would start with a physical and blood work. it is not uncommon for young women to be iron deficient which could be causing her to be tired. you also want to check her vitamin d levels which can be low even when diet is healthy. as for the pains its hard to tell. fast food daily would be a problem nutritionally but if she eats it less often it may not. some things you can do is talk to her about her food choices when eating out. and make a point to have family meals even if she gets home late let her know the food will be waiting and have one parent eat with her. your daughter is an adult now and it's time for her to take charge of her health. have her help prepare meals understand her nutritional needs and guide her to make good food choices. this article provides more information on diet for teens. good luck!

Question: how can exercise help my sleep?

Expected Response: so exercise and sleep there’s significant amount of data to show that a regular amount of exercise will help with sleep specifically increasing deep sleep. so one of the questions when we talk about working with the boomers and people who are in that age range is that if they can get daily exercise it will actually help increase their overall sleep. do you want to exercise right before bed? well that’s a great question and the data is very mixed on this. i have some patients who are what i call type-a personalities and pretty anxious folks. i actually have them exercising before bed which isn’t something that is usually recommended because for them exercise causes a relaxation response. so for them it’s perfect to exercise before bed. i have other patients people who are a little bit more melancholy and blue where exercise actually gives them energy so these people i have them exercising in the morning. so it really depends upon your overall personality type to know and understand when you should exercise. but overall i definitely recommend exercise for sleep.

Question: what causes back pain in pregnant women? . i'm a pregnant woman and i've been experiencing back pain for about 2 weeks now. i have been experiencing this pain for a few days now and i'm not sure if it's related to my pregnancy. i've tried taking a couple of ibuprofen and it hasn't helped. i'm also having some nausea and a slight headache. i haven't had a period since i was a kid.
Answer: hi its a good idea to get some blood work done at home if your pregnant then just go to your doctor and get a blood test done there its a test done for your hormones. good luck
Expected Response: there are many possible reasons pregnant women may experience back or spinal pain. here are some of the more likely causes: weight gain. during a healthy pregnancy women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. this added weight must be supported by the spine which can result in discomfort in your lower back. further the weight of the growing baby and uterus puts pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back. changes in posture. as your uterus becomes heavier your center of gravity changes. you may gradually -- perhaps without noticing -- begin to adjust your posture and the way you move. this may result in back pain or strain. hormone changes. during pregnancy your body produces a hormone called relaxin that allows ligaments in the pelvic area to relax and the joints to become looser in preparation for the birth process. the same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to loosen leading to instability and pain. muscle separation. as the uterus expands two parallel sheets of muscles (the rectal abdominis muscles) which run from the rib cage to the pubic bone may separate along the center seam. this separation may worsen back pain. stress. emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back which may be felt as back pain or back spasms. you may find that you experience an increase in back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy.

Question: i had sex august 23rd three days before my fertle window can i be pregnant he pulled out and cummed then put back in. he's 12 i'm 13. ? i had my period at 11. when should i take a test?
Answer: hi if you have had unprotected sex and you have been spotting you should be ok but if you think you may have missed your period then you should have your period tested. good luck
Expected Response: yes it is possible you are pregnant. a female of any age is fertile and capable of getting pregnant if she has already had even one period. pulling out only stops the main ejaculation dear there is what is called "pre-ejaculate" that comes out before he has his main ejaculation which happens during orgasm. there can be sperm present in this pre-ejaculate and you can get pregnant from it. pre-ejaculate can come out anytime during sex before he orgasms and ejaculates fully. i'm not gonna tear you down and tell you what a bad girl you've been. you made a choice and now you have to figure it out. it's extremely important that you do the following two things. first you need to see a doctor. even if this boy says he has never had sex with anyone else he could be lying. people lie. boys lie even more frequently when sex is added to the equation. so you need to see a doctor and get an std test. std's just sounds like a scary word but we're talking about possibly life-threatening diseases that can kill you if left untreated. not to mention you could accidentally give them to someone else and hurt them. second you need to take precautions if you are going to continue to be sexually active. there is no excuse for a boy not to show up with condoms. if your boyfriend shows up without several condoms knowing full well you are going to have sex then you need to turn him away at the door and tell him to come back when he has some condoms. if he really cares about you he'll find a way to get some. they give them away for free all over the country. it's not hard. and you can go ahead and let him be responsible for that. it's his sperm that'll be causing any problems so he needs to get himself in order if he wants the privilege of your company. i'm sad that i have to tell you this but this is the world in which we live: you never let a boy con you or manipulate you into unprotected sex. and they will try. they will try every day until they realize you won't stop saying no. you must be responsible for your own body because no one else will be.

Question: what if i am unemployed? do i have to get insurance or am i exempt?
Answer: you can shop for a plan through your state's marketplace. if you are eligible for medicaid you will be eligible for a tax credit. if your income is too low to qualify for medicare you will qualify for a subsidy. if income is low enough to qualify you will have to pay a penalty.
Expected Response: if you're unemployed and can't find a health plan that you can afford (one that costs no more than 8% of your income) you will be exempt. however the good news is that as someone without an income you'll qualify for steep subsidies to dramatically lower the cost of insurance. and if you live in a state expanding its medicaid program you may qualify for that as well which will provide you with insurance at no cost.

Question: what causes celiac disease?
Answer: celiac is a disease of the small intestine. it is caused by a fungus called the "lactobacillus" which is found in the intestines of people with celiac. it can also be caused by an overgrowth of the intestinal bacteria called "lactic acidosis" or "lice". celiac causes a lot of inflammation and inflammation of the lining of the intestine. the lining is the lining that connects the small intestines to the larger intestine. a person with celic disease may have a lot more of the inflammation of a common cold than a person without celiac disorder. the inflammation may also cause the lining to become inflamed. inflammation of this lining can cause the intestine lining to be inflamed and break open. in addition to the inflammation the lining may also become inflasted and hard to swallow.
Expected Response: the destruction of the inner lining of the small intestine in celiac disease is caused by an immunological (allergic) reaction to gluten in the diet that inflames and destroys the inner lining of the small intestine. there is evidence that this reaction is partially genetic and inherited. thus approximately 10% of first-degree relatives (parents siblings or children) of individuals with celiac disease also will have celiac disease. in addition in approximately 30% of fraternal twins and 70% of identical twins both twins will have celiac disease. finally certain genes have been found to be more common among individuals with celiac disease than among individuals without celiac disease. gluten is a family of proteins present in wheat. some of the proteins that make up gluten (the ones that are dissolved by alcohol) are called gliadin. it is the gliadin in gluten that causes the immunological reaction in celiac disease. the mechanism whereby gliadin becomes toxic (damaging) is not clear; however much scientific study is being done and we are beginning to understand the mechanism. proteins including gliadin are long chains of amino acids-up to several hundred--attached to each other. normally during digestion digestive enzymes within the small intestine break-up proteins into single amino acids and smaller chains of amino acids. this is necessary because the intestine only can absorb single amino acids or at most chains of 3-4 amino acids. single amino acids and chains of several amino acids do not cause problems for the intestine. it appears however that gliadin is not completely broken-up by intestinal enzymes. several longer chains of amino acids remain intact. somehow these larger chains enter the cells lining the intestine perhaps because the cells are abnormally permeable (leaky) to longer chains of amino acids. some of these longer chains are toxic (damaging) to the intestinal cells. one of the longer chains attaches to an enzyme within the cells tissue transglutaminase. in individuals with celiac disease the complex of the longer chain of amino acids and tissue transglutaminase sets off an immune reaction that attacks the complex and at the same time damages the intestinal cells. barley and rye contain gliadin-like proteins and can cause celiac disease in genetically-predisposed individuals. oats also contain gliadin-like proteins but unlike barley and rye the gliadin-like proteins in oats cause inflammation weakly and in only a few individuals who are predisposed to develop celiac disease. rice and corn do not cause celiac disease because they do not contain gliadin-like proteins.

Question: i have a shooting pain on the side of my face. ibuprofen has not helped. what do you suggest?
Answer: ibuprophen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) that is used to treat inflammation. it is used for pain management and to treat pain associated with arthritis. it may be used to relieve pain in people with arthritis or to relieve symptoms of arthritis such as muscle pain or swelling. it does not work as well as ibuprocodone and does not relieve pain caused by other pain medications. it can be used for other conditions such as asthma or other conditions that may be associated with pain. it should be used only for the specific symptoms you describe. if you have any questions about using this product or any other product that is not listed on this product's product label ask your pharmacist. you can also ask your health care provider if you are taking any of the following medications: pain relievers such as ibs or nap
Expected Response: due to the fact that you have tried ibuprofen and that did not seem to help i am concerned with the level of pain that you are having and the area that you are having it in and strongly suggest that you see a health care provider for further evaluation. it could be a sign of an infection and it is very important that you have this looked at. thanks for submitting a question today.

Answer: hi your find that if you are pregnant the next day you get a period on the 4th then it should come on the 5th then you get your period on that day then you should get it on the 7th then your ovulation day. if you get pregnant the last day of your period is the day you ovulate. if your pregnant the day after your period. the day that you ovulated. is the best time to get pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi your talking about ovulation day which is around day 14 in your cycle day 1 being the first day of your last period. so for most women your in the so called sage period for having unprotected sex and here's the but but some women can get pregnant from having unprotected sex any time during there cycle even during there period ok the only time you could tell if you pregnant is if you have some spotting around day 21 apart from that its if you miss your period just wait a week then go get tested. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: how should someone stop taking xanax? what is the proper way so that they don't experience all of the hardcore symptoms.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are experiencing this. xanex is not a drug that is "safe" to take. it is a prescription medication that is not 100% effective. i would suggest you see your health care provider or pharmacist to find out what is wrong with you. i do not know your medical history or the type of drug you are taking or how long you have been taking it. i am not a doctor but i can tell you that you need to stop taking the medication for a few days. it can be difficult to find a good reason to stop the medication. you need help.
Expected Response: unfortunately i do not know how much xanax you are taking. how long you have been taking it. or the reason you are using this sedative drug. you will need to discuss this with the medical professional who is prescribing it to you -- someone who knows you and your particular case. many people will start reducing the amount they are taking. cutting the pills in half for instance but again i am reluctant to advise you in this matter due to the lack of specifics. i am confident that your medical provider will help you.

Question: is it safe to take inderal topamax imitrex hydrocodone limbitrol and yaz birth control for my migraines?
Answer: hi just google inderal and topamox for migraine and you will find lots of info on this drug. good luck
Expected Response: it is not uncommon to take birth control to help regulate hormone cycles preventative medications to prevent the onset of a migraine (topamax inderal limbitrol) and symptomatic relief medications (imitrex) all together. hydrocodone basically covers up the pain. to take three preventative medications along with everything else you listed does seem like a bit much. i would look at lifestyle modifications that you could possibly make in order to aid in the decrease of migraine frequency. i would also seek another medical opinion from a migraine specialist or neurologist to see if all these medications are necessary. keep in mind that a few of these medications have side effects of headaches which could be a trigger to worsen or cause your migraines.

Question: is it safe to feed meat and yogurt to my 9-month-old?
Answer: yes. it is safe to eat meat and dairy products.
Expected Response: i generally recommend that my patients start introducing proteins (such as meat and dairy) at about 7 months -- assuming that there are no dairy allergies/intolerances. full fat dairy is what we usually recommend until age two years. meats such as beef and poultry are usually well tolerated. the proteins to stay away from until one year of age are: fish seafood egg whites and nuts. each pediatrician tends to offer different advice as to when to introduce these "allergenic" proteins so please ask your doctor about his/her preferences.

Question: i have a small cluster of white/yellow bumbs on the base of my penis. what could this be. i have as mall area at the base of my penis where my or is and pubic area are. the bumbs came in almost clear with some type of liquid inside and now have turned a slight yellow color any ideas as to what this might be again they are not on the shaft or anywhere else just on the pubic area almost making contact with the shaft. i am very concerned.
Answer: hi see this link from the uk's nhs its a good place to start. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: a description no matter how specific is not sufficient to make a "blind diagnosis" of this skin condition. as much as i would like to help you you will need to physically see a medical professional so you can be properly examined/diagnosed and perhaps have this skin condition lab-tested. there are many things that can cause the bumps you are trying to describe and it would not be prudent to just guess based solely on the information in your posting.

Answer: hi i think you should take a look at the link above and read through it. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck

Question: i have a stubborn keloid since giving birth to 2 daughters via cesarean 20 yrs ago. still growing & causing inflammation. i'm very concerned. i had a very bad keloids for about 2 years. i was given a cesarenan to help with the inflammation. it's been going on for about a year now. i've had a bad kelenoid for about 4 years.
Answer: hi if you are having a keloidal cyst then you need to see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear this. many people think a keloid is just a large unattractive scar. they don't realize the pain a keloid can cause. i'd suggest you consult a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. he or she will be able to assess your keloid and provide you with various treatment options from cortisone injections to surgery. of course surgical removal of a keloid can lead to. another keloid. however i've seen good results from the surgical removal of keloids too. at any rate a plastic and reconstructive surgeon will be able to give you all of your options up to an including surgery. you certainly can opt for less aggressive treatment first to see if it will work. i wish you all the best!
================================================================================
Question: what type of exercises are ok after knee and hip replacement?
Answer: hi if you have a problem with your knee then do a knee and hips replacement at your doctor's office or go to the er. good luck
Expected Response: we tend to advise our patients to avoid high impact activities following hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. so we do not want people running or jumping if it can be avoided. there really is no consensus opinion about activities following hip and knee replacement. different surgeons will allow different amounts of activity. if a patient of mine wants to do some weight training i tend to advise them to avoid really heavy weights and focus more on "reps". i also tend to tell my patients to try to maintain exercise as they can because i certainly feel that the benefit gained from the exercise likely outweighs the wear seen by the implant. it is certain that you will have less wear if you do not exercise at at all but that will likely come at the expense of your overall health.

Question: what are early warning signs of type-2 diabeties if you are not obese? . i've taking general blood tests but have not been diagnosed with diabetes. i'm wondering if there's any definite signs/symptoms that would show that i'm at risk i'm female 22 yrs old white weight 135 at 5'7". my grandmother has type 2 diabetes.
Answer: hi try this link from the uk’s nhs you should find it very interesting. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: this is a great question. here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes from the american diabetes association: age over 45 people with family history of diabetes being overweight or obese people who don't exercise regularly people with high blood pressure low hdl (good) cholesterol or high triglyceride level certain racial/ethnic groups (blacks hispanic/latino americans asian americans and pacific islanders american indians alaska natives) women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy or have had a baby born weighing 9 or more pounds people whose fasting glucose (blood sugar) or glucose tolerance tests are impaired- indicating increased risk of developing diabetes <link> you mentioned that one of you family members - your grandmother has type 2 diabetes. there are steps that you can take to help reduce your risk including keeping at a healthy weight eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. it would also be helpful to ask your health care provider how often you should check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels to make sure they are at good levels. take care

Question: had surgery a year ago can not work or stand or move with out pain in stomacke since no medication is working what is it. after 2nd surgery in january 2012 ( adhesion removal) the pain in my stomache is so bad that i can not stand long enough to even do dishes or cook if anything touches my stomache at all the pain is so bad i want to just cry and not stop i can not lay down or sit up on my own can not walk through a store have to get on of those electric wheel chairs the doctors have tried so many treatments from pain pills to ontiment to anti depressants. this has changed my life completely.
Answer: hi its a bit hard to find out what's going on with your stomaches but i think you have a problem with the way your stoms work. the way they work is that your stoma is a thin layer of tissue that surrounds the rest of your body. this means that when
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. have any of your medical providers done an x-ray of your abdomen? if not i suggest you contact your primary health care provider and request one. tell him or her you just want to make sure you're not walking around with a retained instrument or sponge. an x-ray is a cheap fast way to make sure the surgeons left nothing behind by accident. if you've already had an x-ray to confirm there are no foreign bodies in your abdomen then i'd suggest you consult a different doctor for a second opinion on what could be causing this pain. it seems like pain this severe should be attributable to some cause. i'd suggest you press your health care providers to find a cause for this pain. wishing you all the best!

Question: can condoms cause the vaginal area to become red and swollen? . i just had sex for the first time with a condom. afterwards my lower vagina where the penis enters is now red and swollen. i have trouble going to the bathroom because it hurts so bad. i want to know what i can do to fix it without going to the doctor. but if i have to go i understand. tell me what is wrong and what i should do?
Answer: hi its just a matter of time you get your answer from your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: the condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sex. especially for the first time. the redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen (assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time) burning on urination could be "cystitis" irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee (used to be called "honeymoon cystitis" back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex) or even a urinary tract infection. sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area -- and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection. germs can come from fingers mouths (oral sex) as well as a penis. now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adult-like decisions when it comes to your medical care. if you do have a urinary tract infection (burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe) this needs to be medically evaluated. a urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information. a pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosis. only a simple urine test. my suggestion would be for you to get checked. just in case. women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not. obviously infections are more common if you do have sex. i am pleased that you and your partner used a condom. make sure you use them 100% of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems.

Question: will gonorrhea go away without treatment? how long does it last? . my partner tested positive for gonorrhea and chlamydia about a month ago. i am negative. he claims he contracted it from an affair 6 years ago and was never treated. is this possible?
Answer: hi its a good idea to get tested before you get any of these problems and get tested again if you get the chlamydial disease or chlamodilapine. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: gonorrhea is less like to go away without treatment. it is better to visit venereal disease expert and get treated. if left untreated recurrence of symptoms is very common.

Question: can i continue my flat abs workout when planning for pregnancy? what kind of exercises i shld avoid? . i had an ectopic pregnancy on june 2011. i have had a flat abs exercise for a week now. i'm not sure if i should continue my exercise or not. i am trying to figure out what exercises i should avoid.
Answer: i would recommend that you see your gynecologist for a pelvic exam to rule out any possible pelvic issues. if you are having pelvic pain or have any other symptoms you should talk to your gynecomastian. it is important to keep in mind that your pelvic pain may be related to an ectomegaly. it may be a sign of an infection or a pelvic inflammatory disease. if your pelvic symptoms persist you may want to see your doctor for a consultation.
Expected Response: you aren't supposed to do any floor abs lying on your back after your first trimester. there is a great quiz on here about exercising & pregnancy you can take that is very informative & also touches on that question <positive_smiley>

Question: would it be possible to get a allergy test to see what my daughter is allergic too without knowing what it is. doctor keeps telling me she needs to know what my daughter is having a reaction to first but i would much prefer if she could have test done to see what my daughter is allergic too. is there a test out there that can do that without knowing what the allergy is?
Answer: i would suggest that you see your doctor first. it is important that you have a thorough medical history so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated. it can be difficult to tell what is causing an allergy without a physical examination. it could be a cold sore or a sore throat. i would also suggest that she see a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis.
Expected Response: hi some symptoms would really help us to help you they kept giving my son stuff till they sent him off for a skin test now that was in the uk. so have just no idea how it works in the us do have to do it private? if so just get one done but they will need to know what things you use that may be causing her problem. good luck

Question: i am full time college student want to lose some weight been having anxiety attacks. is it still okay to exercise? . when i told my parents about it my mom asked me if i am getting enough air through my ribs. i did not know. . . the best discriptions to descripe what i was feeling is that it felt like my ribs are crushing in me. . . i am way over weight and want to have a better lifestyle and start exercising. . i am wondering if it would be okay to exercise consider my past with anxiety attacks. . . my record of anxiety attacks counts as 4 or 5 from august to december. .
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's difficult to say what you're feeling without doing a physical exam. there are a number of factors that can cause anxiety attacks including: stress. anxiety attacks can be caused by stress. stress can be a sign of anxiety. stress may be a symptom of anxiety
Expected Response: hello jean13. it's very good that you can reach out and talk about your issues. if you are way overweight then yes exercise is always recommended. but not always necessary in 2011 i was able to lose 70 lbs in less than 5 months by doing no exercise. a life changing experience helped me to learn the secret to weight loss and how to look at life for what it is. losing weight has to do with working less not working more. depending on how overweight you are you might not want to put too much pressure on a body that's already struggling with an amount of weight that's too much for your frame. losing weight is 100% mental. if you're mentally in it the body will follow and do its thing as long as you understand to get out of your own way. i also suffered from anxiety and depression. i beat the hell out it though. i had to take 47 pills a week. my condition got worse and worse. losing weight is about becoming aware of what you are not who you are or what others are saying or doing or what your occupation is. your body doesn't understand that stuff. trust me. i speak from experience not just reciting something i got off the internet tv or some crap story in the tabloids. i just got finished losing 15 lbs in a week and a half. no problem. i'm telling you that you're much more powerful than you think and much more powerful than you've been taught in school on tv in magazines or even in church. the greatest dietary supplements and pharmacy on the planet is already in you. it's just waiting for you to throw the switches. you are divine. know it! you are a product of nature not something that's owned by a corporation. be your own president. i'm always here if you need anything answered or just need to talk. i would like to know how much you weigh or how much you need to lose if you don't mind. keep your head up and have a glorious logical day!

Expected Response: hi try this below its a post of mine this should really help you as it will clean you blood up plaque build up will do this to you. and this will help you kick out both drugs. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonfuls each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. don’t forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on. one last piece of info some cp i got out here in greece was not very hot so changed shops and using a 50/50 mix of cp and chilli powder this i put a heaped teaspoon on top each day along with a heaped teaspoon of turmeric now from a site i’m on they say to help turmeric get absorbed to take a ¼ teaspoon of black pepper with it what a great way to light a fire in your stomach to get the day started.

Question: when signing up for health insurance in the exchange what happens to families with mixed eligibility?
Answer: if you qualify for medicaid you'll qualify for a tax credit to help pay for your premium. you'll also be able to apply for a subsidy to help lower your costs.
Expected Response: one of the most important aspects of the state insurance exchange is that there is “no wrong door” to find appropriate coverage. when you apply your application will determine your family’s eligibility for medicaid chip and exchange subsidies. states determine eligibility for medicaid based on household income. if you qualify for medicaid in your state you cannot qualify for a subsidy on the exchange. subsidy eligibility on the health insurance exchanges depends upon your household income and its relation to the federal poverty level (fpl). if your household earns between 100-400 percent of the fpl that corresponds to the size of your family you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange. for a single person in 2013 the 100-400 percent fpl income range is $11 490 to $45 960. in some cases for example children may qualify for chip whereas the parents qualify for exchange subsidies. in all cases your state health insurance exchange should lead you to the “right door” for coverage.

Question: painful 1 inch swelling between anus and scrotum not a pimple under the skin gives me fever help? . hi . i have a swelling between my scrotum and anus closer to the scrotum . it's size has increased in the last two days . i have had it for 4 days now it's excruciatingly painful. i have no idea what it is and what to do. . plus it gives me fever so i have taken small doses of paracetamol . it's still somewhat manageable if its kept warm. can you please tell what is it and how can i get better? ways to treat it? . any help would be really really appreciated! . thank you!
Answer: hi its best you just go see your doctor and get checked out. good luck
Expected Response: what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about 2 capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you

Question: im late on my period could i be pregnant? . i hooked up with a guy the day after my period ended and now im 4 days late on this moths period. i gave him a blowjob and he came in my mouth then we were going to have sex with a condom on but he couldnt get hard again so i gave him another blowjob with the condom on and then he put it in. we ended up not having sex but his penis touched my vagina. is it possible that the residue of cum from my mouth passed onto the condom when i gave him a blowjob with it on could get me pregnant?
Answer: hi ok so you have been on the bc pill for a couple of weeks now and you have not had sex yet then you could be pregnant but if you did then you will have to wait a bit longer then you should have had sex on the day you got your period. but if its been a couple days then you are safe. good luck
Expected Response: hi it could be possible but sperm that's been in your mouth the acids in your mouth could kill it but then this was straight after your period? but then chuck in that some women can get pregnant from anytime of the month its a bit of a mine field. just one last thing have you done an hpt? or had a doctor do a pregnancy test? or it could be just a skipped period it does happen. things to think about. good luck
================================================================================
Question: how can i build white blood cells with food?
Answer: hi it would be best to get a blood test done to see if you can get white blood cell count from eating a lot of food. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.

Question: my hgba1c is 9. 1 fbs is 92. is this indicative of diabetes? . my vit d was also low so my doctor has prescribed me something for that. i'm not sure if the vit d can alter the hgba1c. i have all the symptoms of diabetes and a strong family history. i also have an autoimmune disorder (not sure if it's ra or lupus yet). i'm wondering if this is a sign of diabetes.
Answer: hi if you have a high blood sugar then you have diabetes. if you are on the low side then you should be ok but if you do have a strong history of diabetes then you may need to see your doctor for a blood test. good luck
Expected Response: yes

Question: is it true that you shouldn't take medicines with milk?
Answer: there is no such thing as "milk-free" milk. it is a product that contains the active ingredients of milk. the active ingredient is lactose which is the active component of milk that is used to make milk.
Expected Response: most medications work best if taken with water. there are certain foods that can affect the absorption of medication. it is important to ask your pharmacist about taking medication with or without food with every new prescription you begin.

Question: is it safe to take hydroco 5/325 and. 5mg xanax? . i was in an auto accident and broke my ankle/foot wrist and had internal abdomonal injuries and was prescribed hydroco 5/325 for pain. i also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and have been taking. 5 mg of alprazolam per day. are these two medications safe to take at the same time? i take 1 hydroco 5/325 tablet every 4-6 hours for pain and take. 5mg alprazolam per day. i have been on the flu for 2 years and have never had an allergic reaction to it. i am also taking. 3. 5% alpra for anxiety. is this safe to use?
Answer: it is safe to have a prescription for hydroco and alprapolam. they are both very similar and the drug is not as effective as the generic. i would advise you to see your health care provider
Expected Response: i'm glad you asked because many others will benefit. you should be just fine taking this combination of medications. you may feel drowsier than normal. and anyone who is taking a narcotic (hydrocodone) should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions. in general though you're not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages. in the future i'd recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time you're prescribed a narcotic. also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice. i hope your ankle heals quickly! it is definitely safe. you want to be careful to see how they interact with each other at a time when you can lay down if necessary. i take four 1 mg xanax a day and two 7. 5/325 mg of norco (hydrocodone) everyday. make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications.

Question: what is the treatment for emphysema?
Answer: emphysis means that the fluid in the lungs is too thick to pass through the body. it is usually caused by a blockage of the lung wall. this blockage can cause the fluid to leak through the lungs and into the bloodstream. if you have emphysesma you may need to see your doctor for a blood test to see if your lungs are functioning properly.
Expected Response: emphysema is not a curable disease. once lung damage has occurred it cannot be reversed. the goal of treatment is to stop further lung destruction and preserve lung function. the patient needs to know that the focus is on improving quality of life and limiting the intrusion of emphysema on daily activities.

Question: i had unprotected sex and after 2 days my virgina started itchying its now a week and it itches only at nyt shud i worry i should have had it
Answer: hi this is from the uk’s nhs this is the u. k’d male contraceptive pill. the pill is made from a combination of two hormones which means it is designed to prevent pregnancy. the first hormone is the progestin which is a hormone that is produced when a woman’ses ovaries are ovulating. the second hormone is a progestogen which is produced during ovulation. the progesterone is a substance that helps regulate the levels of a hormone called a progesterol which is what makes the pill effective. the women taking the pill have a higher risk of getting pregnant if they take too much of the progergen. the hormones that make the pill work differently in different ways and the women who take the pill may have a different effect on
Expected Response: you should always be concerned when you have unprotected sex. the risk of an std is not worth the worry so why not just use condoms and protect yourself? your symptoms could indicate a yeast infection since itching is a primary symptom but there is really no way of knowing if you have contracted other stds unless you were properly examined and tested. it is sooooo much easier to use condoms.
================================================================================
Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for genital herpes?
Answer: you can use a variety of tests to evaluate a person for genital warts. you can also use a blood test to determine if a person has herpes. a urine test can detect the virus in the urine. a blood sample can also detect the herpes virus in a blood specimen. a culture kit can detect herpes virus. a lab test can tell if a human papillomavirus (hpv) virus has been present in the blood.
Expected Response: genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on your medical history and a physical exam. your doctor may ask you the following questions: do you think you were exposed to genital herpes or another sexually transmitted disease ( std )? how do you know? did your partner tell you? what are your symptoms? do you have sores in the genital area or anywhere else on your body? do they usually come and go? do you have any urinary symptoms including frequent urination burning or stinging with urination or urinating in small amounts? if you have discharge from the vagina or penis it is important to note any smell or color. what method of birth control do you use? did you use condoms to protect against stds? which high-risk sexual behaviors do you or your partner engage in? have you had an std in the past? how was it treated? after the medical history is taken: a woman will have a gynecological exam. a pap test is not specific for genital herpes but may be included depending on the woman's medical history. a man will have a genital exam to check for hsv infection. your doctor may be able to diagnose genital herpes from your medical history and physical exam especially if the herpes sores are typical in appearance. but if this is your first outbreak of suspected genital herpes further testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis. herpes tests cannot always show if you have a primary genital herpes outbreak or you have been infected in the past. sometimes a test result can be negative even though the person has herpes. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how do doctors determine where a pulmonary embolism came from? . my sister died during a pregnancy from a pulmonary embolism. the autopsy determined the clot came from the femoral vein. . i am in human body and disease class and the topic that i picked from the hat was "pulmonary embolism. i am going to use part of my sister's autopsy in my research paper. that is why i need to know how the medical examiner was able to make the determination of where the embolism came from. . thank you for your help. . radar
Answer: hi the answer is this it is a very simple test that will tell you if you have a pulmonary artery emboloma. it is very simple to do and it is done by a cardiologist. but if you do have a lung problem then you will need to see your doctor. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i am so very sorry to hear about the loss of your sister and her baby. my condolences to you and your entire family. i admire your willingness to write a paper on the very topic that took your sister's life. i think that takes a lot of strength and courage. to answer your question. a pulmonary embolism is caused when all or part of a blood clot breaks loose in a vein travels to the lungs and blocks a major artery there. usually a small part of a much larger clot (or " thrombus ") breaks off and causes the embolism. we know these large clots usually occur in leg veins so the medical examiner probably opened up the femoral vein and saw the remaining portion of the large clot still residing within the vein. that is how he or she knew where the clot came from. in a living person it can sometimes be impossible to determine where an embolism-causing clot came from. many people with blood clots in their legs have no symptoms. i hope you find this answer useful. good luck with your paper!

Answer: hi just google natural ways out of cancer and how to get rid of it. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: i would advise you to ask the doctor. honestly you have a completely valid question there and the doctor not only will give you advice specific to your situation but may change the method of wound closure to accommodate your needs if he knows this in advance. there's no way to estimate whether or not it will be safe for you to have sex a week after your surgery because many different factors come into play: the exact location of the mole the size of the incision condom usage etc. please don't feel shy about asking your doctor about this. trust me he will take your question seriously. wishing you well!

Question: can a penile fungal infection remain in underwear and cause constant reinfection? . have been dealing with some sort of irritation for months on the tip of my penis that i can not find the cause for. have tried antibiotics antifungals and almost everything else (have seen many doctors). one doctor suggested i buy all new underwear as well as use an antifungal as it may be fungal but i keep getting reinfected from my tainted underwear. is this possible?
Answer: hi ok so the penis is in a tight spot and you have been having a hard time getting rid of it the only thing you can do is get a penis health test done at your doctors office. good luck
Expected Response: i would not agree that properly washed underwear would likely retain any fungus residuals. fungus can exist just about everywhere in the home - especially in warm dark or moist areas. finding the one source or sources may be difficult. have you seen a dermatologist? if not this would be recommended. have you tried using man1 man oil? it contains several antibacterial vitamins and nutrients that help with infection and other skin issues down there. simply rub it into your penis skin and let it do the work. it's all natural too so no side effects. you can get it online. hope this helps.

Answer: there is no evidence that a low-fat diet will reduce plaque in arteries. plaque is a very complex protein. plaque can be formed from many different sources including foods and supplements. it is important to avoid foods that are high in saturated fats such as saturated fat and trans fats. this can increase the risk of plaque formation. the best way to prevent atherosclerosis is to avoid certain foods that may increase plaque. these include: high-fat dairy products such as yogurt and yogurt-flavored products such yogurt-

Question: 62 yrs. old. having tenderness around my nipple when clothes rub against it; some pain in whole breast. not pregnant. post-menopausal so no periods or pregnancy. it this something to be concerned about? been going on for about 2 months. only happening in one breast.
Answer: hi if you have had unprotected sex then yes you could be pregnant. but if you do not have any symptoms then you may just have a problem. good luck
Expected Response: in all probability what you're experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer. that said the full answer is a bit more complicated. the fact you're having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag. i'd suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated. obviously you don't want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin. even if you've had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated. with luck it will turn out to be something simple but you'll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this. good luck to you!

Question: who is at risk for prostate cancer?
Answer: hi do you have a good read through this link its from this link just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: an important risk factor is age; more than 70 percent of men diagnosed with this disease are over the age of 65. african american men have a substantially higher risk of prostate cancer than white men including hispanic men. dramatic differences in the incidence of prostate cancer are also seen in different populations around the world. there is some evidence that dietary factors are involved such as vitamin e and selenium which may have a protective effect. genetic factors also appear to play a role particularly for families in which the diagnosis is made in men under age 60. the risk of prostate cancer rises with the number of close relatives who have the disease.

Question: i was diagnosed with acute pharyngitis and came home haven't been able to eat barely drink feel ill. is this normal? . i was perscribed motrin 600 mg and zithromax for it and i took some of each at the emergency room. pretty much immediately started feeling nauseous wanted to throw up went back and she told me that i needed to eat food with it. went home and had a little food but later vomited anyway. had diarrea chest pains stomache pains woke up twice with extreme waves of anxiety the second time i threw up. i haven't been able to keep food down and am trying desperately to keep water down. is this ok?
Answer: hi i think you should see your doctor and get some tests done. good luck
Expected Response: it is normal to feel sick for a day or two when you have acute pharyngitis. the nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick. try to eat something if you can -- anything. but if you can't keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know. you don't want to become dehydrated. also if you're not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call. several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so that's something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on.

Question: what are viral hemorrhagic fevers?
Answer: viral hemorrhages are a common cause of hemorrhagic fever. they are caused by viruses and are often caused by bacteria. viral hemorrhage is a common symptom of viral hemorrhagia.
Expected Response: viral hemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. in general the term "viral hemorrhagic fever" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). characteristically the overall vascular system is damaged and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. these symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. while some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses many of these viruses cause severe life-threatening disease.

Question: ii had a colonoscopy recently and a non-malignant precancerous polyp was found. do i have cancer in the early stages?
Answer: yes. cancer is a very common disease in the colon. it can be caused by many different things. it is not contagious. it may be caused from bacteria or viruses. it also can be related to an infection. it's not a good idea to have a colonoscope in the first place.
Expected Response: the biggest thing. is that the pathology is non-malignant. the main questions to ask your physician if you have not already would be whether he feels as though he got it all. additionally it might be worth asking if there was any dysplasia in the specimen. (dysplasia just means that the cells look "funny" like they are changing in some way. ) asking these questions might allow you to have a bit more of a discussion with your physician so that you could feel better about the plan. .

Answer: hi google vaginal yeast infections and vaginal yeast it should give you some help. good luck
Expected Response: the batteries in a vibrator are "dry cells" so it does not have any acid like a car battery. without an examination a clinician cannot be sure but i suspect that your vaginal infection/irritation is more likely to be the cause. see your gynecologist so that you can be properly examined and treated and i am confident that this issue can be solved.

Question: how is paget's disease diagnosed?
Answer: paget is a disease of the brain that causes the loss of the ability to move the limbs. it is often treated with drugs and medications. the treatment for paget usually consists of a combination of medications. paget can be treated with a combination drug regimen. if you are taking medications that are not working for pagetta you may be able to get paget from your doctor. pagette's disease can be very serious. it can cause severe headaches dizziness and loss of vision. it may also cause severe weakness in the legs. the body can fight paget by using a variety of chemicals called antifungal medicines. these medicines may be used to treat paget. antifulcer medicines are used to stop paget and other forms of cancer. anticoagulant medicines are also used to prevent paget or other forms from spreading. antistatic medicines are medicines that are used for treating other conditions. pagete
Expected Response: paget's disease is diagnosed based on the x-ray appearance. paget's disease might also be detected with other imaging tests such as a bone scan mri scan and ct scan. alkaline phosphatase an enzyme that comes from bone is frequently elevated in the blood of people with paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. this blood test is also referred to as the serum alkaline phosphatase (sap) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of paget's disease. the bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. bone that is affected by paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images.

Question: how long does it take to develop a resistance to an antibiotic?
Answer: the answer to your question is: no. there are no effective antibiotics that can be used to treat the common cold. the cold is caused by viruses. the immune system is able to fight off the infection. the body's defenses work to fight the infection by fighting off the bacteria that cause it. however the immune systems can't fight off an infection like the common flu. the common influenza virus is not a virus. it is a virus that causes the common sore throat. it can be passed on to others by touching someone's skin or by touching a person's clothing. the virus can also be passed from person to person through the skin. if you have the flu or any other viral infection you can get the flu from touching someone else's body.
Expected Response: it depends on how much is being used and how often bacteria are exposed to the drug. it's related to the volume of use and the ability of bacteria to change their coat of armor. it can happen in months; it can happen in weeks or even over a period of years. it usually takes longer for resistance to become widespread but with an increase in travel we can transport bacteria within hours to another location.

Question: how long do dental crowns last?
Answer: crowns are made of plastic and are not made of metal. they are made from a variety of materials. plastic crowns have a strong adhesive coating that allows the tooth to glide over the surface of the tooth. plastic toothbrushes are made to help prevent tooth decay.
Expected Response: on average dental crowns last between 5 and 15 years. the life span of a crown depends on the amount of "wear and tear" the crown is exposed to how well you follow good oral hygiene practices and your personal mouth-related habits (you should avoid such habits as grinding or clenching your teeth chewing ice biting your fingernails and using your teeth to open packaging).
================================================================================
Question: how is the common cold spread?
Answer: the common flu is spread through coughing or sneezing. it is spread by coughing or coughing in the nose or throat. the common influenza virus (common cold) is spread from person to person by direct contact with the respiratory virus.
Expected Response: the common cold is spread either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after individuals sneeze or cough. person-to-person transmission often occurs when an individual who has a cold blows or touches their nose and then touches someone or something else. a healthy individual who then makes direct contact with these secretions can subsequently become infected often after their contaminated hands make contact with their own eyes or nose. a cold virus can live on objects such as pens books telephones computer keyboards and coffee cups for several hours and can thus be acquired from contact with these objects.

Question: can an ovarian cyst grow back? . two years ago i had a 10cm cyst along with my right ovary removed using robotic surgery. i have started to develop the same exact symptoms on my right side that i had two years ago. dull pain in my lower back sometimes a sharp pain just above my groin area. the pain seems to be worse when i wake in the morning. there have been a couple of times that i could hardly lift myself from the bed. then the pain goes away after walking around. . . thanks!
Answer: hi i think you should see your doctor for a test to see if this is your problem. good luck
Expected Response: ovarian cysts tend to form at the time of ovulation and yes new cysts can form as long as you are still ovulating. i would suggest that you see your gynecologist consider an ultrasound. since there can be many other causes to account for your pain this would be a good place to start.

Question: what medication helps to sleep? . i have bipolar schizophrenia and ptsd i have trouble sleeping i'm tired of these anti psychotic meds making me gain weight what are some good medications that will make me relax and fall asleep quickly?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you need to consult a doctor. it's not uncommon for people with bipolar disorder to develop sleep disorders. the good news is you can get help right away by talking to a mental health professional. a psychiatrist can help you get help and help you find the right medication to help you sleep. it may take several months for medication to be effective. however if you're able to find a good psychiatrist who specializes in sleep disorders and can help with your sleep problems talk to him or her about what medications you can take to help manage your sleep. you may also want to look into a sleep aid called a sleep apnea medication. this medication is used to help sleep. if you have a
Expected Response: seroquel and lamictal are both used for schizophrenia and bipolar and have a smaller weight gain potential than many of the other atypical antipsychotics. over the counter melatonin or benadryl can sometimes help a person fall asleep. if that does not work for you hypnotic sedatives like ambien and lunesta can be effective. however these are short-term alternatives and eventually you will have to resolve whatever is causing you to not sleep. good luck!

Expected Response: studies have shown that a low-carb diet can be safe for people with diabetes. however i really don’t like the idea of any diet that severely restricts or eliminates any particular food or food group. it’s just not sustainable and ultimately will most likely leave you discouraged or disappointed. keep in mind that carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for our bodies. so they are critical for maintaining good health. the key is choosing the right kinds of carbohydrates being good carbs with low glycemic index that are less likely to cause quick rises and falls in blood sugar. opt for whole grains brown rice whole-wheat pasta and beans. combine that with lean proteins and fruits and vegetables and you’ll do wonders for your body and your diabetes.

Question: i have an ankle severe ankle sprain unable to walk on it it is red swollen and hot to the touch very painfull why?
Answer: the only way to know for sure is to see your primary care provider. you will need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: well that's a good question. have you had your ankle examined by a health care professional or are you diagnosing this as a sprain on your own? because your symptoms could be caused by a sprain for sure but also by a fracture (break) in the ankle or the leg. so i'd recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to have the ankle examined. your health care provider may want to take an x-ray to make sure nothing is broken. the symptoms you describe can be a normal part of the body's healing process. when we injure tissue the body sends a big healing response to the damaged area. various cells march into action and these can cause the tissue to temporarily become hot and swollen. the pain is caused by nerves that have been irritated or injured. with any injury like the one you're describing we recommend you elevate the injured area and apply ice packs. do not place ice packs directly against the skin; use a towel or something in between. the usual recommendation is 20 minutes of ice then 20 minutes with no ice. however i again want to caution you to get examined by a doctor to make sure you haven't broken or dislocated a bone. so sorry you're hurting! i hope you get some relief soon!

Question: how does an overdose of acetaminophen cause liver injury?
Answer: acetaminosaproamphetamine (tylenol) is a prescription pain medication that is used to treat pain in the liver. it is not a pain medication. it may be helpful in treating pain in other areas of the body such as the legs or arms.
Expected Response: the answer is that liver damage from acetaminophen occurs when the glutathione pathway is overwhelmed by too much of acetaminophen's metabolite napqi. then this toxic compound accumulates in the liver and causes the damage. furthermore alcohol and certain medications such as phenobarbital phenytoin (dilantin) or carbamazepine (tegretol) (anti-seizure medications) or isoniazid (inh nydrazid laniazid) an anti-tuberculosis drug can significantly increase the damage. they do this by making the cytochrome p-450 system in the liver more active. this increased p-450 activity results in an increased formation of napqi from the acetaminophen. additionally chronic alcohol use as well as the fasting state or poor nutrition can each deplete the liver's glutathione. so alcohol both increases the toxic compound and decreases the detoxifying material. accordingly the bottom line in an acetaminophen overdose is that when the amount of napqi is too much for the available glutathione to detoxify liver damage occurs.

Question: how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?
Answer: hi the answer is no doctors will not find out. but you should get on some kind of bc pill or you could get pregnant from a condom. but it would be best to get tested. good luck
Expected Response: sometimes doctors can find the cause of a couple's infertility by doing a complete fertility evaluation. this process usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories. if there are no obvious problems like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation tests will be needed. for a man doctors usually begin by testing his semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. for a woman the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are several ways to do this at home or doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries. if the woman is ovulating normally more tests are needed. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography: in this test doctors use x-rays to check for physical problems of the uterus and fallopian tubes. laparoscopy: during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.

Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for warts and plantar warts?
Answer: the most important test for a diagnosis is a blood test. the blood test is a diagnostic test that looks for the presence of warts. it is also called a hiatal test. a hct test is an examination of the blood vessels in the lower abdomen. a blood clot in the abdomen can be a sign of wart. a wart can be anywhere from a few small red dots to a large red dot. if a wart is present in the upper abdomen it can be from a small bump or bump of the same size or shape. a bump or lump on the abdomen may be a wart from a common wart. if the wart is on the upper or lower abdomen it is called a wart of the abdomen. if it is on a small area of the body it may be from an infection or other skin condition. if you have a wart that is not on the lower
Expected Response: warts are usually diagnosed based only on their appearance. in rare cases more testing is done. if the diagnosis of a skin condition is unclear or if you are at high risk of having skin cancer your doctor may take a sample of the growth and examine it (a skin biopsy ). a biopsy is usually done if a skin growth is darker than the skin surrounding it appears as an irregular patch on the skin bleeds or is large and growing rapidly. proper diagnosis of plantar warts is important. some wart treatments can cause scarring. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

================================================================================
Question: how can my “attitude” about my bedroom affect my sleep?
Answer: most helpful answer that is not the case. most people do not notice a difference in sleep quality when they sleep in the bedroom. this is because the body makes sleep more comfortable for the person who sleeps in the bed. this means that the bed is more comfortable to you and your sleeping style. the body also makes sleep easier for the baby or child. so if you are in the room and you have a baby or a child sleeping in the crib then your bed is less comfortable for you. if you have an infant or a baby in your bed then you will sleep in your crib. so you may feel better when you sleep in a crib.
Expected Response: your brain actually can train you to have specific emotional feelings surrounding a room in the house. and the bedroom you have to remember is a very private place but it’s also a safety issue so for example in cases where women have been raped or beaten they get almost phobic usually occurring in the bedroom almost phobic to the bedroom. alright i’ve worked with women in rape crisis centers before and they are afraid to go to sleep okay because of the things that happened to them during their sleep. so again can it happen? absolutely it can. can you get a bit milder case where we don’t have such extreme horrible circumstances can people argue in bed and get used to arguing in bed. you know what i tell people don’t have big emotional discussions in your bed if you can help it. don’t talk about your kids in bed don’t talk about your bills in bed. reserve the bed for sleep sex if you can and you know maybe evening watching a little tv reading things of that nature.

Answer: hi ok you could have had your appendix removed but now its not a big deal. just put it away and get to your doctor for a test. good luck

Question: my 5 year old son has a fever of around 102 and a racing heartbeat. should i take him to the emergency room? . i have given him fever reducer but it doesn't seem to be working.

Question: are waterproof mascaras harsher on your eyes and eyelashes than normal mascaras?
Answer: the reason is that there are a lot of ingredients in these products that are not in the same category as the ingredients in normal products. so there is a lot more that you can use in your product. you can also use them in the shower or on the floor. if you are using a product that is not waterproof and you have a lot less water in your eyes or eyelashes you can add a little bit of water to the product. but if you have more water in the eyes or your eyelashes then you may not be able to use it. so if you want to use the product on the face or the back of your neck then you can try using it on the forehead.

Question: i'm taking vicodin for pain and clindamycin for infection after a tooth extraction. can i add zantac 150 or tums?

Expected Response: both vicodin and clindamycin have side effects like upset stomach nausea and vomiting but not heartburn. these medications currently do not have any known drug interactions with zantac 150 (ranitidine) or tums. he should be fine taking all these products together. however watch his symptoms. if symptoms worsen you may want to seek medical advice to make sure he doesn’t have another condition.

Question: for a herniated disk would accupuncture be helpfull?
Answer: acupuncture is not the same as a spinal fusion. the acupuncturist can perform a spinal compression procedure in which the patient is placed in a chair and placed on a spinal cord. the patient can then be placed on an electric chair or other spinal device to be used as a stabilizer. the spinal cord is connected to the spinal fluid by a series of nerves. the nerves in the spinal canal are connected to each other by a needle.
Expected Response: acupuncture will not cure a herniated disk but some people feel that it can help with pain management. it is really your decision since there are few if any scientific studies that prove acupuncture is beneficial for this type of medical condition.

Question: i am 45 and had my right fallopian tube removed due to multiple ectopic pregnancies is it possible to get pregnant. how often will i ovulate with only one fallopian tube?
Answer: hi yes you can get pregnant from a fallopian fallopian tubes but you need to get to the bottom of this you should find out the answer below. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer hi found you this on barycentre. com it could help or not? you ovulate from both sides if you have both ovaries. usually one side one month the other side the next but sometimes an ovary is the dominate ovary and does more then 50-50 (so you can't judge which side you'll ovulate on which is what i thought). one ovary could ovulate 8 times a year while the other only does 4 times a year. so if your good tube has the non-dominant ovary you could only get pregnant 4 times a year (or however many times it ovulates a year- from one to 12 times). the opposite tube can catch the egg but it's not likely. i only have one tube and conceived my son the first month we were trying. and from what i can read also seems that the right one is the more dominant one of the two which would not help you. you would just have to track your ovulation dates and make sure you have unprotected sex 4 days before reason its takes male sperm 3 days to get into the right place to receive your egg so 4 days means there sitting there waiting and sperm can live for up to 5 7 or 10 days depending where you read. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: how often to feed a 5 month old dry cereal?
Answer: the only way to feed your child dry cereal is to feed him cereal with a spoon. there are no special feeding methods for children under 6 months.
Expected Response: please do not feed a 5-month old infant anything besides milk (breast or bottle) yet. the american academy of pediatricians recommends giving an infant milk only for the first six months. and when you do start your baby on cereal we're not talking regular cereal like cheerios. you need to feed your baby soft wet baby cereal. you'll find it in the baby food aisle. not only is your baby's digestive system not ready to handle "dry cereal" at five months of age but giving an infant "dry" anything can be a choking hazard. after your baby is safely taking baby cereal you can begin introducing jarred baby food. introduce just one new food at a time and keep a watch for any allergic reaction. most babies tolerate baby food just fine but if you notice signs of a rash after feeding your infant baby food you should not feed it again until you check with your pediatrician. if you have other questions about how and when to feed your baby please visit the webmd newborn & baby community. you may also want to check out this slideshow on what to feed your baby. (note the slideshow says you can introduce baby food/cereal at 4 months of age but i disagree with that advice. you can't go wrong by waiting. ) wishing you and baby well!

Question: who is at risk for gallstones?
Answer: gallstones are very rare in women. however in women with gallstones there are a few rare cases of gallstones that occur in women as well. gallstones can be caused by a variety of reasons including a genetic or environmental reason. gallstone in women is not common. however the risk of gallstone is very high. it is not uncommon for women to have a small number of gallbladder stones in their lifetime. these stones are often caused by the common bacteria that cause gallstones. gallbladders are located in the lower part of the abdomen. they are located at the base of the neck and are located on the lower sides of the body. gall bladder stones are caused by an abnormal growth of the gallblumen. the growth of gall bladder stone in women can be due to the presence of a small amount of the common bacterium called the bactrim bacterium. the bacterium is found in the blood of people
Expected Response: the risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include: gender. gallstones form more commonly in women than men. age. gallstone prevalence increases with age. obesity. obese people are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. pregnancy. women who have been pregnant are more likely to form gallstones than women who have not been pregnant. pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy bile contains more cholesterol and the gallbladder does not contract normally. birth control pills and hormone therapy the increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. rapid weight loss. rapid weight loss by whatever means very low calorie diets or obesity surgery causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost but many do not. moreover until they are gone they may cause problems. crohn's disease. individuals with crohn's disease of the terminal ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. gallstones form because patients with crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. normally bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body in the terminal ileum and are secreted again by the liver into bile. in other words the bile acids recycle. in crohn's disease the terminal ileum is diseased. bile acids are not absorbed normally the body becomes depleted of bile acids and less bile acids are secreted in bile. there are not enough bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile and gallstones form. increased blood triglycerides. gallstones occur more frequently in people with elevated blood triglyceride levels. risk for pigment gallstones black pigment gallstones form whenever there is an increased load of bilirubin that reaches the liver. this occurs whenever there is increased destruction of red blood cells as there is in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. black pigment gallstones also are more common among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow) for example when there are narrow obstructed bile ducts.

Question: how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me? can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time? . how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair?
Answer: rogaine is a steroid that is used to treat hair loss. it is also used to help with the scalp and scalp combing. propecia is an anti-inflammatory medication that is very effective at reducing hair loss in men. rogaine works by blocking the growth of hair follicles. this means that it is more effective than other hair treatments.
Expected Response: this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there. so i will try to address all of them for you. first of all the sooner you start using the products; whether it's rogaine and/or propecia the better off you are because it's much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards. so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed; whether it's in the temple area or in the crown that's when you start going. the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone. so it doesn't become like one and one is two it's more like one and one is four or five. so they are that much better together. it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them. so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point.

Question: what are the risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse?
Answer: many women are at risk for pelvic organs prolapse due to the effects of hormones like progesterone. progesterones are produced when the lining of the uterus is inflamed. progestogen is produced when a woman's body produces more than its natural amount of estrogen. progerone is produced by the body's own natural production of estrogen called estrogens. progersone is also produced by other hormones like testosterone and progesterol. progsterone is released when the body produces enough of the body’s natural estrogen to make it pregnenol free. progenogen is released from the lining or lining of a woman’d uterus. it is released by the lining that surrounds the uterus. the lining is the outer layer of the uterine wall. it covers the lining where the lining meets the uterus. when the uterus contracts the lining contracts and the lining becomes inflamed or swollen. this is
Expected Response: the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. "stretch marks " you might be thinking "why would that be? " the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks.

Question: how long should sutures remain in face?
Answer: i am not sure how long it will take for the suturing to be effective. it depends on the type of suture you are using. if you are wearing a sutured suture and you are not using a removable suture it is likely that the suture will not be effective at all. if the suts are removable and the sutter is removed you may need to use a suture that is more comfortable and easier to use.
Expected Response: it depends on the location of the laceration and size and complexity of the repair but generally i like to take out the skin sutures in five days if the wound is healing well not infected and the laceration is not in a spot that is under "tension". they can remain in longer but scaring potential increases so many clinicians will remove them at five days and reinforece the wound repair with steri-strips (special adhesive strips) for some additional healing time.

Question: why is a liver biopsy important for managing chronic hepatitis c?
Answer: liver biopsies are very important for controlling liver disease. they are a good way to treat liver disease that may be caused by a variety of conditions such as cirrhosis liver cancer or hepatitis c.
Expected Response: blood tests can tell the clinician whether hepatitis c infection is present but cannot tell the level of liver damage that has occurred. liver biopsy allows the clinician to determine how much inflammation and scarring are present in a small sample of liver tissue. liver biopsy may be recommended when the clinician is uncertain about whether to begin treatment or wishes to monitor the response within the liver to therapy.

Question: what are complications of hypothyroidism?
Answer: hypothyroids are caused by an imbalance of thyroid hormones. these hormones are responsible for making the body's own thyroid hormones such as the thyroid hormone estrogen and the thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh). hypothyrodism is a condition that is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone. the body produces less thyroid hormone than it needs to use to make the body’s own thyroid hormone which is produced in the body.
Expected Response: untreated hypothyroidism may cause: heart problems infertility joint pain obesity thyroid problems in a pregnant woman can affect the developing baby. during the first three months of pregnancy the baby receives all thyroid hormone from its mother. if the mother has hypothyroidism the baby does not get enough thyroid hormone. this can lead to problems with mental development. extremely low levels of thyroid hormone can cause a life-threatening condition called myxedema. myxedema is the most severe form of hypothyroidism. a person with myxedema can lose consciousness or go into a coma. the condition can also cause the body temperature to drop very low which can cause death.

Expected Response: let me share three elements that i’ll bet you didn’t realize impact so significantly upon childhood obesity. . 1. tv in the bedroom: having a tv in the bedroom often leads to sedentary behavior as well as overeating. kids literally go into a trance for hours staring at the tube while mindlessly stuffing their faces with too many calories which includes a large amount of junk. get these tvs out of their bedrooms! 2. not sitting down together for meals: few families sit down together for a meal especially at dinnertime. kids frequently fend for themselves and often take their food to other parts of the house and eat there. how about parents mentor their kids and structure meals such that there’s time to sit and talk and enjoy healthy food together? heck prepare the meal together! it’s such a win-win. 3. not getting enough sleep: sleep deprivation goes hand in hand with the tv in the bedroom along with high-tech toys that are distracting kids 24/7. kids need at least nine hours of sleep. parents need to monitor this and make sure each child is getting enough zzzs.

Question: the two ferrous gluconate tablets i take daily upset my stomach. is there an alternative to get my iron?
Answer: no. iron is not a "natural" substance. it is a chemical compound made from the iron found in the stomach.
Expected Response: iron alone is harsh on the stomach. ferrous sulfate rather than gluconate is more commonly used and in an enteric coating to help decrease the tendencies of upset stomach. take the medication with food. you also can take it twice daily rather than two tablets at once. in addition the slow-absorption iron may aid in decreasing the upset stomach effects.

Question: how is spondylolisthesis and stenosis affected by exercise and what restrictions are necessary?
Answer: spondylethrosis is a condition that occurs when the spondylethrosis of the spongyelin nerve is disrupted by exercise. the sponds are often the result of a ruptured spondule or a rupture of the spinal cord. spondyles are caused by a variety of nerve disorders such as spinal stenosis or spinal stenotic disease. sponds can be caused by any of the following: nerve damage (such as nerve damage from a nerve injury) spinal stenotics (such a nerve damage caused by spinal stenrosis) nerve damage due to surgery or surgery for a spinal stenotosis or nerve damage in the spinal canal (such an injury that causes the spinal stenots to be enlarged) nerve injury due to nerve damage that causes a spinal nerve stenotic defect (such the nerve damage to the spinal nerves is enlarged) spinal injury due in part
Expected Response: spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over an adjacent vertebra. it typically occurs in the lumbar spine and is the result of an injury to or degeneration of one or both of the facet joints of the bone. facet joints help support the weight of the spine and control movement (extension flexion and twisting). symptoms of spondylolisthesis although not present in everyone (it depends on the degree of slippage) can include pain in the low back thighs or legs. pain is due to inflammation of the facet joint or compression impingement or shear forces on a disc. the condition is also associated with muscle spasms weakness and tightness (low back and hamstrings). exercises that emphasize proper body mechanics and stabilize the spine during movements like flexion and extension and stretches for the low back and hamstrings should be prescribed. pelvic tilts abdominal crunches with legs on a chair leg raises (with knees bent and abdominal muscles contracted the bent knee is lifted) and gluteal piriformis and hamstring stretches can all be helpful. proper ergonomics while seated at a desk proper posture while standing and safe lifting technique should all be taught. exercises to avoid are forward bending without the knees bent and abdominals tight bending forward while twisting and any other movement that causes pain. exercises should be individualized depending on the symptoms type and grade of spondylolisthesis. no exercises should be performed if the individual has symptoms and exercises that cause pain should be stopped immediately. you should speak with your client's doctor before you prescribe any exercises and i recommend that you become familiar with the anatomy and biomechanics of the injury as well as the effects of different exercises on the spine.

Question: i have a keloid on my chest but don't know what kind it is and want to get rid of it. i have had this keloid for 8 yrs it has never gotten bigger or smaller it is not that big its about the size of a nipple on a woman's breast a quite small one doesn't hurt or itch really ever hard dark i am african american when i was little i was scratching my chest a lot one day and the next morning a bump appeared and then the bumped turned darker and now it a keloid i guess not sure if i can use something to get rid of it or if i have to get injections surgery ect.
Answer: you may have a type of keloids called a cystic fibrosis (cf) that is caused by a virus. you may also have a cyst called a lupus cyst. the cysts are tiny cysts that are not easily seen. they are usually located in the groin area
Expected Response: most helpful answer keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you. steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you. this is not something you can do at home or with any over-the-counter medications. surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed.

Question: i was diagnosed with chlamydia and am now being tested for all other stis such as hiv. is this routine? . i was called last night by my doctor telling me that i tested + for chlamydia. i was given 1g of zithromax & took it last night. i called this morning to ask when to retest & they told me that i would need to retest for other stds such as hiv what are the chances that i have contracted another more serious sti such as hiv? . i looked up symptoms for hiv & i am not showing any symptoms. in all honesty i am relatively healthy & haven't been showing symptoms for anything - including chlamydia.
Answer: hi yes you should see your doctor asap good luck
Expected Response: other stds can have few if any symptoms early in the disease process. when you get one std from unprotected sex you are more likely to get others. perhaps from the same person/sexual encounter. chlamydia often travels with other "friends". and these friends you do not need. so it is wise to be tested for other common stds. just in case.

Question: what's wrong with me? i have symptoms of paranoid maladptive daydreaming anxiety disorder. i think i'm paranoid i have most symptoms of it i also have this maladaptive daydreaming and usually about sad stories where i always cry i oftenly do lucid dreaming i have anxiety disorder i feel shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat always. i don't know if i am traumatized but i never thought of having suicide never. are these just the effect stress? i thought everytime i'm going crazy already. i wanna know what's wrong with me? thank you for answering and i think i also need advices.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's hard to say what's going on with you without a physical examination. there are many things that can cause anxiety and it's not uncommon for people to get it. anxiety can be a sign of other things too. you may be experiencing anxiety disorders in addition to being depressed or anxious
Expected Response: one of your questions is " are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? " i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not "crazy" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that it’s as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future.

Question: what is teething?
Answer: teethed babies are born with a tiny sac called the teetum. this sac is located in the neck and is the only part of the body that is covered by a thick layer of tissue called the umbilical cord. teethes are born without a teetome. teets are a bit different than babies because they are born in the womb. teetus are born to the mother. teathes are a little different than a baby because they have a little more tissue in the umbile. tees are not a sign of disease. teeching is a sign that you are pregnant. teeming is an abnormal development of teetles. teegs are a tiny part of tees that are not visible to the naked eye. teeter babies are more common in the u. s. teether babies are less common in other parts of the world. teeteetles are more likely to develop in the

Question: why are men's bathrooms so dirty?
Answer: the answer is: it is not. women's toilets are not as dirty as men's. the most common reason for the "dirty" bathroom is because of the way that the water is filtered. the bathroom is a very clean place. it is also very clean. if you are having any issues with your toilet habits you should talk to your doctor.
Expected Response: according to a recent study 85 percent of americans are washing their hands after using a public bathroom; improved from 77 percent a few years ago. the other 15 percent are contaminating the rest of our world. nearly three times as many women wash their hands than men however. apparently men have a prevailing assumption that if you don’t pee on your fingers you don’t need to wash your hands. personally i am not overly worried about the pee-guys but i do worry about the men behind those stall doors. men’s restrooms are considerably nastier than the women’s facilities (so i am told). if i am forced to use a public restroom i try not to touch anything if i can help it. i consider bathrooms stalls the most contaminated rooms on this planet. i would love to put on some type of biological hazard suit but this isn’t practical. i have seen impatient dancing women quickly use a men’s room when the line to the women’s restroom is too long. it only takes one of these experiences to truly appreciate the difference. for the first time i would like to reveal the inner workings of a typical men’s room. there is usually a bank of urinals against one wall about five. men do not like to stand side by side with another man peeing so whenever possible an unused urinal becomes the “buffer. ” some urinals have little walls between them but most are open. there may or may not be a lower urinal for little boys. in the stalls i would be shocked not to find urine on the seat. even though urine is usually sterile no one wants to ever sit on it. men like urinals (sort of) but little boys do not. they are either too short to use them or too shy. given a choice little boys head for the stall where they will freely pee on the seat the floor and the flush handle before finding their mark. i would be shocked not to find sticky urine on the floor near the toilet. men do not like to sit on strange toilets. given the choice they prefer the one at home well-stocked with reading material. unlike women men have not developed the fine art of toilet seat hovering. men are accustomed to sitting down and reading for a while. women typically pee and leave. no one really knows the best toilet stall to use. i guess the best one would be the handicap stall but that isn’t very nice to occupy. most will use the stall most distant from the door however you do tend to select the one that looks the cleanest and has a flushed toilet. if you must use a stall you really don’t want to pick a stall next to an actively occupied one. it can be disconcerting to hear all of those bathroom noises next door or see someone’s shoes tapping out a silent tune. i do witness men washing their hands but a two-second splash of water and maybe a little soap is not thorough hand-washing. (to learn how to do it right watch the webmd video how and when to wash your hands. ) if there are paper towels available men will use them. if there is an electric hand-dryer most will not stand there long enough to get their hands dry. they will them dry on their pants and just leave. restroom doors tend to open inward which means that your clean hands will need to touch a door handle freshly contaminated by the non-handwashers. i usually just hang around long enough for someone to come in and then i will shoot out before the door closes. growing up in appalachia we had outdoor toilets at my junior high. there was no running water to wash your hands. because of this frightening experience i learned to hold it all day if need be rather than use this outhouse. this ability has served me well over the years. unless i am truly desperate i do not use a public restroom. i used to work for an office cleaning company and the women's restrooms were worse. they would not sit on the seats. their pee would spray all over.

Question: what causes smelly feet?
Answer: there are a few common causes of foot foot foot fungus. the most common is a fungus called spermatophilus a. c. b. bordeaux. the fungus is also called anaerobic foot foot. it is a common cause of foot-related foot foot disease. the other common cause is a yeast infection called pedisomycosis. the yeast infection is caused by a fungus that lives in the feet of people who have been exposed to the fungus. this fungus is called anaphylococcus aureus. the bacteria can live in the body for a long time and cause foot foot-like symptoms. it can also cause other conditions such as yeast infections and asthma. the fungi are also called eczema and foot foot eczemias. the foot foot fungi are found in many parts of the world. the main cause of eczeme is a bacterial infection called anhb. the anhc is

Question: can i treat pain from mouth uclers using advil? (ibuprofen). i've been experiencing pain from mouth ulcers for a few days now. and i was just wondering if it was possible to treat the pain with advil and if it would make a difference if i used it or not.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you're dealing with a viral infection. it's impossible to diagnose viral infections without a physical examination. you need to see a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you also need to know if you have any other conditions that could cause the pain you're describing. there are medications that can help treat these conditions but they're not 100% effective. you can take ibuprofin (generic name: ibuprosen) or try other mouth-to-mouth medications like metronidazole (generic: metronadate) or acetaminophen (generic
Expected Response: you can take advil for mouth ulcers (aphthous stomatitis or canker sores). since this medication is anti-inflammatory this can help relieve some of the discomfort until they naturally go away.

Question: what can i expect during week 20 of my pregnancy?
Answer: hi good luck
Expected Response: baby : the fetus measures about 5. 6 to 6. 4 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 9 ounces. your baby can hear sounds by now -- your voice heart and your stomach growling as well as sounds outside your body. it will cover its ears with its hands if a loud sound is made near you and it may even become startled and "jump. " the baby is moving often too -- twisting turning wiggling punching and kicking. mom-to-be : congratulations! you're at about the midpoint of your pregnancy. your uterus is just about even with your navel. your waistline has pretty much disappeared but only temporarily! the risk of bladder infections increases because the smooth muscles in the urinary tract relax. your breathing will become deeper and you may perspire more than usual from a more active thyroid gland. tip of the week : to alleviate backaches maintain good posture. sit with a footstool or use an ergonomic chair at the office avoid standing for too long sleep with a small pillow under your side at the waist and lift things with your legs instead of your back.

Question: what is tsh?
Answer: tsh is a common skin disorder and is caused by a genetic defect in the hair follicle. it is most common in children and adults. it can occur in any age.
Expected Response: tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment.

Question: can a laser be used for a brazilian hair removal? how do i inquire if this can be done; it's rather embarrassing to ask.
Answer: hi just google brazil and brazil. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: laser hair removal can be done on any part of the body where there is hair. so what we tell our patients as dermatologists is that any pattern that you shave to is what we can follow with that laser. dermatologists are very comfortable with any part of the skin so this is a conversation that you should have very easily with your doctor. just tell them what you are looking for and the pattern that you would like. and they can follow that for you. it could be a little bit more painful so we often recommend using a topical anesthetic for 30-45 minutes before the treatment.

Question: can lack of oxygen cause hives? . my husband has been dealing with hives daily for about 8 myths. he recently had a mi with 100% blockage of his right coronary artery & stent placed. i noticed while he was on supplemental o2 he did not experience hives at all. i also noticed he had a very small amount of blood in his urine. the doctor said this was a viral infection and that the hives were due to his lack of blood. i am not sure what to do.

Question: pinkeye. concerning the discharge. i have only the occasional 'crust' from sleeping but do have what appear to be 'strings' of a mucus like substance that forms in my lower eyelid. i frequently just touch it and pull it out. its white in color and seems to not want to go away. i had thought maybe it was from an allergen but i dont have allergies to speak of nor is this a seasonal thing. is this something i should be concerned about?
Answer: hi i think its from a yeast infection it could be from you its not like you would think its a yeast it just needs time to get rid of it. good luck
Expected Response: it is normal to have some morning accumulation of fluid or mucous-like substance in the corners of the eye. thinner drainage like tears will drain down the nasolacrimal duct into your nose and not be noticed. the thicker material just can make it through this tiny drainage tube. the eye is always secreting tears and lubrication (from oil-like glands under the eyelid) so this is not really alarming. true pink eye (conjunctivitis) is typically painful and the drainage is copious all day long. allergic conjunctivitis tends to itch and last a long long time. making a self-diagnosis can be difficult so if you are concerned then you can address this problem with your medical provider or even optometrist.

Question: what are side effects of drugs used to treat genital herpes?
Answer: many people who have genital herpes are taking a combination of medications that can be harmful to the genital area. these include oral antibiotics (such as penicillin) and antifungal medications (such azithromycin). some of these medications may cause side effects such as: fever vomiting nausea muscle aches and pain.
Expected Response: there are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (zovirax) famciclovir (famvir) and valacyclovir (valtrex). these are all taken in pill form. severe cases may be treated with intravenous (iv) acyclovir. side effects with these drugs are considered mild and health experts believe these drugs are safe in the long term. acyclovir is the oldest of the three and its safety has been documented in people taking suppressive therapy for several years. people taking suppressive therapy should see their doctor at least once a year to decide if they should continue.

Question: i am 54 (female) and have not excercised in years. is it too late to start and also see results? . is there such a thing as toning flabby areas at my age?
Answer: hi you will need to see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking.

Question: can swaddling a baby help during a nap?

Question: tested first time bs fast 135 pp 180 and s. chol 255. is choles due to diabetes or otherwise or both are independant? . i am taking the 2nd dose of bs for my blood pressure and it is still not 100%.
Answer: hi if you google diabetes and bs you will find lots of info on bs it could be just a coincidence. but if you have diabetes and you are taking bs then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: actually the answer is a bit complicated. high cholesterol and diabetes are independent risk factors for heart disease. some people may have one or the other. but many people have both and they do appear to be related. scientists are studying the effects that high blood sugars and insulin resistance have on the different types of fats in the blood. insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. it helps the cells in the body take up and use glucose for energy. in diabetes the cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. glucose then builds up in the blood. the more resistant the cells are to insulin the higher the triglycerides and ldl (or bad cholesterol) levels become. at the same time the hdl (or good cholesterol) levels fall. but the good news is that both diabetes and high cholesterol can respond to the same healthy lifestyle changes. talk to your doctor about positive changes that you can make in your diet and exercise habits that can put you back on the road to good health. webmd is a great source of information about diabetes and about high cholesterol. here are two links to get you started. <link> <link> you may also want to talk to a diabetes educator or nutritionist. they can help create a diet plan that is right for you.

Question: got dtap vaccine week ago. injection area is swollen and has knot gets sorer every day. is this normal? . i am a little over a week pregnant. i took the dtap shot on the 27th of june and the day before that i had a sore throat and a sore chest. i am not sure if this is normal or if it's just a side effect of the shot.
Answer: hi if you have a sore stomach then yes this is a side-effect of the dt shot. but if you are pregnant then yes you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: soreness at the injection site is probably the most common adverse effect especially with the dtap. often this is not just due to vaccine but the trauma of the needle and some bleeding into the tissue (usually this is the cause of the "knot"). warm compresses may help as well as some ibuprofen for the inflammation. if it becomes red and more swollen you will need to see your medical provider to see if you have a injection site infection.

Question: is it healthy to not gain weight during pregnancy? . before i became pregnant i was 245 lbs. now at 20 weeks i'm still the same weight. i'm only supposed to gain 20 lbs according to my doctor. i've been told that i can gain weight with a few days of exercise. i have been told i can't gain weight in my first trimester. is it healthy for me to not lose weight during my pregnancy?
Answer: it is ok to gain weight when you are pregnant. i am not sure if you are referring to weight gain during pregnancy or not. weight gain is a sign of pregnancy. it is normal to gain a lot of weight during a pregnancy. however if you do not gain any weight during your pregnancy it is not a good idea to try and gain weight. weight is a measurement of how much weight you have gained. if you gain weight it is a good sign that you are gaining weight. if your weight is not increasing during pregnancy then you may

Answer: you can prepare your child for a summer vacation at home by using a variety of products that contain peanut butter and/or jelly. you can also use a variety or whole-grain cereal such as rice cereal or wheat germ cereal.
Expected Response: summers are frequently a busy time with many children off [on] school and summer trips. for parents with food allergic children it is easy to forget the epi pen when packing for trips. also when food allergic kids are out of their routine it is also easier to accidently ingest a food they typically avoid. many parents find it helpful to put together an extra small bag/pouch with benadryl epi pens and important phone numbers to carry on vacation.

Question: i have a bump underneath the tip of my tongue. what is it? . i have a sort of bubble like thing underneath the tip of my tongue. it is red and sticks out a good half inch. it is very tender and hurts when it is squeezed. if you look closely at it you can see a blood vessel. what is this?
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very scary. it's not something you can diagnose blindly over the internet. it could be a yeast infection. it would not be possible to blindly guess at this since i don't know anything about you or your medical history. you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. it may take some time for this to resolve. you can always try to get a referral to a primary care provider. it might be a good idea to have this evaluated by a gastroenterologist or a podiatrist. it can be very helpful in getting a diagnosis
Expected Response: i really don't now since i have no way of seeing this lesion and examining you. a vague description really isn't sufficient to make this important diagnostic call so i suggest that you see your medical provider or even dentist to have this "bubble" properly identified.

Question: i can feel my brain moving around and i haven't done anything such as jumping around or shaking my head. is this normal?
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'd suggest you see a neurologist. it's not uncommon for a person to feel a sudden shift in their brain activity. this is especially true if you have a family history of epilepsy. it may be due to a change in the way your brain is functioning. it could be caused by a change to the way you feel or a change of your environment. it also could be a sign of an underlying condition such as a heart condition. it would be best to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: normal? no but i am not able to offer you an explanation as to why you feel your brain is moving around. the brain does not move inside the skull incidentally so what you are experiencing is just a sensation of movement. see your medical provider if this feeling does not go away.

Answer: if you are covered under your employer's plan you can shop for a plan through healthcare. gov or call 1-800-healthinsurance. goverd.
Expected Response: your question touches upon a very important issue and one that many americans struggle with. millions of people either hang onto a job because they can't afford to lose the health insurance or go uninsured which is particularly dangerous for folks like yourself with a chronic condition. job gaps after january 1 2014 will no longer be a concern with regard to health insurance. you'll be able to buy a policy through your state's marketplace and be guaranteed coverage even with a pre-existing health condition. when you lose access to affordable coverage provided by your employer you'll be eligible to buy a plan on your own. likely you'll also qualify for financial assistance to lower your costs.

Expected Response: over the counter pregnancy tests are generally very reliable so it unlikely that you are pregnant. however i would recommend that you see your doctor just to make sure since you are having symptoms of being pregnant. your doctor may also do some additional blood work including a thyroid test to evaluate other reasons for the symptoms which you are experiencing.

Question: can i switch from vicodin to advil without waiting for the vicodin to clear my system? . i have shingles (yes i had the shot too) have been taking acyclovir and vicodin. the vic didn't kill the pain so i been adding 2 advil. after 5 days my feet started swelling and i was worried about my kidneys. i read that acy shouldn't be taken with advil so i stopped the adivil 2 days ago. swelling didn't decrease i stopped the acy about 28 hrs. ago still no change in the swelling. i've decided to stop the vic 5-500 and stick with 600 mg. advil.
Answer: it is important to know that you are not taking any medication that will cause your shingling. you will need to see your doctor for a proper examination.
Expected Response: any patient-specific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it. the vicodin will not be bio-effective after six hours or so so anytime after that.
================================================================================
Question: my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it?
Answer: you can get it from taking a home anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. if you are allergic to any of these medications you should not take them. if your husband has shingle you can take a home antifungal medication like tylenol or acetylsalicylic acid. if he has shingo he can take ibuprophen (an antihistamine) or zyrtec (an antifunctant). you can also take zyrcort (an oral antihistamines). if he is allergic to acetaminopropyl or tylenoxaparin you can try taking a nasal spray like azithromycin (an antibiotic) or tyloxacin (an antiviral medication). if you have had shingling you should talk to your doctor about the possible side effects.
Expected Response: my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus.

Answer: hi as you have a ringworm you would need to see your doctor asap good luck
Expected Response: assuming your husband was properly diagnosed (many skin lesions will mimic ringworm/tinea corporis) an antifungal medication (there are several over the counter medications that the pharmacist could suggest) would likely help. if you are talking about a vaginal yeast medication being used i would suggest that you use one more geared for skin fungus. he will not grow boobs.

Question: i have had a strange itch on my clitoris for a few weeks now. what may be causing this? . my vagina doesn't itch at all but it is dry and has a sour smell every now and then. the itch comes and goes throughout the day and is more annoying than anything else. i use a feminine wash and a feminine deodorant spray. i have tried to alter things by taking them away one by one and then adding them back to see if they were causing the problem but no luck. strangely enough when i went on vacation to the beach for a week the itch went away but returned once i came back home. it has been a while since it happened but i still have the itch. what could be causing it?
Answer: hi it sounds like your having a problem with your clitoris and its a very sensitive area. you can try a natural vaginal cream or a lotion and see what works best for you. good luck
Expected Response: contact allergy could do it. dryer softener sheets with perfume is high on my list followed by enzymatic detergents and bath soaps. it could even be that feminine spray even if you have used it in the past. products often change ingredients without changing the brand name. a yeast infection is quite common in this area so if the itch is limited to the clitoral area use a topical antifungal perhaps mixed half/half with 1% hydrocortisone cream.

Question: 7 year old daughter just wrecked bike and hit the middle bar cuttingt the right side of her labium. should we get xray? . bleeding is minimal and looks bruised. should i be worried about any internal issues with her and have her seen by a doctor for xrays? .
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's very frustrating. i'm not sure what to think about your daughter's reaction to the injury. you need to see a medical provider for a proper examination and perhaps some blood work. there are many things that can cause bleeding and i suspect she'll need to be examined by a medical professional. she should be fine. the best thing to do is call her pediatrician. he or she can help you find out what's going on. wishing you well!
Expected Response: she probably doesn't need an x-ray but she does need a skilled clinician to perform a careful exam. straddle injuries (and i have seen hundreds of them) can cause some significant injuries but most are either repairable (some cause hiddle tears or lacerations requiring sutures) or heal on their own. a gentle and kind medical professional needs to look at those girl parts and see what injuries have occurred. what you can see could only be part of the damage. this exam can be done painless but prepare her for the unavoidable embarrassment of someone looking at her private parts. if she prefers to see a female provider see if this can be arranged. in the meantime put some cool compresses on those painful parts and get her some medical care. don't worry. serious "internal injuries" would not be very likely.

Answer: hi if you have been on antibiotics for a while then you should be ok. but as for the kidney cancer it is not a good idea to delay it. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you have the right to do what you want but does a delay really make medical sense? are you considering this for financial or other personal reasons? i don't know why you would want to delay. i don't know you or your case to advise you in this matter so i strongly suggest that you take the expert advice of the urologist who is treating you or see a second urologist for an official "second opinion".

Question: can dentists treat the elderly if they have moderate dementia?
Answer: dementia is not a medical term. dementia is a genetic disease.
Expected Response: the ideal time to take care of all necessary dental treatments is soon after the person has been diagnosed with dementia. this way only easier maintenance treatments will be needed as the person ages. however the elderly with moderate levels of dementia can be treated and can receive anesthesia. setting a dental appointment early in the day when the person with dementia is most alert may be best. also the caregiver needs to communicate to the person with dementia that he or she is going to the dentist and state the reason for the visit.

Answer: the most important thing to remember is that eating a diet high in fiber and low in calories will not cause the teeth to break. the best way to prevent tooth decay is to avoid foods that are high in sugar or acidic foods.

Expected Response: viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year. please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since i have no way of examining you. the most important thing is fluid replacement. you must stay well-hydrated. don't eat very much for a few more days. most of these viral infections resolve in about 7-10 days so hang in there. at least you are not vomiting so be greatful. in my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas. your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined. abdinal painad diahrea

Question: is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis?
Answer: circumcised and circumcised penises are quite different in sensitivity. circumcision is more sensitive than uncircumscised penis. circumcised penile sensitivity is not a "difference". circumcision is a very sensitive penis. it is the most sensitive penis in the world.
Expected Response: that’s a controversy. i have many patients including physicians as adults who’ve been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they’re hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it’s almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off. some men will tell you that they don’t feel any more or less after the circumcision. some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that don’t like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it’s social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place. there are risks to the surgery. in good hands those risks are minimal but they can’t be eliminated. so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides. usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact. luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling. you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well. great product. hope this helps.

================================================================================
Question: how should my 15-year-old son (5'11" 220 lbs) be eating particularly before his football games and lacrosse games?
Answer: i would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about the type of foods that your child is eating. if he or she is a fan of football you may want to ask the pediatrician to make sure that he or her has a specific recommendation for what to eat. if your child has a problem with his or her eating habits it's important to talk to his or hers about it. if the pediatricians are concerned about the way he or it is eating then it's best to talk with him or her directly.
Expected Response: overall weight will depend on his position on the field. if he has hoped to be on the o-line then he may be small. if he is a quarterback he may be perfect. overall he needs an adequate balance of protein carbs and fat in his diet. carb-loading i typically reserve more for the endurance athletes but keeping properly fueled up is very important. i think in the end good common sense is key. he is a big kid and obviously very active. he needs to eat a lot to keep up and this should be a well-balanced diet. he should also be very aware of keeping well-hydrated but not just water-loading the day of a game. i am sure there are college demographics for typical size for each position on the field but at 15 the most important factor is enough of all of the vitamins minerals and protein that his body requires to stay healthy and fit

Question: severe itching/numbness over right side of body. any advice? . i am a diabetic and hypertensive. i first noticed the itching about a week ago and the numbness came a few days later. it was localized to the right side of my upper abdomen but has since gotten worse. i now have the numbness down my right leg and feels like a band is getting tighter going from the mid line across the right side of my body around to my spine. just wanting to know my next step.
Answer: hi if you have any questions just ask for a call from a doctor or nurse. good luck
Expected Response: the duration progression and distribution of the symptoms makes me think of zoster as a possibility. the painful rash of zoster usually starts after localized symptoms of pain tingling or itching. typically this is seen on one side of the body. a painful rash follows and it resolves within a 2-4 week period if no complications occur. its probably best to see your healthcare provider to get checked and appropriately diagnosed. treatments for zoster can shorten the duration and severity of the illness but treatments needs to be started as soon as the rash appears. nerve damage or neorapthy but sounds like nerve damage for sure have u been n any accidents or anything at home or work it sound like kidney damage.

Expected Response: how old is this infant? what is the infant eating? please repost your question with a bit more information and remember that constipation is not infrequent stools or baby's getting a beet-red face when trying to defecate. constipation is dry hard and infrequent stools. babies/infants do not necessarily poop daily. it can be several times a day or even once a week (a major event! ) and still be considered normal.

Question: do anti-snoring chin straps work? are they safe? if they hold your mouth closed will you wake if you stop breathing?
Answer: yes they are safe. they are a good idea to use them for a few minutes at a time. they will not cause you to cough or sneeze.
Expected Response: you can try it but there are so many underlying factors that cause snoring that it would be best to see your medical provider or an ent first to see if you have a correctable condition. there are chin straps. nose expanders. special pillows. dental appliances. t-shirts with tennis balls sewed in the back. vitamin/mineral/herbal concoctions. that all claim to cure snoring so don't get caught up with false promises. as long as you can have a money-back guarantee (and they actually refund you money) you can try the chin straps. personally. knowing the anatomy quite well. i don't think a strap will be your answer.

Question: i have pcos. why do i gain weight if i'm active and eat well? can i get back to the way i was last year (100 lbs less)? . i used to be a model. very healthly and very active. i went on the birth control pill for a couple of weeks but they made me very sick so i went off of them. that is when this all started. i have always been very active and very healthy. now i'm losing all of my hair; very seldom do i menstrate; i have excessive body hair growth; i gained about 100 pounds; and i have many more symptoms. i have been tossed back and fourth between doctors and noone helps me: they just brush me off on to others.
Answer: hi you have been on the pill for about 3 years now and have been doing well. but now you have lost weight and have gained weight. good luck
Expected Response: pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so it’s important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? what’s a reasonable calorie restriction for you? what’s your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps. <link> i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are "out of whack. " birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle (though not all of the time). i would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologist(sp? ).

Answer: symlin is a common blood vessel infection that can be treated with antibiotics. however if you are concerned about this you should see your primary care medical provider.
Expected Response: you may see one or two drops; this is normal. if you see more than two drops: --you may not have received your full dose. -- do not inject another dose. --talk to your healthcare provider. to prevent dripping or leaking be sure to firmly push and hold the knob with your thumb for 10 seconds before removing needle from skin.

Question: i would just like to know how old you have to be before you can get your tubes tied? i keep getting different answers. i get different answers and i would just like to know from an expert if i can get this done i am almost thirty and i have one child and pregnant with another i want this procedure because my husband will not wear protection and i dont want anymore children.
Answer: i have no way of knowing your age but i can tell you that there is no way to get a "old" tube tied without a medical history. i would suggest that you see a medical provider for a hands-on examination.
Expected Response: you can do it. you just need to address this with your doctor. it is your choice at age thirty and with two (almost) children. this is not a decision that should be made lightly. if your husband is not willing to cooperate (he can get a less-riskier vasectomy! ) then you have to make the decision. you can get an iud or progesterone implant and delay this decision for several years or you can both agree that a tubal ligation is your best choice.

Answer: yes. a urinary tract infection (uti) is a bacterial infection caused by bacteria that live in the urinary tract. a bacterial urinary tract (uti)-infected person will have a higher chance of getting a urinary infection than a non-uti-infected one.
Expected Response: most of the medications used for urinary tract infections are commonly-used antibiotics or medications used to control symptoms. they do not cause cancer.

Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's never easy to tell when you're feeling light headed. it sounds like you're not feeling well. it may be a sign of something else. if you're having a lot or if you feel light headed you may need to see a doctor.
Expected Response: thanks! actually i had some bloodwork done and my vitamin d level was very low (7). i was put on 50 000 iu of a prescription vitamin d for 8 wks (1 a wk). it's been 9 weeks tomorrow and now i'm taking over the counter vitamin d am going back to dr next week to have blood checked again. i felt better after the first 2 wks not dizzy not tired no more headaches. then again i began feeling dizzy lightheaded alot and tired no energy. i don't know what's going on; but i'll hopefully find out. <positive_smiley>

Question: can blood thinners cause cancer. can blood clots and medications for blood clots cause cancer.
Answer: yes. it is possible to have blood clot issues. blood clumping can be caused by a number of conditions including: diabetes. if you have diabetes you may have blood clotting problems. if blood clumps occur you may be at higher risk for developing cancer. you may also have a higher risk of developing cancer from a blood clot. if your blood clot is caused by an infection you may develop a blood clump that is less likely to cause cancer than a blood infection.
Expected Response: there has been no association between the use of blood thinners (there are many different types) and any type of cancer. products that cause cancer would not have been approved by the fda.

Question: can i give my 3 year old daughter childrens claritin and a decongestion med within 24 hours of each other? . the decongestion medicine in a prescription medicine that was given to her for congestion problems in the past. but i'm not sure if her stuffy nose and cough is now from pollen and seasonal allergies.
Answer: i would not give your daughter a decoction medication unless she has a medical problem. i would ask her to see her pediatrician. if she is not allergic to the decoctions i would recommend she consult her pediatric dentist.
Expected Response: decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separately. as long as the dosgages are appropriate. newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the child's medical provider. decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds; and do not help children with allergies. antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the "okay" from your child's pediatrician because of the age.
================================================================================
Question: does an amoxicillin allergy mean i can't take oxacillin? . can i take oxacillin with an amoxicillin allergy even though i took penicillin throughout my childhood without any problems?
Answer: yes. you can take penicillins with an allergy but you can't have an amoxillin allergy.
Expected Response: if you are allergic to amoxicillin you should avoid all drugs in the penicillin class. this would include oxacillin. it is entirely possible to have taken a penicillin in childhood without any adverse reaction and then develop an allergy later in life. that's because allergies develop upon repeated exposure to an allergen. in other words almost no one is allergic to penicillin the first time they're exposed. most people exhibit an allergic reaction on some subsequent exposure. you should be sure to note your penicillin allergy on your medical record. a severe allergic reaction to penicillin can result in death. for most needs there are other antibiotics that can be used in place of a penicillin. wishing you well!
================================================================================
Question: can dads suffer from postpartum depression?
Answer: it's not uncommon for a father to experience postpartums depression. it's also common for a mother to experience depression. if you're concerned about your child's health or depression you need to talk to your doctor. it can be difficult to talk about depression with your doctor because it's hard to tell if your child is suffering from depression or not. talk to a counselor or counselor-in-training if you have depression. talk about what your child needs to do to cope with depression. the best way to help your child cope is to talk with your counselor or psychologist.
Expected Response: postpartum depression has received more attention in recent years. but most of it has focused on moms. a new study published in jama found some interesting results: about 10% of dads suffer from postpartum depression too. yes 1 in 10 dads become seriously depressed between their partners’ first trimester and in the first year (usually the first three to six months) of their child’s life. and men are more likely to be depressed when their partners are depressed. as you might imagine it’s difficult to provide a nurturing environment for a baby when both parents are feeling down. this is a real issue for new parents to be aware of.

Question: can i still get hepatitis b through sexual transmission if i have already been fully vaccinated? . i am a male. i am currently immunized against hepatitis b. i have been vaccinated against the virus for a year. i do not have a history of hepatitis b or any other health problems.
Answer: hi if you have been properly vaccinated and have not had any problems you should be fine. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer if your vaccination was successful then you will be protected against getting hepatitis b through sexual contact. not all vaccinations "take" so the only way to be sure is to have your medical provider order a test to prove that your hepatitis b antibodies are high and protective. remember that hepatitis b is not the only disease that can be contracted sexually. practice safe sex always.

Question: will/can the popular "egg" vibrators damage the uterus? . the "egg" vibrator is inserted in the vagina. it is not attached to the cervix. it does not hurt. it will not damage the cervicle. the "cream" is inserted into the vagina and it will help the uterus. the only thing that is causing this is that the "cervical" is not being used. i am not sure what kind of pill you are using but it is a good idea to use a condom. i will not be able to use the "pill" because i am using a condom on my own. please help!
Answer: hi the only way you can get rid of your uterus is to get rid and get rid. but you can try some good natural ways to get your uterus out of your body. just google natural ways out of the uterus and natural ways of getting rid of the womb. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer probably not but no one has really tested this in a clinical study. hi see above answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on webmd. hi i think your find like most things if you don't over use it your be ok there is not much info relaying to the egg but if this is a battery operated on just try the older ones the rely on just rubbing together this cause's a vibration the stops till you hit another bump. so next time you see a woman with a silly grin you now know why. good luck

Question: what are pregnacy chances after a tubaligation? . i had my tubes tied after i had my son 4 yrs ago. i am 27 yrs old and i believe i'm showing signs of early pregnancy. i was told that i was pregnant but i'm not sure if that's true or not. i'm also having a tubel procedure and i'm worried about the possibility of having a miscarriage.
Answer: hi if you have had your tubes tied you could have a miscarriage but the chances of you being pregnant are very low. if you had a tub and you are having a period then you may have a period. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely for you to be pregnant after having a tubal ligation. surgeons are very careful to make sure those fallopian tubes are cut cauterized and separated. there have been a few cases where the tubal was blotched but before thinking you are pregnant see you medical provider for a very accurate pregnancy test and careful examination. there are many things that can mimic a falser pregnancy so get it checked out. i know that it's highly unlikey but my aunt got her tubes tied after she had my cousin and 2 years later she got pregnant with her last one. so it is possible but it can happen

Question: i have had a left knee replacement using the zimmer flex lps and i have had nothing but pain in the knee and outside . the ortho said there is nothing wrong when he looked at my xray and said i should go for a second opinion. this replacement was done 6mo ago dec 6th. when going to the site for the brand of knee it has numerous issues posted by other patients. any other input would be appreciated. thank you.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it's not uncommon for orthopedic surgeons to have issues with knee pain. the knee is a delicate organ that needs to be protected from injury. it can be difficult to diagnose the cause of a knee injury without a physical examination. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to have this evaluated. it sounds like you're dealing with a very serious problem. you need to see your primary medical provider right away. he or she can order a second evaluation to
Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it must be frustrating to go through a major surgery and then continue to experience pain issues. if your orthopedic surgeon suggested you get a second opinion i'd advise you to do just that. it's possible a different surgeon with different experience in joint replacement will be able to identify the source of your pain and treat it. a number of conditions could cause the pain you describe. if you have a fever (101f) nausea or feeling like you might be coming down with the flu i'd suggest you call your orthopedist as soon as possible as these may be signs of an infection. otherwise i'd suggest you get that second opinion. i hope you find relief soon!

Question: asthma. i was to be treated for asthma when i was younger for maybe a year. now i am 21 and have recently been having trouble breathing when walking across campus or up stairs. i am not overweight. i have been smoking cigarettes occasionally though. could this be bringing back the symptoms of asthma?
Answer: hi if you have asthma then you have a good chance of getting it back as it can be very difficult to get it back. if you are not overweight then you can get it again. hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect asthma. if you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this; 1. put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes (i. e. stepping out of a warm car into cold air. ) 2. start deep breathing exercises. my doctor had me start with just ten a day. he said to find a quiet relaxing place where i can time my breaths. breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you can't. do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath. each night try holding it a little longer. you will be amazed how well this will help 3. check with a doctor. your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath. you may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes. 4. ask ten smokers over 40 when they started and why. also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same. both my kids tried smoking in college. after doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive. good luck! and use your head!

Answer: hi as you have read from the link below its from the uk's nhs your find out how often you have vaginal yeast infections. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: neither. a bacteria is a bacteria. a virus is a virus. vaginal yeast is a yeast (fungus). the duration of treatment as well as the success of your treatment depends on what you are using and how well your body responds to that particular treatment. assuming you were accurately diagnosed and properly treated most women are better in less than a week.

Question: how long should a parent brush or help brush a child's teeth?
Answer: brushing teeth is a good idea. the best way to brush teeth is to use a toothbrush with a tooth brush. this will allow the tooth to grow and be easier to brush. brushing is a great way to help your child grow and learn.
Expected Response: it takes many years before children develop the fine motor coordination they need to do a good tooth brushing job. some dentists advise that parents brush their children's teeth until the child can neatly write his or her own name. other dentists suggest parents use their own judgment but to consider between ages 6 and 8 as the time for kids to take on the job of keeping their teeth clean and healthy. general rule: a smear or pea sized drop of fluoridated toothpaste can be used when the child can spit effectively.

Question: do hernias usually develop on both sides of the body?
Answer: the most common type of hernia is hernia. it is the most commonly found in the upper abdomen. it can be caused by a variety of conditions including: a common hernia that is located in the abdomen (usually on the right side of the abdomen) and is often mistaken for a hernia in some cases. the hernia is usually located in a part of the lower abdomen called the abdominal wall. it may also be located in other parts of the upper body such as the abdomen. hernies are usually caused by infection from a fungus or bacteria.
Expected Response: groin hernias are somewhat more likely to develop on both sides. this is probably because the structural elements develop symmetrically and the stresses on the body that occur over time are similar on both sides. when a patient becomes aware of a groin swelling on one side examination by a doctor will often identify a small hernia on the opposite side.

Question: how do i keep from waking up hungry? . i usually eat dinner between 6 and 8 at night but i'm always ravenously hungry when i wake up (between 5-6 on weekdays and 7-8 on weekends). sometimes i even wake up and struggle to get back to sleep due to hunger. i eat protein with every meal and eat several small meals a day the largest always being dinner in hopes of not waking up hungry. it's not a thyroid problem i've had that tested twice in the past 2 years and i'm 30 pounds overweight (failing to lose weight for 3 years now). i'm also overweight and have a lot of other health issues. i'm not sure if i should be worried or not.
Answer: i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds like you're hungry. i'd suggest you get to a doctor or healthcare provider for a physical exam. you can also get a blood test to see if you have a thyroid condition. it could
Expected Response: in some cases waking up hungry would not be a problem but it sounds like it is affecting your quality of life. in addition to your protein source at dinner try including a big salad and/or soup whole grains and some healthy fat (olive oil avocado etc. ). eating from all the food groups helps increase feelings of fullness. you can also try a bedtime snack of something light like fruit with peanut butter or whole grain crackers and cheese. if you are staying up late this can increase hunger so getting to sleep early can help. you also want to make sure you get enough to eat earlier in the day including a good breakfast and lunch with in between healthy snacks. also make sure you are hydrated so that isn't being confused with hunger. for more tips on managing your hunger see this article. good luck!

Question: what should i eat during a flare-up of ulcerative colitis symptoms?
Answer: i would suggest you see your doctor for a complete medical history and some other diagnostic tests.
Expected Response: during a flare-up the large intestines become inflamed causing diarrhea and discomfort. many experts recommend going on a non-residue diet -- one that eliminates foods that are difficult to digest or that contain indigestible fiber. that means avoiding fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds and whole grains. some doctors recommend a liquid diet during severe flare-ups. with no food passing through the large intestines the bowels have time to heal. a low-residue diet is also recommended for people who have developed a narrowing of the lower small intestine called the ileum. keep in mind that no two people respond the same way. "some patients do well on a low-fiber low-residue diet but every patient is different " says david t. rubin md co-director of the inflammatory bowel disease center at the university of chicago.

Question: can antidepressants cause weight gain?
Answer: no. the main reason for weight gain is due to the fact that the body can't use the right amount of fat to fuel the body. this means that it takes longer for the body to use the correct amount of calories.
Expected Response: most of the antidepressants and probably all of the mood stabilizer[s] can and do cause weight gain. bupropion -- commonly known as aplenzin wellbutrin or zyban -- usually does suppress appetite and can result in less weight gain than other antidepressants. within each family or class of meds there are some that are more weight-gain prone and others that are a bit more friendly. ask your doctor specifically about the more weight-friendly ones. also be careful in that weight gain may lead to diabetes and cholesterol problems. if you have gained ask your doctor to check on these and blood pressure too.

Expected Response: abnormalities in blood pressure often relate to the diet and the body's ability (or inability) to absorb nutrients from food. to deal with that problem i suggest you read about the gaps diet and dr natasha mcbride. there's a powerful interview with dr mercola here: <link> as for your erectile dysfunction problem it is common to lose your erection at times - especially under stress. the fastest way to lose an erection is to start worrying about your penis and how long you are going to last. allow yourself to enjoy the feelings in your penis as you squeeze it at the base. this is the natural way to attain an erection. then focus on how arousing your woman is and how much she turns you on. if you are not attracted to your woman a different focusing strategy is required.

Question: how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish you all the best! i'm not sure what you mean by "stress test" but i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- to get a better idea of what's going on. if you're concerned about your cholesterol you may want to talk to your health care provider about whether or not you should stop taking
Expected Response: after an operation cardiologist and my doctor decided to put me under statines and cardioaspirine and i followed their prescriptions for one year since i noticed that i have muscular problems and strange troubles when i streched them. one time i had to stay in bed for 3 days without force like if it was a serious atack of flue. after i read that this was a side effect of statines i decided to stop and to change my life. one year after and 10kg less i just pass an exam and the cardiologist says to me that everything is perfect cholesterol is under the limit cardiogram and an effort test have been without any problem. the doctor says to me to continue absolutely with statines and cardioaspirine as i didn't say to him that i stop to take them since one year for me is a good sign. the results are obtained like this: with exercice and with a strict dieta. every morning from 7 to 9 i do exercices in a fitness center. one part with a group one part alone with all the machines. in one year i frequently arrive to make exercices that many young people can't and i'm like an exemple for that center as i am 70 years old. i only take a rest one time a week. about dieta i avoid all industrial food like cakes or pastries but also bread rice potatoes pastas and pizzas (especially in the evening) i only eat meat one time a week (frequently chicken with a glass of wine) the other days only fish and 4 o 5 different vegetables cooked in the oven. two to 4 meals a week with nuts and seeds of any kind. (15 different sorts in a very small quantity as together it can be 150 grams). i was never feeling so well and i'm still actifve in my company. frankly statines are the contrary of what we need as they provoke muscular problems and other different sicknesses and this can impeach you to make the exercice that you need. it's really a non-sense medication! you are becoming impotent and more sick instead of beeing better. when i heard that actually there is a campaign among doctors and medias to prescribe statines even for chieldren it's really like a crime. the level of cholesterol has been invented by doctors payed by the producers of statines and not by indipendent doctors. remember.

Question: can b 12 cause leg cramps? . since my husband started taking b 12 he has been getting severe leg cramps. he has also been having cramps on his left side. he also has a rash on his right side.
Answer: hi if this is your problem then you should go see your doctor or get him to a doctor. good luck
Expected Response: i don't know why your husband it getting leg cramps. there can be dozens of reasons but i can tell you that vitamin b12 doesn't cause them. he will need to discuss this issue with his medical provider to determine a cause. and a solution. remember that men can be stubborn about getting medical care so your encouragement is very important. i can't speak to the science or the research but i did not have leg cramp problems until i started taking b-12. i stopped taking it and have not had any leg cramp problems since. your husband is not alone in having a similar experience.

Question: i'm 34 have hot flashes night sweats high fsh levels and no period for two months. do i have ovarian failure? . after a progesterone withdrawal test my period started in two days. i have been on a low dose of progesterones for about two months now. i'm very worried about ovarian failure and high fp levels. i've been on the low dose for about a month now.
Answer: hi i think you should see your doctor for a test. good luck
Expected Response: what the progesterone withdrawal tells you is that there is definitely some stimulation of the lining of the uterus by estrogen -- estrogen can come from the ovary and it also can be made in other parts of the body too. if the fsh is high it does mean that most likely you are heading toward menopause. the major question i would ask you is "are you hoping to have children beyond this point? " if you are i would encourage you to consult with a gynecologist who specializes in what is called reproductive endocrinology as soon as you can. (the american society of reproductive medicine or asrm could help you find someone near you if you don't know of anyone locally). if you are not planning for children at this point there is no race toward intervention. if you are indeed heading toward menopause and are having symptoms you would be a good candidate for a low-dose birth control pill that would take care of your symptoms well. as i have mentioned before for women who do experience premature ovarian failure taking hormones is usually a good idea -- so do not be afraid of hormonal intervention.

Question: what is the difference between lovaza and the otc fish oil products?
Answer: the difference is that lovaza is more expensive and less effective at treating fish oil than fish oil. so if you are a registered dietitian and you are taking lovaza for fish oil you may want to look into the benefits of fish oil supplements.
Expected Response: and one that i have to answer a lot because many people don't know that they really need to get the prescription filled! the fda-approved dose of lovaza is four capsules per day. it could take up to 14 capsules per day of an omega-3 supplement to provide the same amount of active ingredients proven to lower very high triglycerides. omega-3 dietary supplements have not been approved by the fda to treat any specific disease like very high triglycerides. supplements also do not go through an fda approved manufacturing process. if you have any other questions talk to your pharmacist it’s worth the extra time.

Question: does crixivan cure human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids)?
Answer: yes. crixivir is a viral infection that is caused by the crixiva virus. the virus is spread by direct contact with the skin.
Expected Response: crixivan is not a cure for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). people taking crixivan may still develop infections or other conditions associated with hiv. because of this it is very important for you to remain under the care of a doctor. although crixivan is not a cure for hiv or aids crixivan can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses associated with hiv. crixivan may not have these effects in all patients.

Question: does your spouses doctor have to inform you that your spouse has an std other than hiv? . my spouse and i share the same primary care md he knows about my husbands affairs and he's prescribed antibiotics to him more than once. i don't know if this is a good idea or not.
Answer: you are correct. it is not recommended that you share any of your medical information with your spouse. the doctor will need to advise you about the best course of action to take to protect yourself and your spouse from transmitting an std to others. you may want to consult your doctor about this issue.
Expected Response: because of strict hippa privacy rules a medical provider is prohibited by law from revealing any medical information to another person including a wife. just because your husband was prescribed antibiotics in no way implies that he is being treated for an std.

Question: how often should i replace my mascara?
Answer: most helpful answer you can use a mascara that contains a moisturizing ingredient like retinol. this will help prevent breakouts and wrinkles.
Expected Response: masacara should be kept no longer than three months after opening. after three months bacteria can begin to grow inside the tube; this growth of bacteria can lead to an infection. a strange or foul odor from your tube of mascara is another sign that your tube has expired. if you notice that your mascara appears flakey or is caking up discard of it. you should also replace your mascara if you contract any type of eye infection; such as conjunctivitis (pink eye). this will prevent you from becoming reinfected. it is also not a good to share your mascara with others. if you suspect that you are having a bad reaction after you have applied your mascara please remove the mascara discard of the tube and consult your physician.

Question: what's the difference between the nasal spray and injectable vaccines for flu?
Answer: nasal spray is used to treat influenza. injectable vaccine is used for people who have a weakened immune system.
Expected Response: the traditional flu shot contains proteins separated from the flu virus. those proteins can't cause illness. but your immune system learns to recognize them and mounts a protective reaction if a real live flu virus tries to infect you. the flumist nasal spray works differently. it contains a live flu virus that has been weakened to the point that it can't cause the flu. that sounds pretty scary but millions of people have safely taken this kind of vaccine. the advantage of the nasal spray is that in children who have never had the flu or a flu vaccine before it seems to elicit a stronger immune response than the flu shot.

Question: what are hormonal causes for heavy periods?
Answer: hormonal causes include: hormonal changes in the body such as changes in your menstrual cycle hormones that are produced during pregnancy or during pregnancy. hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may be caused by: changes in how your ovaries are formed or changes in hormones that can affect your menstrual cycles. hormonal fluctuations that occur in the way your body adjusts to changes in hormonal levels during pregnancy such as increased blood pressure or increased blood sugar. hormonal variations in your blood vessels that are involved in your circulation such as a narrowing of the blood vessels during pregnancy and changes in a variety of blood vessels in the uterus. hormonal factors that increase the risk of pregnancy include: changes to your blood sugar levels. changes in blood pressure. changes to how your blood pressure changes during pregnancy increase the chance of getting pregnant. changes that affect your blood cholesterol. changes such as hormonal changes to the way you feel your blood clots or changes to a blood clot that may be causing your blood to
Expected Response: in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand. this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime (eshre 2007). even the use of most hormonal contraceptives (pill/patch/ring) will yield a monthly bleed. so it’s no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual. to address the most-pressing question “when should i be concerned? what is the medical definition of too much bleeding? ” there is a medical definition of “too-heavy periods. ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc (2. 7 ounces — about 1/3 of a cup) or more that is excessive bleeding. trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom! some general indications of excessive bleeding can include: * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60-90 minutes for several hours. * passage of large clots (quarter-sized or larger). * significant bleeding for more than seven days. probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities. so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations. hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation-associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don’t decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened. prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows. there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth (“adenoma”) or a problem with the hypothalamus. all of the stress-related causes of not ovulating (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc. ) can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus. increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time. there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed. so if you or someone you know have episodes of heavy blood loss rather than a normal period talk to your doctor because there are ways to stop going with the flow.

Question: how do you break a fever in a toddler?
Answer: yes. a fever is a fever.
Expected Response: it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature 98. 6f. it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at 98. 6f. what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of 101 f. but the body is still 98. 6 f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever "breaks"? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to 98. 6f. now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98. 6f. it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever "breaking". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff.

Question: i am 54 (female) and have not excercised in years. is it too late to start and also see results? . is there such a thing as toning flabby areas at my age?
Answer: hi i think it would be best if you get your self a test done there. but do get a test in your local pubic hair salon. good luck
Expected Response: most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking. according to the experts it is never too late to start an exercise program. they have worked with people in nursing homes who were unable to walk and got them walking again! get cleared by your doctor first to make sure you do not have any underlying health problems. start gradually. just walking at first and then you can join a gym and work with a trainer for a while. you will be surprise with the results. it is never too late to start exercising. it is important that you get a professional trainer to guide you in exercising. you can start with something like yoga which will not be too stressful along with brisk walking. once your body adjusts to this routine you can hit the gym for light weights too.

Question: what is the difference between gralise gabapentin and nuerotin gabapentin?
Answer: the two medications are not the same. the two drugs are related in a very similar way. the gralize gabpacentin is a generic version of nuerotil gabpentin and the nuerotic gabpanentin is an oral version of gralis gabentin. both of these medications are available in different forms.
Expected Response: gabapentin is the generic name for a prescription drug used to treat seizures nerve pain and other problems. gabapentin is produced by different manufacturers under various brand names including neurontin gralise fanatrex gabarone neogab and nupentin. all of these medications contain the same active ingredients. the formulation of the non-active ingredients (binders colorings) may be different. however the medications should work exactly the same when you take them. you should not notice any difference between taking gralise and neurontin for example. if you had been taking gralise and suddenly received neurontin when you refilled your prescription you can talk to your pharmacist to find out why. however it shouldn't matter which specific brand name you take. they should work the same for you. hope this helps!

Question: how is copper superior to other antimicrobial surfaces? how is copper superior to other antimicrobial surfaces? . i recently came across a scientific blog which was titled “copper kills 99. 9% of bacteria within two hours! ” well i initially thought it was just a media hype; however with further research it came out to be quite true. i am not a big fan of copper because it is a very strong antimicrobial surface. i think it is better to use it as a barrier to prevent the spread of germs. i have also found that copper is better absorbed than other antimicrobials because it has a stronger antibiotic properties. i don't know if that is true or not but i am hoping it will change.
Answer: the only way to prevent germs is to use copper-based antibacterial products.

Question: how would an emergency aid physician handle a 100 degree fever in a three year-old. so i'm a novelist trying to figure out a hospital scene in my latest work. my character has just taken her son to the hospital because they both have fevers of over 100 (she is at 100 her three year-old is at 103) and she is basically in a panic. . they both have mono (the mother had it first and transferred it to her son unknowingly) and i've done research to find how a doctor would treat this. what i need to know is how the physician would break the fever. . thank you very much.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. fever is not something that can be treated with a hospital-based emergency department. fever can be caused by many things. some of the most common are: an infection such as pneumonia (flu) an infection caused by a virus (such as strep) or an infection that is
Expected Response: a few problems with your story. 1. fever is harmless; both the 103 and the 100. it is unlikely that an experienced physician would do anything. fever is more beneficial and does not need to be treated at all. 2. mono is a virus and it is not treatable either

Question: how will i know if my boss gets rid of company insurance because of the affordable care act?
Answer: if your employer has a plan that covers a particular health condition or condition that you are eligible for you will be able to get a subsidy to cover that condition or health condition. if your company has a policy that covers certain conditions you will not be required to purchase a plan.
Expected Response: the only real way to know is to ask. however if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law i would be wary of the answer. in fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so. they'll also pay a penalty if at least one full-time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces. today 98% of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94% of businesses with 50 to 199 employees. and they’ve providing insurance long before the aca became law for a host of good reasons the law doesn't change. for one providing insurance is a tax-free form of compensation. and a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees. we have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50-employee threshold – it could certainly raise an employer's costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and don’t offer insurance. and some industries with part-time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week. but for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs. i would need to know more about your particular employer's situation but on the face of it it doesn't seem eliminating insurance if it's already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law. i have been in the health insurance business for 40 years. the aca (obamacare) mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans. this is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance. one wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own. the exchanges are simply private insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace. they are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price. no one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges. some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others. these private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks. it is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business. that having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system. it simply has not worked and i personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future. in fact in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with canadian citizens. i know i know canadians are marching to the us for their health care needs. this post is to short to actually address this issue but suffice to say canadians are not coming in any great numbers to the us for their basic health care needs. actually when you factor out tourists from canada who receive emergency treatment the incidence of canadians coming to the us is actually quite small and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in canada for those types of services. take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies. many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend. for your research pleasure i would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future. see the book "the healing of america; a global quest for better cheaper and fairer health care" by t. r. reid. finally yes we have the finest health care system in the world but only if you can afford it. the answer this so called " expert " gave is misleading. the truth is that the aca will cost small businesses more or it will cost tax payers way more. anytime the government says they give subsidies they are talking about using the taxes they collect from you and your boss to pay for it. so it is a pay me now or pay me later thing. this law is not suppose to work. it is designed to crush privately owned insurance and collapse the healthcare system in our country. they want a single payer system. the same one that has failed in every country and in every way. so yes it will cost you more. a lot more and for less coverage. anytime an obama spokesperson talks about how obamacare isn't working they end it with" that's why we need a single payer system". so take what this site says with a grain of salt. they are part of healthcare. gov. this administration in the white house has lied from day one. my daughters employer switched retirees to another plan. even her disability annuity is less. she has just undergone colon surgery and the new plan does not offer her required med supplies nursing home for rehab even her disability annuity is less. read where a lot of corporations have done this - tired of everything being blamed on obama. what are people doing especially thru the surgeries infections wound pumps - when something like this happens i will put it this way. my wife has a heart condition and went without seeing a dr for almost 4 years because we could not afford the insurance. now she has seen her dr and dentist and has not paid a penny more than the premium. we are one of the few 1st world countries without a centralized health care system. the reason for that is because the insurance companies are going to loose a lot of money. aca will work and that scares the pants off the insurance companies.

Question: i was born with one testicle when i did a spermogram i find out that i suffer from hypospermia. is there any cure?
Answer: hi i think you need to see your doctor asap good luck
Expected Response: obviously there is no cure for a missing testicle. the low sperm count can not be increased but a fertility specialist can collect and spin down several ejaculates if you are planning a pregnancy. your accumulated sperm can then be inserted in your female partner as an artificial insemination.

Question: i have been taking advil for over 3 weeks i want to stop and switch over to plain aspirin. can i do that safely? . i heard that you cannot just stop taking advil. i have been taking 2 twice a day for back pain. i also have been feeling dizzy and have been nauseous. i want this to stop.
Answer: you can try plain aspirin but it may not be as effective as plain ibuprofen. you should consult your healthcare provider for a consultation.
Expected Response: yes. you can just stop taking advil (ibuprofen). there will be no health consequences. why would you want to swtich to plain aspirin? aspirin can have more side-effects than ibuprofen depending on your dose and how you use it so it would be wise to run this by your medical provider -- someon who knos your medical history.

Question: skin rashes no iching or discomfort at all? . a week i noticed i two sets of small red patches on my skin. they are all smaller than the size of a dime. the first set is on my inner forearm which consists of about 10 small circular red patches that run from my wrist to my elbow area. the second set of 4-5 rashes is on my hips right below my right waistline. these bumps are a bit more flaky but fit the same description as above. these rashes do not invoke discomfort at all but they will not go away. i live in a college dorm.
Answer: hi if you have a cold and you are not taking any medicines or supplements then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: hi i would check out your bed try using some apple cider vinegar on them see what happens. good luck

Question: why do my hands shake involuntarily? it happens when i'm trying to do something precise like pour sugar in my cup. it also happens after i've eaten something so my blood sugar isn't low. and i do drink but i've ruled out delirium tremors. i had eaten something tonight and then when i went to bring my chicken wings to the table i dropped them on the floor. when i had to drive because my gf was too tired my anxiety was through the roof. i feel like my anxiety goes hand in hand with my shaky hands. but i don't know the cause.
Answer: i don’t know anything about you or your medical history but you may have a few conditions. you may also have a history of heart disease. if you have any of these conditions you need to see a cardiologist.
Expected Response: this may be an advanced warning sign of parkinson's! if it continues through the next day or so you need to see a doctor. now that i've got you worked up it really might not be that bad. are you getting enough sleep? drinking a lot of coffee? these are the most common causes of shaky hands. lack of sleep may also contribute to anxiety. if this is not the case you may want to evaluate any prescription or recreational drugs that you use. i remember trying an maoi once and my hands got shaky i was sweating like mad and got really anxious. i was even on the lowest prescription dose! many chemicals interact with our nervous system and it all comes down to genetics. you may need to stop drinking entirely to get a full and correct evaluation.

Question: does tt injection needs to be taken once every 6 months or after sustaining cuts with a sharp object? . i sustained a cut on one of my fingers and blood started oozing out immediately. i washed the wound under running tap water and then applied pressure on it using kitchen tissue. after some time the blood stopped and the cut was hardly visible unless you took a closer look. i then cleaned the wound using aftershave lotion and then covered the wound surface with neosporin gel and bandaged it. it happened 2 days from now. do i need to take a tt injection? the last time i took it in mar 2013.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'd suggest you see a medical provider for a proper examination. the only way to get a definitive answer is to see a specialist. if you're concerned about your wound or blood quality you should see a board-certified wound care provider. you can also get a blood
Expected Response: tetanus vaccines are 100% protective against tetanus for ten years. the injection does not protect you against any other wound infection -- just tetanus --- so good first aid after any injury is always necessary. there are much better antiseptics than after shave lotion (alcohol) so perhaps you should improve your home first-aid kit. you can always get wound infections.

Question: what foods should a person avoid if he or she has heartburn gerd or barrett's esophagus?
Answer: it is important to discuss the specific foods you are consuming with your doctor. it is best to discuss these foods with your health care provider before you begin any new dietary restrictions.
Expected Response: eating certain foods including onions peppermint and high-fat foods as well as drinking alcohol can cause the lower esophageal sphincter muscle which controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach to relax. when this muscle fails to close the acid-containing contents of the stomach can travel back up into the esophagus producing heartburn. caffeinated beverages and foods (such as coffee tea colas and chocolate) can also aggravate heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). tomatoes citrus fruits or juices also contribute additional acid that can irritate the esophagus. in addition smoking relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter contributing to heartburn and gerd.

Question: how is ringworm of the scalp or beard treated?
Answer: ringworm is a skin disease caused by a fungus called ringworm. it is most common in the scalp and beard. it can be treated with antibiotics or a topical steroid cream.
Expected Response: ringworm of the scalp or beard is treated with antifungal pills in combination with antifungal shampoo or lotion. topical antifungal medicines such as shampoos or lotions that you apply directly to the infected area do not work when used alone because they cannot get deep enough into the infected hair shaft to kill fungi there. but antifungal shampoo helps prevent spreading the fungus to other people because it decreases fungal shedding from the scalp or beard area. doctors also recommend occasional use of antifungal shampoos for ringworm carriers people who can spread the fungus but do not have ringworm symptoms. often an adult becomes a carrier after exposure to an infected child. what to think about ringworm of the scalp or beard can come back after treatment has cleared the infection. ringworm of the scalp or beard can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Answer: hi your find that if you are taking a pill you will get your period but it will take some time for your body to get used to it. so if you have a period then you should be ok. good luck

Answer: hi if you have been having unprotected sex then you are not pregnant then you should be ok. but if you are worried then you can get on bc its safe to do this its free and easy to use. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: if you had your period - you have no reason to worry. plus it's unlikely that you were ovulating at that time (a week before your period is well after when you'd typically ovulate). it's very unlikely that you pregnant.
================================================================================
Question: missed period 3 days after sex? . i've been on the pill for 2 1/2 years and take it correctly. had sex without a condom (he did not pull out) right before my period was due and the period never started. had some very slight light-colored bleeding and some cramps the day it was due (three days after sex) but still no "real" period 3 days later (6 days after sex). pregnant?
Answer: hi ok you could try this you should find out what is going on its a good way to get your period. its just a couple of simple things you can do to get pregnant. first get your blood sugar under control. then take a test. if your doctor tells you your blood sugars are normal then go see your doctor. if you are not sure what your problem is you could get pregnant from any of these things. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: hi 3 days before your period is not the time to get pregnant now having sex around day 12 now then you would have to worry so think back did you have unprotected sex then by the way day 12 would be 12 days from the beginning of your last period. ok but your on the bc pill yes? did you know that the bc pill is only 99% protective so do you think your in the 1%? it could be that your just having a skipped period it happens but if you doubt this get to your doctor a have a pregnancy test done nothing like being spot on. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my 12 yr old brother has not had any vaccinations. how would he go about being immunized now? the immunization schedule. here in alberta begins at 2 months. for whatever reason my parents did not immunize my brother. he frequently gets acute bronchitis (for about a week) and always gets bronchitis when he gets sick. the last time i had taken him in for antibiotics the doctor asked if he had all his vaccinations. i told him that i thought he was up to date with his immunization schedule but later found out he had never been immunized. how would being vaccinated affect my brother frequently having bronchitis?
Answer: hi as for your brother being immunised you would need to see your doctor for a check up. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: in the u. s. the centers for disease control has a "catch-up" vaccination schedule (<link> but i am not sure if canada has a similar resource. i am a huge supporter of vaccines but realistically being vaccinated may not be protective against bronchitis (which is usually viral). influenza and pneumonia vaccines may help him however.

Question: can genital herpes cause chronic insomnia? . i've been so extremely sleepy for the past few years and while i am somewhat stressed i don't think stress can have this much damage in my life. i'm even super sleepy when i don't have school (i. e. summer breaks). i'm pretty sure i have genital herpes based on other symptoms but could this life-crippling insomnia be caused by genital herpes? ! . could treating my genital herpes help my sleep improve (a lot)? . any input would be greatly appreciated!
Answer: hi its not a good idea to take your own advice from your doctor or get your own test done. but if you do get your test done its best to get it done within a week. but do get to the doctor and get a test done there. good luck
Expected Response: actually "insomnia" is not the proper word. my trouble is mostly getting a good quality of sleep rather than falling asleep. i don't have too much trouble falling asleep but i don't drift away too easily either. looking back my super-bad quality of sleep started after i received oral sex from someone who had oral herpes! i feel so stupid because it didn't cross my mind that not having symptoms doesn't mean that i can't contract the virus!
================================================================================
Question: i had unprotectedsex withmy partner he ejaculate near vagina and i washed it all and took plan b will i get pregnant?

Question: who is at risk for psoriatic arthritis?
Answer: psoriasis is a condition that is caused by a virus that causes inflammation of the skin. psoriases are caused by viruses that cause inflammation of other parts of the body. psoriasis is a skin condition that affects the skin and is caused primarily by the virus. the most common causes of psorias are sun exposure and skin cancer. psorsis is also caused by the immune system. psoresis is a common skin disease that affects people who have psoriata. psoreasis is not caused by an infection. psitis is caused when the immune cells that attack the skin react with a virus. psosmos is a type of skin disease caused by bacteria that live in the skin called keratosis. keratitis is a bacterial skin disease. it is caused because the immune cell that attacks the skin reacts with a bacterium called keratin. keratin is a protein that is found in keratin
Expected Response: affecting men and women equally about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis may develop at any age but usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50. while the cause is not known genetic factors along with the immune system likely play a role in determining who will develop the disorder. as many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. having a parent with psoriasis triples the chance of getting psoriasis yourself and thus increases the chance of developing psoriatic arthritis.

Question: why shouldnt i combine a multivitamin and a folic acid pill togather?
Answer: multivitamins are not needed for every person but they can be helpful for a few people. you should talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about the benefits of multivamins.
Expected Response: you can take them together. keep in mind that most multivitamins have 400 mcg of folic acid already. studies showing a benefit to taking folic acid have generally used the amount in a multivitamin.

Question: i want to be ugly. i want some kind of potion that gives me rashes and red spots all over my body for one day. please. i'm not happy looking like a beautiful guy. i want to be ugly and not stand out in the crowd positively. is there something i can take once per day that will give me all kinds of ugliness? . i see people getting rashes from all sorts of places but not on purpose. i don't want to poison myself too much by experimenting so i need help with having a not-too-painful way to do this. please. this is serious.
Answer: hi ok good luck
Expected Response: this is a serious response. medical professionals do not provide potents that make people ugly for a day or at least not since the dark ages so you may need to see a theatrical make-up artist.
================================================================================
Question: i want to take nyquil but can i take it if i am taking buproprion?
Answer: you can take buprovera but you will need to speak to your pharmacist before you start taking it.
Expected Response: never take paxil or prozac and nyquil as these two drugs triple the dose of nyquil in your system and can hurt your heart and you. bupropion only has a mild interaction in a very very small percentage of people and is safe to mix. if you are really worried take the nyquil but use one-third less than the dose suggested on the nyquil bottle.

Question: can prostatitis cause redness on the tip of the penis? . experiencing pain/soreness and sensitivity on penis head also redness sometimes. i have been told it may be prostatitis but i am beginning to worry it is something worse (herpes? ). gonnohrea and chlamydia tests negative. has not responded to cipro after 3 weeks of treatment.
Answer: hi if you think you have gonorrhea and chlydia then you should see your doctor and get tested for it. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: prostatitis should not cause redness/soreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct. there is likely another cause. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet based solely on your very brief description. you will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this redness/soreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis. you may want to consider seeing a urologist. it's probably just some ordinary skin irritation. try using a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it specializes in penis skin issues like this and will get things back to normal quickly and safely. it was a good move to get an std test. you can rule that stuff out. try the creme!
================================================================================
Question: what should liver counts be? . my liver count is 219. i want to know what the normal range is and what is considered high and low for a liver count.
Answer: hi if you have a high liver count then you can get a high blood pressure. if you are having a low blood pressure then you should get a good blood pressure test done. good luck
Expected Response: there is really no such lab test as a liver count. there are specific liver tests like the alt ast etc. that all have their individula lab normal ranges. please review your test results again or specific ask which of these liver enzyme tests have a value of 219
================================================================================
Question: can hot baths or spas help alleviate arthritis pain?
Answer: spas are not a cure for arthritis but they can help prevent or reduce pain. spas can also be used to treat other conditions such as arthritis or asthma.
Expected Response: many people with arthritis find good relief from pain and stiffness with hot baths or spas. the moist heat increases muscle relaxation boosts blood supply to the site of pain and relieves rigidity and spasms in the muscles. but avoid hot tubs or spas if you have diabetes high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease or if you are pregnant.

Question: how is coronary artery disease treated?
Answer: coronary artery diseases are treated with medications and lifestyle changes. however most of the time the disease is treated with lifestyle changes such as reducing smoking and avoiding certain foods and beverages. the disease can be treated with medication. some people with coronary artery disorders may need to take lifestyle changes to prevent the disease. if you have a family history of coronary artery disorder or are a smoker or have other health problems that may affect your health you should talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes that may help prevent or treat the disease such as using a smoke detector or using a new cigarette. talk with your doctor if you: have a history of heart disease or are at risk for heart disease. have a high blood pressure. have diabetes. have high blood cholesterol. have congestive heart failure. have heart failure in the lungs. have other conditions that may increase your risk for coronary artery problems such as heart disease heart disease stroke heart disease and heart disease in the arteries. if your
Expected Response: medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen to compensate for the reduced blood supply. three commonly used classes of drugs are the nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. nitroglycerin (nitro-bid) is an example of a nitrate. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) and atenolol (tenormin). examples of calcium blockers include nicardipine (cardene) and nifedipine (procardia adalat). unstable angina is also treated with aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. aspirin prevents clumping of platelets while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. when patients continue to have angina despite taking maximum medications or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing they usually need coronary arteriography. during coronary arteriography doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for percutaneous coronary intervention or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (ptca) where a small balloon is used to inflate the blockage. angioplasty (ptca) is usually followed by placement of a stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) to increase coronary artery blood flow. angioplasty can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. under x-ray guidance a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. a small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. the balloon is then inflated to push the artery open and a steel mesh stent is generally inserted. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (ptca). cabg surgery is ideal for patients with many narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.

Question: why is my genital boil bleeding after i put ointment on it? should i stop using this particular medication? . i have a genital boil (i know it's not warts or herpes because i am not sexually active). it is painful so i put neosporin +pain relief gel on it and the next time i went into the bathroom i found it was bleeding thought it wasn't before i put the ointment on it. should i be worried?
Answer: hi you need to go see your doctor for a blood test and a test for herpes. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: is the medicine zovirax or something like that? do you have pills also? do you think you could have washed in the shower a little too roughly? when i've gotten them (mine are actually herpes but called them boils for years because my husband wouldn't accept it until i made him go with me for a test last year). i do realize we get regular ole boils also. however i've never heard of bleeding. if the sore is currently open i would stop the medicine for a day then start back again and see how it does. alternatively i wish you could see or talk to a nurse or dr. but if you're on here you may not be able to do that. another thing i've found soothing is putting a warm chamomile tea bag on there for 1/2 hour; i got that from hubby- he brings me a bowl of hot water to keep rinsing & "steeping" the tea bag. when you wash just blot with a clean cloth (don't re-use until washed) / water only until healed better. the emergency room taught me that because i became allergic to soap & all ointments when i had any infections etc. it helps alot.

Question: i have or think i have hair loss when should i contact my doctor?
Answer: you should call your doctor right away if you notice a change in your hair color or hair loss. it is important to call your hair care provider right away to discuss your symptoms and treatment options.

Expected Response: there has been much advancement to assist with complying with a gluten-free diet. the food allergen labeling and consumer protection act requires manufacturers to provide more information about the ingredients used to make their food products by specifying the presence of allergens on the product label including wheat. wheat-free does not mean gluten-free so you will still need to read the rest of the ingredients.

Question: can taking clarithromycin 500 mg make my ulcer pain worse?
Answer: there is no evidence that clarithromax will cause ulcerative colitis. clarithrozole is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it is not used to treat ulcers or other inflammatory bowel diseases. claritin is a generic name for a class of drugs called anti-diarrheal medications. it is available over the counter.
Expected Response: just like many antibiotics clarithromycin can cause upset stomach nausea vomiting and diarrhea. however there isn’t any contraindication regarding a history of ulcers when taking this medication. if you are taking any ulcer medications it would be important to check with your pharmacist to make sure there aren’t any drug interactions that would decrease the effectiveness of your ulcer medication which would cause flare-ups. the medication can be taken with or without food. if the upset stomach is present try taking it with food to see if it subsides. if at any point it worsens you should consult your health-care provider to see if another medication is better for you.

Question: doxycycline potential liver damage. i don't drink smoke or have any vice. i get annual exams and my liver always checks good. about a week before my annual exam this year i had just completed a two therapy of doxycycline and my liver values alt and ast were out of range. alt was 6 points out of range and ast was 9 points out of range. . is this possible stress from the antibiotic cycle? are these values high or demonstrating damage to be concerned about? . . thank you.
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm sure you're wondering why you're taking a drug test. the answer is simple: you're not taking any medication at this point. you're just taking a test to see if you can safely take it. if you're concerned about your liver values or your risk of liver damage it's important to talk to your doctor about your concerns. he or she can help you make an informed decision.
Expected Response: any anti-biotic used long term can cause liver damage.

Question: if someone is allergic to formaldehyde where can i find a list of products that do not have it?
Answer: there are several different types of formaldehyde. the most common type is formaldehyde-causing formaldehyde (formaldehyde-cayenne) which is a mixture of formic acid and acetaldehyde. formaldehyde is most commonly found in the form of formulae (bactrim) and bactrim is found in formaldehyde derivatives (such as formic acids). there are also forms of formyl acetyl acetate (formyl acetamide) and formyl methyl acetate which are both formyl-acetyl and formamide-cateol. formyl is also found in other forms of formsaldehyde such as formyl glucosamine (formol glucosine) and formsyl glucose (formols glucosylates) and also in other formaldehyde products such as acetaminophen (tylenol acetaminosine and acetamin
Expected Response: formaldehyde sensitivity (causing a rash) is typically diagnosed by patch testing on the skin. if you are found to have a contact allergy avoidance of that item is recommend. there are several other preservatives that are also formaldehyde releasers. these include quaternium-15 imidazolidinyl urea diazolidinyl urea dmdm hydantoin and bronopol. in many cases i recommend avoiding all of these if patch testing is positive to formaldehyde. your doctor can help you decide if the formaldehyde releasers should also be avoided. also your skin doctor may have access to the contact allergen replacement database (card) which can assist in generating lists of products that do not contain certain products in them (such as formaldehyde).

Question: i went to the doctor and am being treated for strep but after three days of antibiotics. i still have spots in my throat and i am still in a lot of pain. i am very nauseous. i can't breathe. i have a sore throat and a sore tongue. i also have a lot more pain than usual. i don't know what to do. i need help.
Answer: hi i think you should go see your doctor and see what he can do for you. good luck
Expected Response: unless your doctor actually did a test (rapid strep test or culture) to confirm that you have strep the diagnosis could be incorrect. you may have a viral infection or even mono. obviously since i can't examine you i have no way of making that important diagnostic call. most viral infections improve on day four (even if you do nothing) so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again.

Question: i am eligible for medicare on feb. 1. can my company deduct for health insurance that i will never use? . my company is requiring that i be given insurance under the aca. i will be receiving and paying for medicare by february 1 2014. not only that but the plan that my company wants to provide has a deductible of $5 000. if i refuse that same $400 will be deposited into a 401k plan. again keep in mind that i am going to be 65 on feb. 2.
Answer: you are not eligible for a medicare subsidy. if you have medicare you will not be able to purchase insurance through the marketplace. you will be required to buy insurance through your state's health insurance exchange.
Expected Response: medicare counts as qualifying insurance coverage and once you're eligible you won't need any additional insurance. you also have the right to turn down your employer's offer of insurance -- they can't force you to buy it. once you have medicare (make sure you sign up for parts a b and c to be fully covered) you can drop your employer's insurance if you feel the coverage is too expensive for you.

Question: what is the ball at the vagina opening. i am 60 very healthy do 1/2 marathons. lately i feel like something is at the vagina opening. i do not do self exams. i thought it was a swollen urethra. my doctor is on vacation so i went to a walk in clinic. said i was fine. but when i look in the mirror there is a pink large ball at the entrance with a dimple on it. it feels like it is coming out. all the clinic would do is said see a gyno. no referral. can you tell me what this might be. still nervous plus i have a race in 4 weeks.

Expected Response: you may have a prolapsed uterus and this "ball with a dimple on it" may be your cervix protruding from your vagina. your gynecologist or even a primary care medical provider can confirm this most-likely diagnosis.

Question: my 2 month old grand daughter cries as if she is in pain and it happens more often in the evenings is this normal? . this to me is not a normal "fussy" cry we have asked the dr and they said it's normal but i don't agree and want to push the issue but don't know where to start it started when she was about a month old.
Answer: you should see your pediatrician. the sooner you can get the diagnosis and treatment of grand mal seizures the better. i wish you all the best!
Expected Response: the rule of threes : a child over three weeks old and under three months who cries more than three hours a day (mostly in the evening) more than three days a week. does this fit your grand-daughter's pattern? the may have colic. if so the good news is that it may miraculously disappear soon after age three. colic remains a mysterious pediatric problem that has plagued sleep-deprived parents for ages. as a seasoned parent yourself your kids may not have had it. colicy kids can scream for hours and drive new parents (and grandmothers) wacky. obviously this is just a blind guess over the internet but i have seen this zillions of times in my primary care pediatric practice. yes there could be other reasons but since her doctor did not find a reason colic is definitely on the possibility table. do an internet search on colic. use only medical sites please like webmd or the american academy of pediatrics.

Question: do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?
Answer: most helpful answer blackheads are caused by an enzyme called histamine which is produced by the skin. it is not a fungus. blackheads can be caused by many things including: allergies. there are many reasons for blackheads. some of them include: an enlarged prostate gland. a buildup of red blood cells. a reaction to the chemical substances in your blood. a blood clot. a condition called a blood clots. an enlarged lymph node. a rash. a fever. a cold. a cough. a sore throat. a red rash on the skin or a bump on your skin. a bump that looks like a pimple. a lump on your scalp. a swollen lymph node or bump. a skin infection. a yeast infection. an infection of the skin with a fungus called a strep. a fungus can also cause blackheads by causing a fungus that is resistant to a certain antibiotic. a certain
Expected Response: the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.

Question: how long does sperm live outside of body. how long does sperm live outside the body. like on clothing and bed sheets.
Answer: hi if you google sperm and clothing you will find lots of info on this. but i think you need to see your doctor. good luck
Expected Response: sperm will not live on clothing or bed sheets. when it has "dried" it has "died". sperm that is properly frozen (cytogenetically) can live for years under proper conditions so technically this is consider out of the body too. you don't really have to worry about clothing sperm stains. those little tadpole-like organisms do not last long (only a few minutes) outside the body nor do they swim around looking for vaginas. semen-containing sperm is viable in or near the vaginal area so suggest that your sperm-making friend use a condom. even when you are must playing around.

Question: is there pain wiht pancrea cancer. if diagnosed wiht pancrea & liver cancer can a person still live the remaider of their lives wihtout pain. there is currently no pain. could one go home and just keep living their normal life until death comes? . . .
Answer: hi just google pancrea and liver cancer and you will find lots of info and lots of links to help you find out whats going on. good luck
Expected Response: pancreatic cancer is a terrible terrible cancer and yes it is typically fatal. one of my best friends had pancreatic cancer (a medical provider) and described the pain as "indescribable". he had to have a careful balance between pain control with over-sedation (and constipation from the opiates) to the point where he could not function and just mentally dealing with the pain without the use of medications (very difficult). much of the cancer pain is related to metastasis (the spreading of the cancer to bone and other organs). it would be wonderful to have any remaining time pain-free but sadly this may not happen. as long as this person is currently pain-free now they are being blessed.

Answer: you need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

Question: why do teens need at least eight hours of sleep?
Answer: the answer is yes. teens need eight hours or more of sleep every night.
Expected Response: does your teen get fewer than eight hours? if so listen up: your teen is more at risk for obesity and all the health problems connected to that (high blood pressure heart disease stroke etc. ). the link between sleep deprivation and a higher risk for obesity and related cardiovascular problems may not seem obvious. but here’s the key: when you’re sleep deprived (and yes for the vast majority of teens fewer than eight hours on a regular basis qualifies as being sleep deprived) you’ll crave high carbohydrate foods — especially those that are loaded with fat salt and sugar. i know it’s not fair to crave junk food when we’re already lacking in the sleep department but you can blame our ancient dna on this fact. encoded in our genes are signals to eat like this when we’re tired. hormones that control our signals of hunger and conversely fullness get thrown out of whack when we are sleep deprived. in a new study published this month in the journal sleep researchers determined that teens can’t escape this hard-wired reality that adults are saddled with. though plenty of studies in recent years have implicated obesity with sleep deprivation in adults not many have been performed on younger generations to find similar associations. in this latest study researchers found sleep-deprived teens: * consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fat. * ate more snacks than those who slept eight hours or more a night. * ate more total calories. and you know what that spells: weight gain. when we think of adolescents losing out on sleep our minds quickly turn to potential accidents and an inability to concentrate or perform well in school. studies like this highlight the health consequences of sleep deprivation. the health repercussions of sleep deprivation at this “tender” age may actually be worse than those of an adult. for starters teens are establishing habits they will keep for a lifetime. a teen who gets used to eating poorly and packing on the pounds will likely grow into an overweight adult when it’ll be that much harder to change those habits and lose the excess weight. the more fatty foods you eat the more you crave them. secondly we’re only beginning to understand the biomechanics of a developing person’s metabolism. do teens who begin to have metabolic disturbances early in life suffer from a lifetime of irreversible higher health risks? it wouldn’t surprise me. and those higher risks may go far beyond just obesity and cardiovascular challenges. they may in fact go as far as upping the risk for cancer. so thirdly it’s a foregone conclusion: teens need their sleep as much as adults do.

Question: what causes stomach pain and swelling after eating every meal? been this way for 3 weeks. it started out about 3 weeks ago. i have stomach pains and severe swelling after i eat. then a couple days later i got my period and it seems my swelling is not as bad. so i went to the docter and he thought it was my gallbladder. i had blood work done normal. sent me for ultrasound normal. then hida scan normal. still having problems everytime i eat my stomach starts hurting really bad and my stomach swells some. my stomach is constanly sore. .
Answer: hi this is from the uk’s nhs you should get your doctor's advice on what's causing your symptoms. good luck
Expected Response: the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed. i am having the same problem. my stomach is so tender and sore. i have excruciating pain. i have had a lot of test and all the doctors said was gastritis and colitis. i am not taking any medication for this and just wondering what i should do. i can't live in this kind of pain. there should be some kind of cure for this. i don't have diarrhea or sick stomach. i had a lot of stomach issues i was diagnosed with h pylori it is a bacterial infection in the stomach my gastroenterologist did a breathing test to find that i had a very severe case this was after 3 ct scans an endoscope and a colonoscopy! ask your doctor about diverticulitis.

Question: when a woman is pregnant for 9 months does she save 9 eggs for 9 future ovulations?
Answer: it depends on how long the pregnancy has been occurring. if you are pregnant for a year or more then you are at risk of having a miscarriage. if your baby is stillborn you may not be able to get pregnant again until you have had a miscarriage for at least 9 months. if a woman has had a miscarried baby for more than 9 months she will need to have a new baby.
Expected Response: thank you for the interesting question. i completely understand your logic. the laws are changing every day in the field of fertility. in the lab setting it has become common practice to increase the number of potentially viable eggs therby expanding the odds of pregnancy occurring. another example of these changes may be seen in the long held belief that a woman is born with a finite quantity of eggs at birth. this principle is being questioned in an animal study. please open the following link to a webmd article that discusses that study. <link> - although i’m not an expert in fertility issues i’ll share with you what i know to be accurate as follows: the number of follicles that will ever become a mature egg is partially dependent on the monthly cycle where a varying and undetermined number of follicles (potentially mature eggs) estimated to probably be in the neighborhood of 1 000 is lost. this follicle loss is also influenced by hormonal variations. the number of follicles remaining each month after the monthly cycle will influence the potential number of mature eggs in a woman’s lifetime. the more follicles that are lost monthly the sooner that the follicle supply will become exhausted and menopause will begin. with all of the advances in fertility it does not seen yet possible to calculate the number of remaining mature eggs after the monthly cycle.

Question: how does scoliosis affect the immune system? . my daughter was born with spina bifida occulta. her cord is tethered but did not protrude or leave a whole at birth. after chronic pain she it was found at 3 yrs old. at 4 she was diagnosed with scoliosis the dr said it was attributed to the spina bifida. she also has severe asthma and allergies to food medications and pollen/dust/etc. how do these affect her immune system and why? . she is often absent from school and stays sick for longer periods of time.
Answer: hi this link should help you find out what is causing your symptoms. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: scoliosis as an independent entity does not change the immune system it is just a developmental anomaly shared by many. this is not to say that your daughter does not have an immune problem due to something else so her doctor would be the best judge of this -- someone who knows her complete medical history. her allergies and asthma and some of the medications used to control it can certainly have an influence but not the scoliosis.

Question: can you get hand foot and mouth disease more than once? . my 11 month son was diagnosed with this today and his doctor acted as if you can only contract this once although she did not specifically say that. she told me that children over the age of 4 are usually spared as they have most likely already had the disease in the past. i have never had this nor has my husband or my two daughters (10 and 5). just looking for any extra precautions that i may need to take.
Answer: i am sorry to hear you are going through this. it is a very difficult time for your son. it sounds like you are having hand foot disease. it can be very difficult to get hands-on treatment for this condition. it may take a few days to get rid of the disease but it can take a while. there is a lot of information online about hand foot foot disease and it is not uncommon to get the condition treated. if you are able to get a hands-only
Expected Response: most helpful answer exposure to an infectious disease like hand foot and mouth disease does not automatically mean that the exposed person will get it. your children may be at mild risk not likely you or your husband. the vast majority of children will not get hand foot and mouth disease ever again however there can be very rare cases when those skin lesions will surface again (milder the second time). this can be due to another similar viral species that causes identical skin lesions or a rare reactivation of the prior infection.

Expected Response: if the symptoms last for more than 24 hours if the diagnosis is uncertain if there is concern about dehydration or if the patient has underlying medical conditions that make them more fragile medical care should be accessed sooner rather than later. infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration and may not have as much reserve as an adult. if there is concern about dehydration or the inability to tolerate fluids a healthcare provider should be contacted. if nausea and vomiting are associated with pain fever vomiting blood or having bloody or black tarry bowel movements medical care should be sought immediately. vomiting is a symptom of an illness and is not a disease in itself. if the symptom persists for more than 24 ro 48 hours it may be wise to contact a medical care provider.

Question: what could cause a very sudden onset of nausea dizziness and feeling off balance? no lead in not on any meds. thx! . it's mostly cleared up about 2 hours later. i was driving at onset and when i got out of the car i also had some trouble walking -- fine for a few steps and then i'd stagger for a couple. i didn't have any other symptoms until about 2 days later. it's been about a week now and i'm still not 100%. i'm not sure if this is a side effect or not.
Answer: you may be experiencing a "headache" in the area of your back. the cause of this is unknown. it could be a nerve issue or a muscle strain. it would be wise to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
Expected Response: your experience could have been caused by literally dozens of conditions. some of the possibilities include: stroke; transient ischemic attack (tia); vertigo; syncope; inner ear disturbance; medication side effect; diabetic event; and heart irregularities. i suggest that you start off by seeing your family doctor. that person knows your medical history best and can begin a basic investigation by way of diagnostic testing. additionally the family doctor may refer you to other medical specialists including a cardiologist and neurologist.

Question: why do some people get a lot of warts and others don’t?
Answer: the most common cause of wart is a yeast infection. yeast infections can be caused by a variety of things including: a yeast-causing bacterium called a strep. yeast infection is more common in people with strep than in people without strep but it is not as common in women. a yeast virus called a staphylococcus aureus. the bacteria can cause warts in people who have strep or who have been exposed to strep before. yeast is a common cause for bacterial vaginosis (bv) in women but it can also be caused in people.
Expected Response: doctors aren’t sure but they believe that certain individuals have immune systems that are more able to fight off the viruses and prevent warts from growing. also just as some people are more likely to get poison ivy the genetic makeups and immune systems of certain individuals make them more susceptible to the viruses that cause skin warts. it is also common to see warts on multiple siblings in the same family. and children of people who had skin warts as children are often quite susceptible to skin warts themselves says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. still experts have yet to determine exactly what is different in the immune systems of people who get skin warts frequently.

Question: how can i handle headaches during pregnancy?
Answer: most women experience headaches during the first trimester of pregnancy. however some women experience nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. nausea and/or vomiting may occur during pregnancy if the fetus is not fully formed and the fetus has a fever. nausea is a symptom of a variety of conditions including anaphylaxis (a condition in which the body produces antibodies to attack the fetus) or anaphysis (a rare condition in the fetus that causes the body to produce antibodies to destroy the fetus). some women also experience nausea during pregnancy during pregnancy when the fetus does not fully develop. nausea may be accompanied by vomiting and may also be accompanied with diarrhea. nausea during the third trimester may be associated with a higher risk of developing a urinary tract infection (uti). if you have a urinary infection during pregnancy you should talk to your doctor about the symptoms and possible treatment options.
Expected Response: headaches can be caused by tension congestion constipation or in some cases preeclampsia. they can occur anytime during pregnancy. recommendations: apply an ice pack to your forehead or the back of your neck. rest sit or lie quietly in a low-lit room. close your eyes and try to release the tension in your back neck and shoulders. try tylenol (acetaminophen) occasionally. stay away from ibuprofen and other aspirin-like anti-inflammatories (nsaids) since these reduce amniotic fluid and can also thin your blood which could make it harder to stop bleeding during delivery. ask your health-care provider before taking any other medications for your headaches. contact your health-care provider if you have nausea with your headaches if your headache is severe and does not go away or if you have blurry vision double vision or blind spots.

Question: my wisdom teeth have come in and are beginning to rot. if they don't become infected will they fall out? . will the nerve die? or if the tooth is gone will the root still hurt?
Answer: yes it will. there are many reasons for this. the root is a nerve that travels from the tooth to the tooth. the roots of the tooth are not attached to the root. the tooth may be stuck in the root canal or the tooth will become infected. the infection is not caused by the tooth but by the root itself.
Expected Response: it sounds like a deteriorating situation to me. the teeth will not fall out the remaining teeth or roots can get infected and cause big problems. i would get to an oral surgeon as soon as possible to properly assess the situation and to hopefully prevent major infection and problems.

Question: do apples contain caffeine? . i've heard recently that apples contain caffeine. is this true?
Answer: most helpful answer the answer is no. apples are not caffeine-free.
Expected Response: no apples don’t contain any caffeine. there’s a widely held but false belief that apples are better than coffee at waking you up in the morning. i think that this claim was misconstrued and resulted in someone believing that apples contain caffeine. the theory is that the fructose (simple sugar) in apples is responsible in helping you wake up though i couldn’t find any research to support this or suggest that apples are better than coffee at waking you up. nutrient-rich there are many health benefits to consuming fruits like apples on a regular basis. helping you to wake up in the morning however may not be one of them. if you’re still curious try it for yourself to see if it can help you feel more alert after waking up. hi this is how it should read. nutrition of an apple serving size 182 grams (1 medium apple) calories 95 sugar 19 protein 0. 5mg vitamin c 8. 4mg vitamina 98. 3iu folate 5. 5mcg choline 6. 2mcg calcium 10. 9mg phosphorus 20mg potassium 195mg caffeine 0mg apples also contain very small traces of other vitamins and minerals. hi the answer you looking for read this. nutrition of an apple serving size 182 grams (1 medium apple) calories 95 sugar 19 protein 0. 5mg vitamin c 8. 4mg vitamin a 98. 3 iu folate 5. 5mcg choline 6. 2mcg calcium 10. 9mg phosphorus 20mg potassium 195mg caffeine 0mg apples also contain very small traces of other vitamins and minerals. so as you can see no. good luck

Question: is there a medical term for scarlet fever?
Answer: scarlet fevers are caused by viruses. viruses can cause scarlet disease but not fever.
Expected Response: strangely enough that is the medical term used by most clinicians. it is a billable code with an icd-9 classification. scarlet fever is due to strep -- the same bacteria that causes strep throat. it is not considered any more dangerous if promptly and accurately diagnosed and treated. the rash of scarlet fever is called a scarletiniform streptococcal eruption if you want a different term. it is bright red (hence the name) and sandpapery rough. later the rash can desquamate (peel) like a sunburn.

Question: what is the differnce between an ovarian cyst and tumor?
Answer: the most common type of ovarian cysts are benign and benign. the cysts that are more common in the early stages of ovarian cancer are called benign and malignant. they are usually caused by a protein called anastomosis. these benign ovarian cystic cysts can be caused by any of the following: anastomyosis (an enlarged cyst) cystic ovarian cystancyst (an abnormal cyst in the middle part of the ovary) ovarian cytopathic cyst (a cyst that is not enlarged) ovarian cancer (an ovarian cytic disease) ovarian biopsy (an examination of the lining of the uterus to see if the lining is enlarged) cyst of the testicle (a testicle that is enlarged and enlarged) cancer of the prostate (a prostate cancer) cancer in the prostate gland (a cancer of a gland in the gland) cancerous cyst
Expected Response: a tumor is a solid mass; a cyst is a mass filled with fluid.

Question: what is orthostatic hypotension?
Answer: orthostasis is a condition in which the body's tissues become inflamed. this is caused by a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the body. if your body's tissue is inflamed the blood vessels in your blood vessels are blocked and your blood pressure goes down. this can lead to a decrease in blood flow to your heart. orthostactic hypotension can be caused by many conditions including: obesity. obesity can be a symptom of orthostasyphaly. diabetes. heart disease. certain conditions can cause orthostactyl hypotension. some of these conditions include: high blood pressure. certain people can develop orthostathema (high blood pressure) while others can develop it without symptoms. diabetes is a common cause of orthoarthritis.
Expected Response: when a person stands up from sitting or lying down the body must work to adjust to that change in position. it is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. if the body fails to do this adequately blood pressure falls and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure). adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: a heart strong enough to pump. arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze. enough blood and fluid within the vessels. when the body changes position a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the cardiovascular system as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. the autonomic nervous system can be considered to "run in the background" of the body regulating body processes that we take for granted. there is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speed things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. these names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster your palms get sweaty your eyes dilate and your hair stands on end. acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. these two systems are in balance and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day. when the body moves to a standing position pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity which causes blood to flow towards the legs. almost immediately the sympathetic system is stimulated causing the heart rate to increase the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully and blood vessels to constrict or narrow. all of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs. without these changes gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain causing symptoms of lightheadedness or even passing out. orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness.

Question: do boys with measles become sterile? . my son has measles and is now a healthy adult. he is now in the hospital for a cold. he has been diagnosed with measles and has been taking a vaccination. he also has been told that his immune system is functioning well. he doesn't want to go to the hospital. he says that he has a sore throat and is scared to go.
Answer: hi just google measles and how to get rid of it and get rid your kids. but the only way to get your kids vaccinated is to get vaccinated. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: no not necessarily. actually it is mumps not measles that has a predilection for causing problems in the gonads. complications of measles tend to be more central nervous system / neurological. namely things like meningitis. i guess it would be possible for a severe case of measles to cause issues with the reproductive tract but this would not likely be a common complication. worldwide measles remains among the leading causes of childhood deaths. this is why vaccination is so so important.

Question: what are the different surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist?
Answer: there are several different surgical techniques for treating arthritis of hand and hand. the most common surgical approach is the use of a rotator cuff. the rotator cuffs are used to relieve arthritis of both hands. the cuff is made of flexible material that is attached to the wrist and is used to hold the rotated joint. the flexible material is then stretched over the joint and the joint is reattached to the rotating joint. in addition the cuff can be used to support the rotatory joint. a rotating cuff is also called a "stretched rotator. " the rotators are also called "stretched wrist. "
Expected Response: treatment/surgery for painful arthritic fingers and how to prevent further deterioration

Answer: hi if you have been on birthcontrol then you could be. if you are having unprotected sex then you should be ok. good luck
Expected Response: if you have been off birth control having unprotected sex and now experiencing no period breast pain and nausea. then of course you could be pregnant. there can be certainly be other reasons to account for your array of symptoms but pregnancy would be high on the list and would need to be considered first.

Question: what are neutrophils?
Answer: neutrophil counts are the number of neutrophill cells that are present in the body. neutrophilia is the most common type of cancer in the u. s. about 1 in every 1 000 people. the number is also the most important factor in determining the risk of developing cancer.
Expected Response: neutrophils are a type of white blood cell which fight infections. neutrophils circulate through the blood and are normally detected on routine complete blood count (cbc) tests as part of the white blood cell count. many more neutrophils are on standby in the bone marrow and clinging to blood vessel walls to be released into the blood if needed. neutrophils are the “first responders” when the body is invaded by bacteria viruses or other organisms. guided by chemical signaling they travel to the area of infection and attack. neutrophils contain tiny compartments called granules in which they store toxic chemicals that act as their weapons against microorganisms. these substances are effective at killing bacteria and viruses but also contribute to inflammation with swelling redness and often pain. a low neutrophil count can be caused by drugs (especially chemotherapy) immune disorders and problems in the bone marrow. a very low neutrophil count increases the risk of serious infection.

Question: can your lungs be clear with pneumonia? . my mother is 73 years old. she has a history of copd etc. she was in the hospital from 11/13 to 11/16 with pneumonia. she was not getting better in fact she was declining. they kept saying her lungs were clear. she went to the er last night. she has been admitted with pneumonia again much worse than before. can your lungs be clear with pneumonia?
Answer: no. pneumonia is not a viral infection. it is a bacterial infection. pneumonia does not cause pneumonia. pneumonia can be caused by viruses or bacteria.
Expected Response: the word "clear" may be referring to two things: one would be listening to the lungs and not hearing any abnormal sounds like crackling that would indicate pneumonia. another would be a clear x-ray; pneumonia not being radiologically proven. it is nice to have both to prove the diagnosis but medical provider often treat things provisionally (feeling they are high risk like your mother and likely to get pneumonia) or clinically (having all of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia without any confirmation). your mother may have been admitted because of her age her medical history and the fact that she was getting worse. pneumonia may just be the admitting diagnosis but may not end up being her final diagnosis.

Question: are there any health related issues later on in life for preemies? i was 4lbs born in 1947. my dad was a very good athlete. i was 5'11" and weigh 140lbs. my mom was a little overweight. my sister was a bit overweight. i'm wondering if there is any health issues later in life that would make me overweight later on?
Answer: hi if you think you have been overweight then your in the right place to start with its a good idea to have a look at this link from the uk's nhs its the link <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck
Expected Response: you are 65 years old or close to it. you made it to retirement and are eligible for social security. the fact that you weighed four pounds in 1947 is probably irrelevant right now. if you had any consequences are a result of your premature birth they would have been obvious at that time. certainly not now.

Question: i am always feeling itchy on my face and my back. i have brown patches on my back and face(am black). i am not sure what it is. i am very paranoid and have tried to get rid of it but it doesn't work. i also have a rash on my upper back and upper back that is not very painful. it is very hard to get out of.
Answer: i have a lot of questions about this. i would suggest you call your dermatologist.
Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. feeling itchy all the time is very annoying! unfortunately this is the type of thing that can only be diagnosed through a physical examination. so many conditions from eczema to simple dry skin can cause the symptoms you're describing. you can get on the path to diagnosis by visiting your primary care provider (pcp). he or she is in the best position to determine if your symptoms are skin issues or reflect an underlying health problem. if necessary your pcp will refer you to a specialist for treatment. i hope this helps!

Question: can methylpredisolone tablets cause the recent outbreak of meningitis in which the man has a rash. the rash is very painful and lasts for several days. the man is taking the methylpredolone tablets and has a fever of 101. 7.
Answer: hi have a good read through this link from the uk's nhs you should find lots of info on this link <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: the ongoing meningitis outbreak is scary and people are very confused about its cause. the current fungal meningitis outbreak is related to contaminated vials of an injectable steroid preparation called methylprednisolone acetate which is used to treat spinal pain. that means the people currently affected by fungal meningitis are those who received injections from a tainted vial of steroid preparation. (note: the investigation into this situation is ongoing and more medications may have been implicated by the time you read this. ) in addition to date all of the contaminated product has been linked to a single compounding pharmacy called new england compounding center (necc). all products made by necc are currently under recall by the food and drug administration. methylprednisolone oral tablets also are a steroid compound. these tablets are used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions among other things. to date methylprednisolone tablets have not been linked to any cases of fungal meningitis. as long as your tablets didn't come from necc (which is probably the case; most methylprednisolone tablets are mass-produced in factories) you should be safe. if you have any concerns about this contact your pharmacist or the prescribing physician. i hope you find this information useful.

Question: what is jc virus? . my dr. said one of my medications i can take for ms could cause this jc virus?
Answer: the answer is no. there is no link between jc and jcv. jcv is a virus that causes jock itch and other skin infections.
Expected Response: that's a really good question. basically it's a normally harmless virus that most people already have but immune suppressing drugs can cause it to reactivate and do damage. here's a link to a wiki article about it: <link> and a link to an article about the risks to ms patients: <link>#3

Question: almost 12 y/o boy complaining of tenderness at and around the nipple area upon touch. is this normal? . diagnosed with asthma @ 4 months. controlled with qvar inhaler. otherwise in good health.
Answer: hi as you may know the symptoms of asthma are caused by a virus. so if you have a cold or a cough then the symptoms may be caused by your cold. but if you are having a fever then you may have a virus or something else. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: very normal. this is most likely adolescent gynecomastia (you can find lots of information on this temporary condition from webmd or a google search). tender nipples or getting breast development can be frightening during puberty. while this condition is temporary it can last for a few years involve both breasts and will keep his shirt on for a while. let him read what you find on the internet and assure him that he is not alone. i see this every week in our adolescent clinic. this is just raging hormones. males have both male and female hormones and this is just a response from the female hormone. his male hormones (testosterone) will still be prevalent. gynecomastia can create very tender breasts so just bumping in to them or having his peers or sibling tease him can be emotionally painful. be nice. don't tease or let anyone else do it either. if he wants to wear a shirt in the swimming pool let him. if you look around there are many other teens wearing shirts too. this is not just to protect their back from sun. they may have some breast development as well.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe to give a 2 month old pedialyte on a daily basis?
Answer: pedialieste is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions including asthma bronchitis bronchodilators and asthma. it is important to note that pedialieceste is not a cure for asthma. however it is a safe treatment for many conditions.
Expected Response: there may be some reason that the pediatrician would suggest this but in general we recommend breastmilk or formula exclusively at that age. my rationale is that there are only so many ounces in a day that a 2 month old will consume so you might as well offer some calories.
================================================================================
Question: variose veins on my left testicle? . hi im 17 years old and i have large varicose looking veins on my left testicle. they don't cause me any pain or bother or interfere with things in any way they're just ugly looking. i've had them for as long as i can remember at least since i hit puberty. are they a problem? and will they cause any health problems in the future?
Answer: hi if you google this then its all you can do. but do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: you are most likely talking about varicoceles. this type of varicose veins are most common on the left side and in most cases will not cause any issues. however very large varicoceles have the potential to decrease your fertility by lowering your sperm count (on that side only). about 1 in 12 adolescent males have these things and they rarely require any medical intervention. to read more about them just put "adolescent varicoceles" in your google search engine.

Answer: hi its a bit early to say but the answer is yes your sperm will live in your womb for a while. good luck
Expected Response: sperm can remain alive and viable for about three to five days if protected in the cervical mucous. is it really that important on which day you became pregnant? if it is an exact date of conception may be a difficult to determine based solely on isolated days of unprotected sex.

Question: how can benign prostatic hyperplasia bph be prevented?
Answer: you can prevent bph by avoiding all sexual activity and sexual activities that are not harmful to the bph. however if you are sexually active and have bph you should not engage in sexual activity that is not harmful. if you have bp or have been treated for it you should also avoid sexual activity. if your doctor or health care provider recommends that you avoid sex you should talk to your doctor about whether or not you should have sex. you should discuss this with your doctor before having sex.
Expected Response: the urination problems caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) cannot be prevented. some people believe that regular ejaculations will help prevent prostate enlargement. but there is no scientific proof that ejaculation helps. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: i have severe sinus headaches that are unaffected by ibuprofen zyrtecd and a nasal steroid. i take a nasal steroid spray nearly year round and i take zyrtec d to try and keep myself from all the awful symptoms. recently though the zyrtec hasn't been clearing the nasal inflamation when i have a headache. i will then take ibuprofen on top of that and it fails to work on the aching pain in my nose eye cavities cheeks and upper gums. in the last few days my nose has started to go cold on top of everything else. i'd appreciate any ideas.
Answer: the nasal steroid is not a good choice for sinus congestion. it is not as effective as ibuprophen or zyrcid. the nasal steroids are a good source of a good nasal spray but they are not as good as ibupsrofen or zyprexa. if you are taking them for a chronic sinus
Expected Response: i recommend seeing your doctor. i have the same symptoms which for me is chronic sinus infection. see your doctor soon.
