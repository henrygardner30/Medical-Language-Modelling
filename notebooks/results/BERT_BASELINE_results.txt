Test Case 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Question:
what is delta hepatitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis b. the delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis d or hdv) is an rna virus meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. it is spread through exposure to contaminated blood especially with illicit intravenous drug use and by sexual contact. delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis b. when this happens infected people are quite sick but more than 95% are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. people who already have chronic hepatitis b can acquire delta hepatitis as well. this often causes severe inflammation of the liver and the viruses are less likely to be cleared. delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis b much worse. it increases the risk of complications especially cirrhosis which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. there is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. prevention includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners using barrier methods of contraception). universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis b vaccine effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis b virus.

the term "hepatitis" simply means inflammation of the liver. hepatitis may be caused by a virus or a toxin such as alcohol. other viruses that can cause injury to liver cells include the hepatitis a and hepatitis c viruses. these viruses are not related to each other or to hepatitis b virus and differ in their structure the ways they are spread among individuals the severity of symptoms they can cause the way they are treated and the outcome of the infection.

Patient Question:
who manufactures actos? my mother can’t afford it & sometimes skips her dose. do they offer an assistance program?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the manufacturer of actos is takeda pharmaceuticals. if you go to www. actos. com and click on "special offers" you will see three different types of programs to help with the cost of the medication. you are thinking the right way: if she skips her medication she will put herself in greater danger and may end up in the hospital -- which would definitely be a bigger bill. if you need help on locating these types of programs talk to your pharmacist; we are happy to help.

Patient Question:
can a breast feeding mother take dapakote. my daughter in law suffers from grand mal seizures and is taking seizure medication along with thyroid medication. she had thyroidectomy (thyroid removed 4 years ago and now the doctor has put her on dapakote er to manage her seizures migraine headaches and mood instability she refuses to take it in fear that it will her 3 month old baby boy that she is breast feeding. can the dapakote harm the baby? the doctor says no any input on this?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about 5% of valproate in the mother’s blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the baby’s bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck

Test Case 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Question:
what should i do when my baby starts teething and cries a lot?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a teething baby often likes to suck chew and gnaw on things. teething rings can help or often i’ll have parents get a washcloth wet then twist it or roll it up and put it in the freezer or fridge and once it’s cold let the baby chew on that. or you can try freezing a mini-bagel and let them chew on it -- but depending on how young they are you have to be careful keeping an eye on baby so that they don’t bite off a big piece. sometimes i’ll have a parent give a teething baby an appropriate dose of acetaminophen at night which helps soothe the baby and minimize the pain so the baby can sleep longer. i will say to be careful with topical solutions; be careful that you don’t overdo them. i’d recommend checking with your physician before you use them. try a refrigerated pacifier or teether. don't store the teether in the freezer because when frozen it can get hard enough to damage a baby's gums. there are a variety of refrigerated teethers including some with plastic handles so your baby's hands won't get cold. if nothing is working and your baby needs relief your doctor might recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. (note: don't give new medicines to a baby without first checking with a doctor. ask the doctor for the proper dosage whenever giving acetaminophen to a child younger than 2. ) your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth called primary teeth break through the gums. when does teething typically start? teething usually begins around 6 months of age. but it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. also find a good dental clinic which consists of experienced pediatricians who will help to give your child proper oral care. there are some great dental clinics which consists of services not only in child dentistry but also in other dental areas like cerec restoration dental implants neuromuscular dentistry and many more.

some infants are born with one or more teeth (called natal teeth) or may have teeth emerge within the first 30 days of life (called neonatal teeth). these usually are either extra teeth or are remnants from neonatal development that do not need treatment. if they are however actual teeth it's a good idea to maintain them. your doctor however may recommend removing them if the teeth are loose and pose a danger of being inhaled by your baby. early teeth may also interfere with feeding or irritate your baby's tongue. talk to your doctor to see what treatment is right for your baby.

Patient Question:
my 3 year old just had his tonsiles removed. and he refusing to drink. can giving him a bath help with hydration? . he will crunch on shaved ice but i don't think he is getting enough to drink. he is eating baby food which i assume has some water to it but not much. he is in a lot of pain and we want to make sure he gets enough fluid. will letting him soak in a bath help at all. i know drinking water or gatorade etc is best but looking for some alternatives.

Actual Doctor's Response:
unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.

Test Case 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Question:
do foods that have been pickled -- like canned beets -- still maintain their original nutritional value?

Actual Doctor's Response:
since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesn’t significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you don’t want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

generally speaking most injectors won't put hyaluronic acid into the neck because it's not effective. hyaluronic acid is commonly called a "dermal filler. " its purpose is to add volume to the face where the fat pads have naturally shrunken over time. when you add volume to your cheeks for example it tightens the skin and reduces the appearance of the large lines around the nose. the skin of the neck can become saggy over time and it would take a lot of dermal filler to tighten up this skin. depending on how loose the skin of the neck is you might consider a laser skin treatment or a neck lift. a laser treatment can significantly tighten the skin of the neck and make the surface of the skin look soft and new. a neck lift is a surgery that usually can be done on an outpatient basis. it might sound gruesome but patients i cared for told me it wasn't very painful and they were pleased with how it looked. if you're interested in any of these procedures your best bet (in my opinion) is to consult a cosmetic surgeon. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
finding the reason (or reasons) why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge. it could be teething. remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen. he doesn't have to have a fever to use it. if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem. children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods. the only problem is that they can't tell us. make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms. eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms. check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well.

the first thing to do after a bee or other insect sting is look at the skin. if there’s a stinger there pull it out. this will prevent the release of more venom into the skin and avoid a prolonged reaction to the stinger. people’s reactions after bee stings vary widely and so does the appropriate treatment. most people develop only a minor local reaction to a bee sting. redness and painful swelling up to around two inches across are normal. cold compresses and over-the-counter pain relievers are adequate treatment. about 10% of people develop what are called large local reactions. this is an ongoing reaction to the sting with a large area of inflamed painful swollen skin. the reaction and its symptoms can continue to get worse for 48 hours and take up to 10 days to resolve. call your doctor if symptoms are still getting worse a few hours after a sting or if the reaction looks alarming. prescription anti-inflammatory medicines like prednisone and topical steroids may help. at home cold compresses and over-the-counter pain medicines can also be used. the worst reaction to a bee sting is called a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. this is a whole-body life-threatening reaction to insect venom. it doesn’t occur often but when it does people often underestimate the seriousness of the symptoms: • itching or rash in areas of skin away from the sting. • hoarseness or shortness of breath. • lightheadedness. people can develop anaphylaxis even without a previous serious reaction to bee stings. if you have any of these symptoms of anaphylaxis after an insect sting seek immediate medical attention or call 911.

Patient Question:
why isn't my baby sleeping through the night?

Actual Doctor's Response:
is your baby sleeping through the night? it’s the question every parent of a newborn gets. how well does he or she sleep at night? and every new parent asks the other related question: when will my baby sleep through the night? ever? (never? ) no two babies are alike. that’s true when it comes to sleep as well. i’ve heard from parents whose babies sleep well like a baby — through the night — as early as six weeks old. and then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their baby’s birth. what gives? in the first few weeks of life babies don’t have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. this rhythm or body clock starts ticking at around six weeks of age. but what’s more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. in other words it’s not so much that babies are missing the “on” and “off” switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. it’s that babies cannot hold enough food (i. e. breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. it takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. and because breast milk in particular gets digested more quickly than formula moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. but here’s some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: a new study published in the journal pediatrics and done by researchers from the university of canterbury new zealand states that by the age of 5 months over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents’ sleeping times — and sleeping right through the night. sound too good to be true? well this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents’ sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. there’s a difference between a baby matching his or her parents’ sleeping schedule and sleeping “through the night. ” the researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long but its coinciding with the parents’ schedule takes longer. for example a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. but a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from say 11 p. m. to 5 a. m. may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. despite the statistics sometimes babies just don’t comply with what’s considered “average” or “normal. ” and sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. hopefully that’s sooner rather than later. but there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category — the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. here they are: * get a. m. light: make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. this will help set the body clock up and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * preserve nap time: babies nap routinely throughout the day usually once in the morning and another in the afternoon. though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to “save” sleep time for the night this will backfire. babies who get the full extent of their naps in sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. and they just might grow up smarter thanks to their naps. * cluster feed: to overcome the challenge of keeping your baby’s belly satiated through the night see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then “top-off” his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. that way he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * try the eat sleep play method: we used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. the key here is consistency in the schedule: if it is sleep time and you are out get home and get them to bed it will pay off. and for those who try everything and nothing works consult your pediatrician there could be reflux (sometimes called colic) or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. then be patient. one night your baby will surprise you. you’ll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. as you rush to the crib to check on your little one you realize that all is well. all are asleep. and so should you be too.

if you are a parent and your child is getting ready to return to school after a long stretch of vacation time you know that that the first week is typically a serious struggle. ever wonder why? a few reasons: * if you have a teenager their body clock naturally wants to stay up later and sleep in later so you are really going against nature on that one. * if your child had a later bedtime over the summer than during than the school year their sleep pressure (like hunger but for sleep) is less earlier in the evening rather than later and going to sleep at their “school year” bedtime will be harder. * finally remember there is always an adjustment period to any big change and it is often pretty painful. so how much sleep should your child get? * toddlers (1-3 years): 12-14 hours of sleep once they reach 18 months naps will decrease to once per day. * preschoolers (3-5 years): 11-13 hours they usually lose their nap by age 5. * school-aged kids (5-12 years): 10-11 hours. * teens (13-19 years): 9-10 hours. here are a few tips and tricks i have used with my patients over the years to make the transition from summer to school a bit smoother: * about 2 weeks before school starts have your child go to bed 15 minutes earlier than they normally do then after three days of this make it 30 minutes and so on until they are within 30 minutes of what should be their normal bedtime. * begin to limit or eliminate caffeine intake by about 2:30 p. m. many people do not know that caffeine can stay in your system for 10 hours (this includes energy drinks as well). check the label on some vitamin waters –- they may have caffeine. * even if you cannot get your children to go to bed any earlier (which you really should try) get them waking up closer and closer to their school time wake-up time. this will help provide an anchor to their already shifting biological rhythm. * exercising each day will certainly help their sleep so keep them outside as long as you can (use sunscreen) and in the pool so they will be nice and tired (particularly for younger children) for bed. remember to make the bedroom dark as in many cases you may be asking them to go to bed before the sun has completely set. * if they are into electronics in the evenings start to have them “unplugged and powered down” an hour before bed. have them relaxing reading and getting back into a bedtime routine.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's really important to have an aesthetic physician which would be a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to do these techniques and these treatments in order to have the most natural lasting results. these are treatments that are very technique sensitive. we have great ingredients. but they have to be done in the proper way in the proper plane of the skin so sometimes it's more superficial and sometimes it's deeper in the skin. we used different products for different parts of the face. so it is really important to see a doctor that you feel comfortable with to do these injections for you.

what if acetaminophen and ibuprofen doesn't bring down my fever? . i have a possible autoimmune disorder that has not been diagnosed as of yet. i frequently get fevers that range between 99 and 101 degrees along with chills and body aches. but as of today both tylenol and motrin did not bring my temperature down until after 3 doses.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

accutane is a really great drug for acne and i have found that where nothing else works accutane can actually be life-changing and that it really controls the acne very effectively. but there is a lot of discussion that has to go around it and there is a cost factor as well. one important point is that accutane no longer exists. it is now only in generic form. the generic name is oral isotretinoin. so your doctor may give a prescription for accutane and that's what you will take to the pharmacist but what you get won't be the name accutane it will be the same active drug but under a different name just so you are prepared for that. in terms of cost it can be very costly; however you can shop around. but the generics generally are at a lower cost than the original accutane was to begin with. accutane is one of my -- or accutane in the generic form now is one of my favorite drugs to treat acne. however it's not a cure. oftentimes and it is actually oftentimes after you stop it the acne can recur. often not as bad as it was before you took accutane but you still have to treat the acne over time in most patients. this is usually used with topical products and sometimes even a second course of this oral isotretinoin accutane product if needed. if that acne persists even after that then i look for hormonal imbalances especially in women and i find that when women have the adult pattern of acne which is usually on the lower face and along the jawline even if their periods are regular if i manage it oral contraceptives which you need to be on if you are taking oral isotretinoin anyway but if i manage it with oral contraceptives and even add on some other medicines.

Patient Question:
what cold medicine can i safely give to my 10-year-old child that is taking concerta?

Actual Doctor's Response:
concerta is a prescription medication that is used to treat attention deficit disorder. as a general rule i would try to avoid nonprescription medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine as the active ingredient. taken with concerta these medications would likely increase your child’s heart rate or blood pressure. it is best to choose a cold medicine based on your symptoms. for a sore throat or other pain or fever a pain reliever/fever reducer such as acetaminophen is a good choice. for a runny nose or sneezing an antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine is the right option. pseudoephedrine is a choice to treat nasal or chest congestion. a “dry” or “hacking” cough may be eased by dextromethorphan and a “wet” or “productive” cough might respond to guaifenesin. without knowing your child’s specific symptoms it is hard to choose the right cold medicine for him. but hopefully some of this general information can be helpful. you can always talk to your local pharmacist for a more specific recommendation. and always let your pharmacist know about the medications that your child is taking as it is always important to check for interactions between prescription and nonprescription medications before use.

co-sleeping isn’t recommended because of what we know about sleep safety. there’s more of a risk of smothering sudden infant death syndrome and of falls off the adult bed when there’s bedsharing. . always put your baby on his back to sleep never on his side or tummy. there’s a higher risk of sids if they’re on their tummy or their side; they can roll onto their stomach if they’re lying on their side. and be sure that childcare providers grandparents and so on know to put the baby on his back because there’s also a higher risk of sids if a baby is usually put to sleep on his back but suddenly gets put to sleep on his tummy. finally be sure to give your baby a lot of tummy time when he’s awake. tummy time helps promote physical development; generally babies don’t roll or crawl as soon if they don’t get tummy time for example. and if you’re worried about sids you want them to have a stronger head and neck so they can [lift] their face up if it gets covered.

Patient Question:
what can i do when life feels overwhelming?

Actual Doctor's Response:
because the many aspects of our lives are inter-related problems in one area often create difficulties in others too. for example a husband or wife losing a job generally puts a strain on their marriage. that strain can cause tension creating an emotional rift between them. if one of them has struggled with overeating alcoholism depression or poor anger management those issues are likely to return. and all of this can overflow into problem with children who live within this strained home environment. when this happens to you the most important first step (after realizing how overwhelmed you feel) is to really look at the ‘mountain. ’ what you will see upon closer inspection is that the mountain is not really one big weight. it is more like a pile of rocks. some of those rocks might be really heavy but they are each much more manageable than the mountain that you previously perceived. once you see your problems as a pile of rocks you can begin to sort them; from pebbles to boulders. tossing out the pebbles is relatively easy (is being five minutes late for work because of traffic really worth all that frustration? ). you can also move many of those rocks off of you (if talking to jane at work causes nothing but aggravation you can minimize your interactions with her. ). the result is that the mountain is no longer so big and unmovable. you will also begin to see how to move other rocks that didn’t seem to budge before. so for instance as you begin to lighten your load when your mother makes those critical comments that she so frequently tosses out you will begin to see them as her problem — not one you need to carry. you might still get upset but perhaps less so and you will be able to move past it more quickly.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's can be tough diagnosing an itchy body. hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions. treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source. i had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walk-in medical clinic for professional help. my symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash. i though that i had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications. i also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms. obviously i was not contagious. in my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral ant-biotic that i had already taken for 5 days. since i had previously taken this same anti- biotic in the past without negative consequences and didn't immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime i mistakenly excluded the anti-biotic as my allergic source. in my case i was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed prednisone and directed to terminate the offending ant-biotic. in your case after 3-4 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines it's probably time to see a doctor.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
early treatment for pneumonia is most effective. see a doctor right away if you think you might have pneumonia. exactly which drug is used to treat pneumonia depends on the type of germ and on your doctor's treatment strategy. in most cases treatment must be continued until most symptoms are gone. this is to be sure that all the germs are killed. full recovery may not occur until after the treatment is completed. antibiotics can cure bacterial pneumonia and make recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia much quicker. antiviral drugs can be used to treat certain types of viral pneumonia but there is not yet any treatment that works against all causes. supportive treatment often helps. this can include medicines that ease chest pain and relieve violent coughing. sometimes oxygen is needed. in all cases a proper diet speeds recovery. young healthy people can feel perfectly fine only a week after recovery from pneumonia. a middle-aged person may not regain full strength for several weeks. in all cases plenty of rest is needed. people generally can return to work as soon as they feel up to it but they will need to take it easy at first.

it's a bacterial infection so it can be treated with antibiotics usually erythromycin or similar antibiotics. if antibiotics are recommended it’s important to take all the doses as prescribed. over-the-counter cough medicines are not recommended and don't really help. the prescription medicines that are effective for cough are strong and they're generally avoided in young children and are probably not effective for pertussis. it's commonly recommended to minimize the things that can trigger the cough. with younger kids try to keep them quiet and limit their activity. a humidifier is often used as breathing moist air can soothe the airways. infants with severe disease require hospitalization sometimes in intensive care. it can be serious enough to require intubation and ventilation -- in which a breathing tube is inserted into the throat both to protect the airways and to assist with breathing until they can recover from the infection.

it may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. it may take time but you can get better with treatment. to help yourself: talk to your doctor about treatment options and progress. keep a regular routine such as eating meals at the same time every day and going to sleep at the same time every night. try to get enough sleep. stay on your medication. learn about warning signs signaling a shift into depression or mania. expect your symptoms to improve gradually not immediately.

adjustment. that’s the key word when it comes to jet lag and for good reason. when your internal clock doesn’t match the external clock it can be -– and feel -— like world war iii in your body. the problems that arise with jet lag are a clear example of how external influences can disrupt our internal body clock. so what can you do to prevent the jet lag from making your trip a drag? how about setting your body clock to a new time zone before the journey? by using light therapy or an alarm clock that simulates dawn and dusk with techniques to induce sleep you can reset your circadian body clock before a journey thus preventing jet lag from the very start. if you are planning a trip across more than two time zones and want to get accustomed to your destination’s time zone quickly this might be an approach to take. let’s say you have an important business trip for which you have to fly east. before flying you’d go to bed and wake up earlier each day while using a light box in the morning and winding down earlier in the evening. if you’re traveling west you would expose yourself to bright light later in the day go to bed later and wake up a little later in the morning. if you don’t have the time or inclination to get a light box then consider direct sunlight as the next-best alternative. light boxes while producing artificial light that mimics the sun’s intensity don’t emit ultraviolet radiation. they are designed to produce those perfect wavelengths of light (peaking in the optimal “blue” wavelength range or 460 nanometers) and the light gets directed angularly at your eyes for the greatest effect. if you can shift your body clock naturally prior to departing this can be a particularly useful technique if your trip doesn’t allow for much time to adjust before kicking into high gear and demanding your top performance. try and switch over to your new time zone right away by going to bed and getting up at the same time you would normally but on this new time zone. so if you usually go to bed at 10 p. m. in l. a. do the same the first night you land in new york even though your body might think it’s only 7 p. m. then the next morning try and go for a walk outside exposing yourself to light and movement that can help re-set your internal clock. and take my traveler’s survivor kit with you: * ear plugs. * eye mask. * favorite soothing music and head phones or a device like an ipod. * c-shaped pillow that fits around your neck. these strategies can also be used for shift workers.

Patient Question:
i have some lorazepam from a few years back. how long can medicine be stored?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most medications are good for about a year after you get them from the pharmacy that is if they are stored properly away from direct heat or light and in a cool dry place. i do not recommend keeping medication longer than a year because passing time increases the likelihood that mistakes can be made while taking it. if you haven’t used the lorazapam in years most likely you don't need it. so i would recommend discarding it. the best way to dispose of medication is through a local drug take-back program. or mix the pills with an undesirable substance -- like kitty litter or used coffee grounds -- wrap it all up and throw it away. flushing medications down the toilet is not recommended.

can bacon be part of a healthy diet?

Actual Doctor's Response:
in very small quantities bacon isn't bad for your diet. but it might increase your risk of heart disease stroke and cancer. first 68% of bacon's calories come from fat almost half of which is saturated. each ounce of bacon contributes 30 milligrams of cholesterol. bacon is also a processed meat which is not considered safe to eat according to the american institute for cancer research. (processed meat is usually red meat preserved via smoking curing or salting that contains nitrates a carcinogen. ) regular consumption of processed meats may lead to higher risk for prostate cancer and several other cancers. if you have to eat bacon one ounce should be enough. even with the highest-fat type of bacon one ounce adds up to 140 calories (the same as one cup of low-fat milk or two small slices of whole wheat bread). choose a slightly leaner type such as oscar mayer center cut smokehouse thick sliced and one ounce adds up to 105 calories and 7. 5 grams of fat. don't make bacon a daily indulgence. when you do treat yourself keep the serving size small and include antioxidant-rich fruits or vegetables in the meal whenever possible.

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is one question that will likely generate multiple answers with differing positions. it is also likely that no one answer will satisfy all viewers as being totally accurate. a medical condition is sometimes defined as an injury disease or disorder. based upon that definition pregnancy does not appear to be a "medical condition". but others will argue that pregnancy can result in medical complications injury or other disorders and therefore may sometimes be a medical condition. here is an interesting note. in at least one state undocumented aliens had not been not been as a rule eligible for medicaid benefits. but the delivery of the baby from a undocumented alien was considered a "medical emergency" and qualified for medicaid coverage. it really comes down to our own feelings on the subject. many would suggest that pregnancy is a natural act and not a medical condition; others would steadfastly hold to the belief that all pregnant woman require medical monitoring and delivery treatment and therefore pregnancy is a medical condition.

the head of the penis is supposed to be very sensitive. this is not a bad thing. because the head of your penis is naturally covered with foreskin it has not lost the sensitivity of someone who has had this protective foreskin removed. just keep washing your penis and later in your life you will be glad for this normal sensitivity. i too am uncircumcised this "sheath" protects our sensitive glans (head of penis) from the elements and keeps the area constantly moist which is how your penis is designed to be. i am 19 now i probably realised i was sensitive around 14-16. over years of washing (without soap never use soap just water and a clean hand). soap has small particles which can cause irritation swelling and soreness eventually completely reducing sensitivity so if you want to keep your erection later in life never wash with soap. but as i was saying months of contact and light rubbing (with lubrication) can significantly reduce your sensitivity but retaining the uncircumcised privilege of making sex better than uncircumcised men.

will melatonin supplements work on patients with hypothyroidism?

Actual Doctor's Response:
melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states " it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. " i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin.

obviously without the ability to examine your finger to determine the significance of this "chunk" that you have i can only offer you some general information. most of these avulsion injuries will heal over time. they will scab over and gradually. new skin will form over this area. larger "chunks" may require stitches to close. since i cannot see your injury you will need to make a judgment about seeking hands-on medical care. keep the wound clean to prevent infection. use a topical antibiotic ointment and keep in covered with a bandage until a scab forms.

trinsicon is a multivitamin used to help treat or prevent low levels of iron. it contains iron with b12 vitamin c folic acid and intrinsic factor. generally this medication is well tolerated especially when the directions are followed including taking this medication as directed by your physician. it may be taken with food or a meal if stomach upset occurs. take each dose with a full glass (8 oz or 240 ml) of water unless your doctor directs you otherwise. swallow it whole. do not crush or chew. do not lie down for 30 minutes after taking this medication. it is important not to exceed the recommended dosage. the common side effects for this medication are constipation and stomach upset. this is largely due to the iron component and can be minimized by eating a meal when taking the tablet and by using a stool softener for extended complications with constipation. if all the instructions have been followed and the side effects become more intense you should consult your health care professional. you may also consider working with your pharmacist to find an alternative medication. there are several brand names for this vitamin that you could try to see if you experience lesser side effects. iron is also formulated as a slow-release product.

what cold medication can pregnant women take for sore throat?

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
most cold medicines are pregnancy category b meaning there is no good proof that they are safe and no good proof that they’re not. certain cold medicines such as pseudoephedrine and phenlyephrine are category c meaning that animal studies have shown a risk to the fetus but human studies are lacking. there is a chance of fetal harm if the drug is administered during pregnancy but the potential benefits may outweigh the potential risk. acetaminophen (tylenol) is good at reducing fever and aches and is widely considered safe during pregnancy (although it has not been assigned to a preganancy category by the fda). ibuprofen naproxen and other nsaids are pregnancy category c. heated humidified air is safe and helpful for reducing nasal congestion. colds get better on their own. cold medicines don’t shorten the duration of a cold. and in clinical studies most cold medicines only reduce symptoms slightly. the cold does not pose any additional risk to the baby. all pregnant women should get the influenza vaccine during flu season which is safe for both mother and baby. catching the flu during pregnancy can be serious. many obstetricians are comfortable recommending common cold medicines that are probably safe during pregnancy. if you’re too miserable to make it through your cold symptoms call your doctor and ask what he or she recommends.

Actual Doctor's Response:
just pick him up. he may need a bit of extra affection that he is not getting in day-care. when you are holding him he feels that you will not go away. after a few minutes just put him down and play with him as a distraction. this will eventually stop. you don't see parents carrying older kids around in most cases.

leave it alone. there are natural adhesions attaching the head of the penis to the foreskin at this age. forcibly retracting the foreskin can be very painful so just clean what you can see. it may be red because you are causing very tiny micro-tears in his foreskin. some children do have very tight foreskins so please allow the pediatrician to make that determination during an examination. most of the men/boys in the world are uncircumcised just the way nature made them. as he ages those natural adhesions will resolve and his foreskin will completely retract. if not there are prescription steroid creams that can be used to help it along. in my pediatric practice i rarely intervene medically until age 7 or 8 (unless the foreskin is super-tight and it "balloons" when he urinates). if this is the case a pediatric urologist should be consulted.

this is a common question i get at the pharmacy. the first thing i ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications. if your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice. if you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs. many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting merck and astrazeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on.

Patient Question:
how is anemia caused by decreased red blood cell production treated?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production. with iron deficiency anemia your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron which your body can absorb easily. timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. if you use iron supplements remember the following cautions: * always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. excess iron intake can be harmful. symptoms of iron overload include fatigue vomiting diarrhea headache irritability heart disease and joint problems. * iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children. iron poisoning is the most common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. eating even a few tablets can prove fatal in a matter of hours. symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness confusion nausea vomiting and diarrhea. seek medical help immediately. * watch for side effects. you may need to continue taking iron supplements for up to one year. taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects which may include nausea diarrhea constipation and stomach pain. let your doctor know if you continue to have side effects. different formulations are available. * watch for drug interactions. tell your doctor if you are being treated for another condition. for example calcium supplements interfere with iron absorption so it is best to take them at different times of the day. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. good dietary sources of iron include red meat beans egg yolk whole-grain products nuts and seafood. many processed foods and milk are also reinforced with iron. your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts including hematocrit hemoglobin and ferritin levels during treatment. if your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. in rare cases your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). in extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia treatment may involve a blood transfusion

for anemia caused by problems of the bone marrow and stem cells anemia tends to be more persistent and difficult to treat. the treatments for hereditary anemias such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease vary widely and depend on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. some anemias will not require any treatment while others may require repeated transfusions and other aggressive measures. although aplastic anemia will occasionally go into spontaneous remission people with this disorder generally require bone marrow transplantation.

Actual Doctor's Response:
two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!

Patient Question:
can osteoarthritis in back cause pain in my lft gluteal muscle into hip joint down frnt thigh and not be able to walk? . i frequently have the pain in my gluteal muscle and the pain in my hip joint. after too much house work or shopping the pain gets really bad in my hip into the side and front of my thigh. it has gotten severe enough that i can not lift my leg to walk. after sitting a while i can walk again but it comes back. ice relives the pain and after about a week of using ice sometimes over-night pain in my thigh leaves. can arthritis cause these issues?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i had the same type of pain. my doctor said the femoral nerve was being compressed in my back and sent me for therapy. i was very doubtful about this but after a few weeks of therapy the pain disappeared. the main exercise was: stand a few inches from a wall place hands flat on the wall at chest level. press the lower body forward a few inches repeat 30 times 2 or 3 times a day. don't over-extend just press forward as long as it is comfortable.

what is implantable contraception?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a single rod containing progestin that is implanted by your doctor under the skin. it is effective for up to 3 years and can be removed earlier. you can find more information from the american society for reproductive medicine on this topic here: <link> it's a form of birth control that should protects against pregnancy for up to 3 years. the implant which looks like a rod is about the size of a matchstick and is implanted under the skin by your doctor. it's easily removable by your doctor when you want to plan a pregnancy and fertilty returns to normal without any delay. like all forms of contraception there are side effects that you should consider such as weight gain irregular bleeding acne mood changes and headache. this method is considered nearly 100% effective with less than one pregnancy occurring for every one hundred women using an implant for a year. it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. however you can reduce your risk by using a latex condom every time you have vaginal oral or anal sex.

it is possible to receive social security disability (ssdi) or supplemental security benefits (ssi) based upon your medical and emotional conditions. do not listen to those well-meaning people who may say that your diagnoses will not qualify you for disability. you do not have to have a terminal disease to become eligible for disability. the waiting process for approval can range from 6 months to several years so you must be ready to live without a regular pay check for some time. you must also be incapable of doing any gainful work. if you feel that you cannot continue to work it is recommended to start the application process immediately. if approved your original application date will be used to establish the approval date and possible retroactive benefits. you may also think about contacting an attorney specializing in helping folks to obtain disability benefits. the application process can be cumbersome and becomes a living legal document which will be used to assess your eligibility. attempting to correct mistakes or supply missing documentation later is not recommended. treat the application responsibility and do it right the first time. if it seems like too much work then it is best to forget applying. the application should be initiated as correctly and completely as possible the first time. you should begin to start a daily diary detailing your activities of daily living and your medical and emotional symptoms experienced. you should also gather all of your medical records from each medical professional that has provided you with medical care. attempt to secure the backing of your primary care doctor as well as other medical specialists to support your disability claim. they may be able to provide you with a letter attesting to your being completely disabled. also seek a letter from your employer stating their observance of you being unable to complete your job responsibilities due to your disabilities. letters from other people testifying that they are aware of your physical and emotional decline may also be useful. the majority of people are denied at the first step of the approval process. but with a legitimate disability being adequately documented and by following the above guidelines eventual disability approval is possible with your clinical conditions.

in the united states approximately 200 000 people contract hbv [hepatitis b virus] each year. however only 10 000 to 15 000 of these people develop a chronic hepatitis b infection. why do some people clear the virus from their bodies while others progress to chronic disease? it appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection. the immune system is relatively immature early in life. therefore the younger a person is when hbv is contracted the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease. if an adult is infected her probability of developing chronic disease is very low—approximately 1 to 5 percent. if a person contracts the infection in infancy there is as much as a 90- to 95-percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body. children fall somewhere in between having approximately a 25 to 35 percent chance of going on to chronic disease. men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of hbv. the reason for this has not been determined. also people with poor immune systems—such as those infected with hiv organ recipients and those undergoing chemotherapy—have a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies. patients who are the sickest during their acute illness especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis have the highest likelihood of totally recovering and thus not progressing to a chronic disease.

what is the best over the counter diet pill for weight loss and energy

Actual Doctor's Response:
my gut response to this is: none of them. diet pills are not the answer for long-term weight loss and energy. the best way to lose weight and increase energy is simple. eat a healthy balanced diet and exercise regularly (at least three times a week). if you do just these two things and do them consistently you'll lose weight keep it off and probably see your energy level rise considerably. check out webmd's diet community for plenty of tips of on how safely lose weight and keep it off for good! all the best to you! although some diet pills may work to promote weight loss and boost energy are the side effects really worth it? take alli for example the first fda approved over-the-counter weight loss pill. some of the side effects of alli include oily or fatty stools and difficulty controlling bowel movements that can cause leakage into undergarments. also although rare a more serious problem is possible liver damage. keep in mind that alli is actually approved by the fda undergoing a very extensive process while many other pills or supplements have no additional research to verify their claims or identify risks. the answer is simple: diet pills can’t replace healthy lifestyle behavior changes like implementing an exercise routine or eating whole food to promote weight loss. my husband and i started to use myfitnesspal. com 3 weeks ago and i have lost 3 pounds already. we are not going hungry just counting our calories and cutting our portions as we have always been big portion eaters. we are also walking from 45 min to 60 min at least 3 times a week which gives you more calories. we usually don't use them though because the calories for women are 1200 and men are 1500. this system is a very good way to learn to eat better. log in and check it out. you will be surprised and happy with what you find. taking diet pills will only curb your appetite they will not help you stay healthy. they can also lead to an addiction. you do need to do some form of exercise like walking or biking. i am not familiar so much familiar with over the counter weight loss pills but i suggest that you speak with dr. eric schweiger an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at mount sinai medical center. he can help you with your weight loss plans. <link>

Patient Question:
how long does it take for food to pass through the stomach and small intestine to the large intestine?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the transit time is quite variable in all people. there are no set times. food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hours. or days. in babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid. babies often poop while you are feeding them! in some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation. transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volume/size of meal the amount of water/fluids and the amount of fiber/solids. spicy food may be faster than you anticipated. a heavy thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more. this is a very interesting question. there are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. to start the type of food matters. some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. on the other hand other foods won’t have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly. fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else. the answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender. you have to consider that people’s digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways. did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people? certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest. also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too. how long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors. dosent it only takes 30 mins?

doctors make a diagnosis of oa based on a physical exam and history of symptoms. the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based on a combination of the following factors: * a description of symptoms. * the location and pattern of pain. * certain findings in a physical examination. x-rays may be used to confirm a diagnosis and to make sure that no other type of arthritis is present. most people over age 60 reflect the disease on x-ray; about a third of patients have actual symptoms. sometimes blood tests are administered. while blood tests cannot point to anything in particular that can help a doctor confirm the presence of oa the tests can help the doctor determine the presence of a different type of arthritis. if fluid has accumulated in the body's joints the doctor may remove some of the fluid with a process called joint aspiration and may examine the fluid under a microscope to rule out other diseases.

how is c. difficile passed from person to person

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a very good question. clostridium difficile (or c. diff) is a highly contagious bacterium that is spread by direct contact. it's important to note that antiseptic hand cleaners are not effective against c. diff. good hand hygiene is extremely important in avoiding the spread of c. diff. if you are providing care for someone with c. diff you should consider wearing protective paper gowns and discarding them after each patient contact. try not to come in contact with any of the patient's feces (though c. diff gets spread onto pretty much all the surfaces a c. diff patient comes in contact with). wash your hands after every contact with a c. diff patient. to wash properly first turn on the water tap and wet your hands. then add soap and work into a vigorous lather. rinse the soap off thoroughly. dry thoroughly. (the drying part is very important because it helps ensure the bacteria don't linger in the wonderful moist skin environment. ) if you maintain good hand hygiene you can help avoid spreading this awful bacteria. hope this helps!

in medical terms the suffix “-otomy” means to cut or separate. in a tracheotomy a surgeon cuts a small hole in the front of the trachea (windpipe). tracheotomy is most often performed on people who require weeks of mechanical ventilation (dependence on a breathing machine). tracheotomy is also performed in emergencies for choking; for people with neck cancer; as an extreme treatment for obstructive sleep apnea; and for other less common conditions. after the surgeon cuts through the skin and trachea she inserts a plastic tube into the hole. this tube is called a tracheostomy tube (“-ostomy” means an artificially created passage out of the body). oftentimes the surgery and the tube itself are referred together simply as a tracheostomy.

currently there are no drug-drug interactions between alcoholic beverages and prednisone. however new drug interactions may be discovered. so it is important to check with your health care professional especially the pharmacist to make sure it is still ok to take this combination together. prednisone and alcohol even when ingested separately can have the potential to cause irritation to the gastrointestinal system leading to an increased risk for stomach ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. know more here <link>

yes it is safe to take ibuprofen after having an alcoholic beverage. it might be best to take the ibuprofen with food to prevent stomach upset. alcohol can irritate the stomach as can ibuprofen so taking both together might just add to the effect. as i said a little bit of food or a snack should help.

Patient Question:
hypothyroidism. i just had my blood works done and my doctor saw that my calcium levels are slightly above my normal range. my potassium has been low for quite some time now as well. for the past 5 to 6 years i have been feeling tired intermittently. i don't sleep well and when i wake up (even with 8 hours of sleep) i don't feel rested. also i've noticed that i've been having low-grade fever. i seem to be more sensitive to cold weather. i noticed also that i can feel some hot areas on my skin.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. the most common cause of thyroid gland failure is called autoimmune thyroiditis a form of thyroid inflammation caused by the patient's own immune system.

Model's Recommendation:

it does sound to me that you very well may be suffering from hypothyroidism or at least a sluggish thyroid but it cannot be known for sure without more test results. what tests did your doctor run exactly? if he suspects it may by a thyroid issue he definitely should have ran a tsh free t3 and free t4 test at very least as well as some other tests that may will greatly improve the chances of diagnosing this correctly. without them it is hard to say because hypothyroidism can have overlapping symptoms with other disorders many of which can also be discovered through a comprehensive hormone test. i strongly recommend you getting one done if your doctor has not already.

a pulled hamstring (hamstring strain) is one of the most common exercise-related injuries. a hamstring strain occurs when a movement stretches the muscles running along the back of the thigh tearing some of the muscle fibers. any activity that involves running or jumping can cause a hamstring strain. time and rest are the best treatment for most hamstring strains. other treatments may help reduce swelling and speed recovery: apply ice to the area for 30 minutes every few hours for two to three days. wrap the hamstring with an elastic bandage. elevate the leg on a pillow when sitting or lying down. over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen (advil motrin nuprin) or naproxen (aleve) can relieve pain and swelling as well. unless you’re sure it’s ok it’s best to check with your doctor before taking these medicines.

we have seen a dr for my baby's very severe diaper rash and are using rx cream but nothing seems to work. she has had the rash for about 2 weeks in different states throughout. it has been the "1 step forward 2 steps" back sort of thing. she has open sores that have gotten to a point where they have shrunk but refuse to heal any more. she has also been on oral antibiotics for 3 days now. today the actual 'rash' part of it that we thought had finally gone away has resurfaced with a vengence. . please help with any suggestions.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i experienced something similar with my baby girl and the only thing that worked was this over the counter stuff called domeboro. it came in little packets that you just mix with water and soak their tush in. it was the only thing that would work and it helped immediately! i think you may be able to find it at walgreens.

shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients. swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities (especially the ankles) and by weight gain. i have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day. one individual in particular stands out in my mind. she was much younger than 85 years old and took lasix (diuretic) every day to release excess fluid. when swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred metolazone (known as the turbo pill) was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control. although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician. being 85 years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation. despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the e. r. may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry. i suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment. best wishes for this lady's speedy recovery.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you get a policy through the marketplace you can still deduct the cost of insurance from your taxes. if you qualify for a subsidy that lowers your insurance costs the amount would be offset by the amount of the subsidy you receive. regarding the changing policies many existing insurance plans don't meet the requirements of the law. in that case you would be required to switch policies. and you would be best served to shop all of your options and not just move to the plan bcbs pushes you toward.

what are the symptoms of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
in a person with a healthy immune system when first infected with toxoplasmosis most people don't get sick. a few people have mild flu -like symptoms which can last as long as several months. this is why people rarely know whether or when they have had toxoplasmosis. symptoms can include: swollen glands. muscle aches. fatigue. fever. sore throat. skin rash. in a newborn most infected newborns have no symptoms at birth. but without treatment some can develop eye or brain damage that ranges from mild to severe. blindness can develop up to 20 years after birth but this is rare. some infected newborns have severe symptoms at birth including: eye pain vision problems or blindness. brain damage leading to intellectual disability and occasionally seizures. in a person with a weak immune system a person who has a very weak immune system (weakened by hiv infection organ transplant medicines or lymphoma ) can develop life-threatening toxoplasmosis. antibiotic therapy is often used to prevent this from happening. severe infection requires aggressive treatment. in very rare cases otherwise healthy people who get toxoplasmosis can have severe symptoms related to the brain eyes lungs or heart. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider. any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area it's a good idea to get examined. you can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your utis. because your uti cleared up over a month ago i wouldn't think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics. and i don't think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if you're spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves. at any rate i'd recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam. best wishes to you!

every time i do rounds in the cardiac surgery recovery unit i am amazed. room after room of people who just a few hours previously had their ribs split their heart exposed to the circulating air of the operating room and a human being’s hands replacing a heart valve or sewing healthy grafts on diseased coronary arteries. and there they lay with tubes drips and ventilators monitoring their every movement and supporting every breath. even the ones who are awake are groggy and it’s not surprising when they fall asleep while i’m talking or drift off in the middle of a sentence. this is heart surgery after all. it’s the medical equivalent of being hit by a truck. it’s a hard thing to grasp when you are signing a consent form but sometimes being hit by a truck is worth it. every day thousands of people’s hearts see more blood flow and oxygen from new blood vessels and valve replacement -- or repair -- fixes drafts and leaks and enables blood to travel where it needs to without being blocked by an obstruction. while we are able to do a lot of things these days without surgery the or still plays a very important role in extending life and improving its quality. one of the greatest concerns people have is post-operative recovery. while it is easier to quantify and estimate the risks related to surgery (or any invasive procedure for that matter) it’s the time afterward that can be more difficult to predict. for a day or two after surgery most people experience significant fatigue but typically this period is self-limited and once the body really starts to heal the progression is miraculous. patients stroll around the wards days after surgery with chest tubes catheters and invasive monitors just a memory from the intensive care unit. we typically discharge cardiac surgery patients on post-operative day five – it’s a testament to just how resilient the human body can be. but in all fairness the real recovery then begins at home. we recommend that patients try to walk for twenty or thirty minutes each day to help regain strength as well as improve lung function after surgery. it’s not uncommon for people to feel fatigue for several weeks or even a month or two after surgery. we arrange for a follow-up visit with our cardiologists as well as the heart surgeon to touch base a few weeks after surgery examine the incision site to make sure that everything is healing well and to adjust any medications if necessary. if you are going to have heart surgery you definitely have questions – here are a few to help frame the discussion with your surgeon and cardiologist: * how many of these types of procedures have you done? * how would you estimate my risk of a complication as compared to other patients? * what type of valve replacement or repair do you recommend and why? * where do you plan to obtain grafts (legs arms chest wall) for my bypass operation? * how soon can i travel after my surgery? * when do you anticipate that i can go back to work after surgery? * do you recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program or physical therapy to help speed up my recovery? it’s a long road and not without its frustrations and challenges along the way. but it takes people where they want to be – and where they need to be in many cases. the surgeon and cardiologist are only part of the process – in my opinion the majority of the healing lies within the patients themselves.

Actual Doctor's Response:
1. depression may be inherited from family members. the more family you have that are depressed the more likely you will be. perhaps genetics is to blame for about 30% of depression where stress family upbringing trauma and personality style is the other 70%. 2. you may inherit genes for depression. you can also inherit the ability to respond to certain medicines that other family members respond too. so if your dad responded well to prozac your chances are good too as you likely have the same type of 'genetic' depression which was reversed by prozac in your dad. doctors should ask you if you have had a family history of depression and what meds your family took and their response to it.

there’s no good evidence to back up this commonly held belief. the few studies that have tried to link the amount of caffeine consumption and height in kids did not show any connection between caffeine drinking and being short. most caffeinated drinks children drink are sodas and energy drinks filled with sugar as well as caffeine. sugary beverages don’t stunt growth they enhance weight gain. probably for this reason high intake of soft drinks may be also a risk factor for developing diabetes. reserving coffee and tea for grownups may not have scientific proof behind it but there’s nothing wrong with it either. sugary caffeinated drinks are best as a rare treat for adults and children.

what is the strongest over-the-counter headache/pain reliever medicine?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is no stronger over-the-counter medication for headache or migraine pain relief. headaches are very individualized. there are several over-the-counter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches. these medications include acetaminophen (tylenol) an effective over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) medication. this medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever. however it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties. this is important for some types of headache relief. in addition the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug class (nsaids) consists of products like ibuprofen (motrin advil) and naproxen (naprosyn aleve) which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. lastly combination products such as excedrin migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. these ingredients combined make a more powerful headache/pain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone. it is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity. monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication. if you're 18 or older advil migrane and excedrin migrane are really good. i don't know about all around pain relievers. advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fast-acting it also lasts all day. excedrin migrane is supposedly the safest and #1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine. also if you're not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please don't take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason.

if your patient wanted to go off meds and had no major episodes of manic depression for a while what would you advise?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it would depend on the patient. if they had a history of multiple significant manic or depressive episodes i would counsel them that their decision was very risky and probably ill-advised and warn them of the likelihood of relapse and clarify what their wishes would be should they relapse. in my experience in people with bipolar i disorder an eventual relapse off medicines is almost always inevitable and i don't know that there is any "natural" way to avoid that. i would encourage regular ongoing monitoring/visits and enlist their family as look-outs on the team. if they had a history of suicide attempts or hospitalization or psychosis in the last few years i would probably urge them against a very dangerous idea and personally not feel comfortable being cast as simply an onlooker to looming disaster. in someone who had a history of episodes long ago who's been stable for at least several years no suicide attempts functioning well they're responsible family is supportive no drugs or alcohol relationships and work are stable/steady and they know what to watch for and could catch a looming relapse quickly so we could nip it in the bud and were agreeable to resuming medicines at the first signs of relapse i would probably be much more encouraging.

why does my nose run all the time? . its not all the time but it feels like its always running. i have noticed that im always sniffling or blowing my nosse.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sorry to hear of this. dealing with a constantly runny nose can be very annoying! the medical term for a runny nose is rhinitis. the runnyness is caused by inflammation of the nasal tissue. the most common type of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis. however it's possible to have the non-allergic variety too. another flavor of rhinitis is called gustatory rhinitis and this refers to getting a runny nose when you eat. other things can cause a runny nose such as exposure to cold weather. if you've never been diagnosed with nasal allergies this would be a good time to see your health care provider to determine if your runny nose is caused by allergies or not. if it is an over-the-counter or prescription medication may help dry up your nasal tissue. if your runny nose is not caused by allergies then your only option may be to invest in a lot of tissue. not the best news i know. hope this helps!

is your heart pounding for hours a sign of anxiety attacks?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it can but i never say it's anxiety until after there's been a full medical exam to rule out anything physical. you should consider doing this and also take a look to see if you might be experiencing undue stress lack of sleep or anything else that might have triggered this.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should never stop taking insulin unless specifically advised to do so by the medical provider who is treating your diabetes. and you should definitely not start eating sugar! if your blood sugar is normal perhaps it is because you are on the proper dose of insulin and you are now eating more appropriately. please call your doctor before thinking of making any changes in your medical regime.

it depends on which products you are using. over-the-counter (otc) products have directions on the label with age-specific dosage instructions as well as uses warnings and possible side effects and storage information. decongestant ointments and sprays can cause rebound nasal congestion if used for an extended period of time. if you ever have questions about over-the-counter medications be sure to ask your pharmacist.

Actual Doctor's Response:
schisandra has the potential to interact with many different medications -- either increasing or decreasing the medication's effects in the body. be very careful taking this with your medications and don't take it without first checking with your doctor. as with many supplements we don't have enough information to know what effects it may have particularly in someone on medications like humira and methotrexate. medscape. com (its a site for physicians) has a free drug interaction checker that is really helpful. here's a link: <link> i hope this helps.

i strongly urge you to contact your doctor as soon as possible. by going off plavix you have put yourself at a much greater risk of experiencing a life-threatening blood clot. no one should discontinue a prescription 'blood thinner' without consulting their doctor first. you don't say why you were prescribed plavix (clopidogrel) but it's often given to people after they've had a heart attack recent stroke angioplasty procedure or if they have peripheral vascular disease. these conditions put a person at an increased risk of developing a blood clot that travels to the lungs or possibly the brain causing problems breathing or a stroke. to answer your question omega-3 oils are thought to have 'blood-thinning' properties but they are in no way a substitute for a prescription anticoagulant like clopidogrel. in fact a 2002 study showed they had no effect on coagulation or platelet function after surgery. clopidogrel works by making your platelets (a type of red blood cell that enables blood to clot) more slippery so they don't stick together easily. this effect reduces the chances of blood clotting and traveling to the lungs or brain. again i urge you to contact your doctor and discuss this issue with him or her. at three months without plavix you could very well have a blood clot brewing. your healthcare provider will want to examine you and perhaps run some tests to make sure you're safe. there are many other types of anticoagulants available for your use besides clopidogrel if that product causes side effects. wishing you well!

i am so sorry that you went on web md for advice about your dog. hopefully you took your dog to the vet in time. yes dogs can get congestive heart failure. weight gain is a sign more in the chest area as you had said your dog was gaining. there is no reason a dog would gain like that on the same amount of food or cutting back on the food except if you went from given exercise to zero exercise. the only other reason is medical. the weight gain is from fluid retention most likely. they could also be suffering from another issue. that is how it happened in my dog she looked very heavy in the chest. the most common cause for it is advanced cancer. with my dog she lost weight even still her chest looked larger. the tumor was in her throat and she had trouble keeping food down. unfortunately just like in people the most you can do is make them comfortable drugs that help expel the fluids and as long as your dog is happy and pain free love them as much as you can until it is time to put them down. you should never let your dog suffer and trust me you will know when it is time. i truly am sorry you were given such a extremely uneducated answer but it is web md and not vet md. they possibly thought that it was the correct answer not sure how possibly they never owned a dog before.

psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the caucasian population in the united states. it features patchy raised red areas of skin inflammation with scaling. psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees the scalp the navel and around the genital areas or anus. approximately 10% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis. the onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. males and females are affected equally. the skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. in fact the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of patients. however the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. in some patients the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. in fact some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! conversely patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin such as in the eyes heart lungs and kidneys. psoriatic arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis reactive arthritis (formerly known as reiter's syndrome) and arthritis associated with crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. all of these conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints and the eyes skin mouth and various organs. in view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine these conditions are collectively referred to as "spondyloarthropathies.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on cipro or for months after. any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns. since i do not know you full medical history it is best to get patient-specific exercise parameters from your doctor -- someone who does have this information.

if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park farther away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. whichever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals: write down what activity you plan to do on what day of the week for how long and at what time of day. be as specific and realistic as possible. for instance write down "tuesday: walk for 20 minutes at 7 p. m. to the park and back. " at the end of each week review your goals and set new ones for the upcoming week. research shows that setting goals will help you stick to your program. it will clarify what you're supposed to do and let you track your progress. if you hit a roadblock later on you can refer back to what has worked in the past or use your accomplishments to re-energize yourself. first make sure that your doctor clears you for exercise before beginning. he or she may ask you to fill out the physical activity readiness questionnaire (par-q) to ensure that there is no reason for you not to exercise. i would then recommend setting personal goals using the s. m. a. r. t. acronym which stands for: s – specific m – measureable a – attainable r – realistic t – time-oriented here’s a sample goal keeping these principles in mind: “between january 1st and february 1st walk three days per week for twenty minutes per session to aid in weight loss. ” set up short term goals to help you meet your long term goals (6 months or more). think about what you want to achieve by beginning an exercise routine. do you want to lose weight lower your blood pressure or help manage diabetes? do you want to run a race such as a 5k? what do you hope to gain from starting exercise? the biggest problem that people have is that they overwhelm themselves by doing too much exercise too soon. it can be hard to sustain a drastic change like that long term. instead slowly and gradually progress with exercise to make for an easier transition and to allow your body to comfortably adjust. start out doing low impact exercise like walking or riding a bike then gradually increase the time intensity level or number of days per week that you exercise. if you’re new to strength training get help from a personal trainer to make sure that you are using the equipment properly. make a plan and stick to it.

i'm not sure why you are taking all those supplements but let's go down the list. i don't know of any evidence that shows that taking large amounts of b vitamins is beneficial or particularly harmful. if you don't eat fish twice a week taking fish oil high in omega 3 fatty acids dha and epa can help but americans get more than enough omega 6 fatty acids so i'm not sure why this would be needed in a supplement. there seems to be some research that qunol (coenzyme10) can help people who take cholesterol lowering medications who have lower levels in the body but not sure how it helps the general population. i'm not familiar with ubuiquinol but like any supplement check to see if there is any research to show its safety and effectiveness. supplements are not regulated by the fda so safety has to be demonstrated by the company. according to a recent study in pediatrics teenagers fall short on various nutrients including magnesium phosphorus and vitamins a c and e. so if you feel your diet is lacking include a multivitamin that provides 100% daily value for the majority of vitamins and minerals. many people (of all ages) need to supplement with vitamin d because they get little sunshine and foods are generally low in this vitamin. recommendations for calcium at your age are 1300mg because this is a peak time for bone growth. one cup of milk 1. 5 ounce cheese and 6-8 ounce yogurt contains about 300mg calcium so if you are falling short you may want to consider supplementation. no supplement can make up for a diet poor in nutrition. i always recommend a food first strategy but sometimes supplementation is needed to fill nutrition gaps. and most importantly make sure supplements have the research behind them to show they are safe and effective. always check with your healthcare provider about supplements you take.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer bronchitis is just a complication of the cold. bronchitis itself is not contagious but you still should exercise caution when you cough use tissues etc. and wash your hands. you can return to work when you feel better and are fever-free since the cough can last a while.

what pills can reduce stomach fat and consistant bloating. a vegetarian and gluten free but still retain stomach fat and bloating i exercise regularly and drink plenty of water. looking for help.

Actual Doctor's Response:
part of your bloating could be caused by your protein sources. beans and other legumes can cause that so can broccoli soy plenty of vegetables. they can be good for you but you might need some probiotic help or maybe some digestive enzymes. stomach fat won't leave just because you are vegetarian. you still have to exercise regularly (like you are doing) get enough protein to be healthy limit your sugars and starches and take in fewer calories than you burn. you might want to try a different form of exercise to help kick start your fat loss too. if you increase the intensity in what you already do interval fashion you might shock your body a bit and get it working harder. bodies are famous for getting used to an exercise and burning less calories while doing it.

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is not something i've heard before and is not a typical diet recommendation. a variety of fruits and veggies are encouraged to help prevent macular degeneration especially leafy greens like spinach due to their high lutein content. at your next visit i suggest asking your eye doctors why they recommend no carrots so you can better understand the reasoning behind it. good luck!

if you are concerned that you have anemia the only way that you can determine this is to have a blood test for hemoglobin. you will need to have your doctor order this test unless you can find a lab to order one on yourself. if you are anemic your treatment options would depend on the extent of the anemia and type of anemia. not all cases of anemia are related to blood loss or iron-deficiency in the diet. some can be self-treated by nutritional changes while others cannot. as a vegetarian it is your responsibility to make sure you are getting sufficient nutrients including protein and iron-containing foods(occasionally deficient in some vegetarian diets).

your husband's surgery may have nothing to do with his tinnitus or high blood pressure. it may have just happened as they often do was we age. rather than search for a reason or blame see an ent to evaluate the tinnitus (the cause and cure can be very difficult to find) and his primary care doctor to treat the high blood pressure (which incidentally can be one of the hundreds of causes of tinnitus). there are sooooo many different medical issues that may be involved it would be impossible to track them down over the internet.

most helpful answer if your husband has known kidney stones and suddenly gets brown urine tis is most likely due to blood (older hydrolyzed blood; not the bright red blood seen in a fresh bleed). this could indicate the movement of a stone into the bladder or anywhere in the urinary tract including the kidney. stones cause inflammation and inflammation can result in bleeding. he needs to see his urologist again or at least have the urologist order a urinalysis. other causes of dark brown tea-like urine would be hepatitis but because of his stone history this would be highest on the list. so sorry to hear about the kidney stones and now this weird new symptom. it's always disconcerting when our body fluids change color! your husband should see his doctor as soon as possible. dark brown urine can be a sign of liver malfunction which could be caused by several things including medications. before you head for the doctor's office take note of the color and quality (firm loose etc. ) of your husband's stools. this information will help your doctor more quickly rule out possible causes for the brown urine. meanwhile your husband probaby should avoid consuming alcohol or acetaminophen (tylenol) just in case he's having an issue with his liver. if he has been prescribed a narcotic pain reliever such as oxycodone-apap he should weigh whether or not he can get along without it since "apap" is shorthand for acetaminophen. if you have any questions about whether any of his prescriptions contain acetaminophen you can speak to a pharmacist for clarification. i wish you all the best!

Actual Doctor's Response:
that depends on the type of herpes virus you have. after being infected people with herpes simplex virus-1 (hsv-1) tend to have far fewer and less severe outbreaks than those infected with herpes simplex virus-2 (hsv-2). both types can cause genital herpes. many people never have symptoms and don't even know they are infected. in those who do have symptoms of genital herpes how often they will appear and how long they will last varies greatly from person to person. stress illness menstruation and various other things can trigger a flare-up.

whether or not your partner has infected you with genital herpes depends on whether you have always practiced safe sex for one thing. also it may depend on how long you've been sexually intimate with each other. if you've had sex only once or twice and if you used a condom each time your risk of getting genital herpes is lower than if you've had unprotected sex for a long time. but you could have been infected during any one encounter. don't think you're in the clear because you've never seen herpes sores on your partner's genitals or your own. the symptoms of genital herpes are often subtle and easily mistaken for something else like bug bites pimples razor burn or hemorrhoids. what's more the virus can be contagious even when there are no symptoms.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry you experience this. it doesn't sound pleasant that's for sure! whenever a patient describes pain with words like "jolt of electricity " we tend to think in terms of nerve pain. only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like x-rays or mri can say for sure what's going on with your neck. that said i would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly. this type of neck pain can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae (spinal bones) of your neck. while i don't think this situation is an emergency i would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon. catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome. you can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling. hope this helps! i do that all the time. even in bed. go see a chiropractor! i wouldn't want to live without one since i started seeing one. usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes. also ice packs to the area help with the pain. this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine i am a yoga guru in india. been in the field for 12 yrs. i also have been suffering from arthritis for some time in the neck hands and low back. believe me i am not taking any medicine. i have been able to manage only with yogaanasas yoga nidra or corpe pose. you have to learn from an expert and not self learn. it is a good pain reliever. my website is srimadhwayoga. com yoga guru i have had this exact pain since i was a little girl (5 or 6). im now 18. i used to go to doctors all the time and no one ever knew what to do. it hasnt happened for about 3 years but it is now happening monthly. did you have any luck finding out what is causing this pain?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that "comes and goes. " usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were "fine" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is -- if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i can't really offer you a patient-specific answer over the internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue. you do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weight-control specialist (baritrician). you are eating more than you body needs. this is the only way (other than water retention) that a mammal (you) can put on large amounts of weight. we do not pull calories from the air. while it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only 500 calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale; a 1000 calorie a day increase could at two pounds a week. the first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary. write down everything you eat including the amounts/weight and their determine their caloric content. your doctor will likely need this information. it is important that you burn the calories that you take in. this may be something that you fail to do. you may speak with dr. schweiger a board certified dermatologist who can help you with an effective way to reduce unwanted body fats.

wow sounds like your really working hard! however one thing that's probably tripping you up is your diet. 1200 calories is really low. i know its hard to believe but you need to eat more and insure your eating the right things. i highly recommend webmd's food and fitness planner. this is a great site that can provide you with a ton of good info. the best part of the site is the food log that enables you to accurately track what types of food your eating and how much. with all the work your putting in you should be seeing some results so shake it up a bit. this week log on the the food and fitness planner and learn more about the food and calories you need. next week try something a little different in your fitness program. maybe work in some interval training or change your weight lifting program since you've plateaued its time to make some changes however start slow so you can tell what's working. click on the link below and take a look at dr peeke's article for some additional info as well. the 5 rules of weight removal by pamela peeke md it's time to re-think your plan. very low calorie diets while they make sense in the long run aren't successful as your body starts to hold on to fat as it thinks your starving. first sign up for webmd's food and fitness planner and use the calorie calculator to adjust your daily calorie intake. (see link below) <link> next start using the food and exercise log to track your progress. once you've done that i would suggest modifying your workouts. for example begin interval training 1 to 2 times a week and change up your strength training program. also with your weights don't be afraid to lift heavy as adding muscle is a great way to increase your metabolism. there are several great articles on both these topics here at webmd that you can access by entering them into the search bar. good luck! hi you could try doing a couple of days a week on 500 cals or try a mars bar sometimes you body needs a kick start a mars bar would or could do that. or try changing the diet plan your on. could be that your body is now happy could you be a woman if yes that happens its called contentment. do hope this helps. good luck

Patient Question:
i am a 30 year old male and have to urinate ~20 times/day. it is especially bad as i go to bed and right as i wake up. i do not wake up in the middle of the night to pee but when i'm lying down to sleep i feel an almost constant need to pee even immediately after doing so. this has been going on for a long while likely over a year. i am otherwise completely healthy. and am not taking any medication. some nights are worse than others but most involve getting up to pee at least 3 times from when i lie down to sleep until when i actually fall asleep. the worst nights i may have to pee up to 10 times.

Actual Doctor's Response:
frequency of urination needs a medical investigation including an examination and blood/urine tests to rule out diabetes mellitus. see your primary care care provider first. if your tests are normal then you will need to see a urologist. this problem can be fixed but a cause will need to be medically-determined first.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sounds plausible to me. after all a number of nerves run up the back of the heel. if you drive frequently and compress those nerves they could give you pain. you might consider wearing a shoe with more cushioning to avoid this problem. some people favor driving moccasins. whatever helps to get the pressure off those nerves. hope you feel better!

well that's no fun! you figure to fix pain with surgery not create more right? it's entirely possible your gait changed after you had back surgery. gait refers to the way you walk: how your weight is distributed on your legs/feet the length of your stride and so on. a change in your gait could certainly contribute to the symptoms you describe. the most common cause of heel pain is a condition called plantar fasciitis (pronounced "planter" "fah-she-eye-tiss"). plantar fasciitis is an annoyance but not a serious disease. your health care provider can tell you whether or not you have plantar fasciitis or some other problem with your foot. he or she also should be able to tell you if this is related to your back surgery. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to start with. good luck to you!

Patient Question:
what causes osteoporosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
with age bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin. for women the loss of bone density speeds up during the first five to seven years after menopause when there is a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. factors that increase a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis include: being thin or having a small frame. having a family history of osteoporosis. having the ovaries removed. smoking drinking more than moderately or living a sedentary lifestyle. white and asian women are more frequently affected than african-american and hispanic women. certain medical conditions such as kidney disease cushing's syndrome and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid gland increase bone breakdown. glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory drugs) anti-seizure drugs and prolonged immobility due to paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
osteoporosis is caused by a lack of bone strength or bone density. as you age your bones get thinner naturally. but some things can make you more likely to have the severe bone thinning of osteoporosis. these things are called risk factors. some risk factors you can change. others you can't change. risk factors you can't change include: your age. your risk for osteoporosis goes up as you get older. being a woman who has gone through menopause. after menopause the body makes less estrogen. estrogen protects the body from bone loss. your family background. osteoporosis tends to run in families. having a slender body frame. your race. people of european and asian background are most likely to get osteoporosis. risk factors you can change include: smoking. not getting enough weight -bearing exercise. drinking too much alcohol. not getting enough calcium and vitamin d in the things you eat or from supplements. to check your risk for osteoporosis use this interactive tool: are you at risk for osteoporosis? webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

alas the fda has not yet approved any testosterone for women's use for libido despite a significant number of studies showing it to be helpful (one of the studies has a really cool name the "aphrodite" study! ). testosterone patches for women have been approved in england and europe. so in the u. s. gynecologists have to do things in a somewhat roundabout manner. one is to have it compounded by a compounding pharmacy. the other is to use one of the male products in a much lower dose -- and what your gynecologist suggested is quite in line with what many of us do. i wouldn't use it at the standard dose for guys! but the dose he is suggesting is quite reasonable. just one thing to keep in mind: with any libido medicine it may take up to three months to see a significant response -- so as long as you are not suffering any adverse effects (like facial hair -- or other "masculinizing" effects) -- give it a three-month trial.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there can be many reasons to have a light menstrual period or spotting while on the pill. it does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. birth control pills taken properly of course are highly effective so your chance of an unintended pregnancy is not very high. can it happen? yes so if you are having any other signs of pregnancy a home pregnancy test or a visit to your gynecologist would be in something to consider.

yes women can spot on their birth control pills depending on their particular dosage etc. if this happens on a regular basis your medical provider may need to make a dosage adjustment. birth control pills offer excellent contraception. you are unlikely to be ovulating the day before your period so pregnancy would be unlikely as well.

a high thyroglobin antibody level in and of itself does not mean you have thyroid disease. they are found in nearly 20% of all women. however high levels of thyroglobulin antibodies associated with other thyroid antibodies are found in 80 to 90% of people with immune mediated inflammation of the thyroid (hashimoto’s thyroiditis). this is the most common type of thyroid hormone deficiency in the u. s. thyroglobulin antibodies are also found in pregnant women relatives of patients with hashimoto’s thyroiditis and in people with other immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes. the usual course of hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. antibodies to thyroglobulin are considered to occur as a result of damage to the thyroid from special white blood cells (t cells). common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue being cold all the time weight gain constipation dry skin and menstrual irregularities. since these symptoms occur in other diseases it is important not to always blame thyroid deficiency as the cause. fortunately laboratory tests for thyroid function make this diagnosis relatively easy. however because loss of thyroid hormone develops over time and antibodies can herald problems you will want to follow-up with your doctor about your thyroid tests and your symptoms.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should see a doctor specializing in lyme disease no matter how long ago that the rash was first observed. if you have lyme disease it can be and still needs to be treated. over 300 000 individuals per year are infected with lyme disease. the condition requires antibiotic treatment to eliminate all bacteria in order to stop further bodily organ damage. this bacteria will fester in the body forever until treated completely. the lyme disease process may start out with a skin rash fatigue and fever and be dismissed as being somewhat annoying but not being worthy of medical intervention. some later stage symptoms of the condition include heart damage neurological defects arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. best wishes for your improved health.

yes. at least 85% of women who have miscarriages have subsequent normal pregnancies and births. having a miscarriage does not necessarily mean you have a fertility problem. on the other hand about 1% to 2% of women may have repeated miscarriages (three or more). some researchers believe this is related to an autoimmune response. if you've had two miscarriages in a row you should stop trying to conceive use a form of birth control and ask your health care provider to perform diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the miscarriages.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sickle cell trait is a genetic disorder that occurs when a child inherits one sickle cell gene from a parent. if a child inherits two sickle cell genes (one from each parent) then that child will have sickle cell disease. so to answer your question if your son has been diagnosed with sickle cell trait then he had to have inherited a sickle cell gene from one of his parents. if you his mother know positively you don't have sickle cell trait (which is diagnosed by blood test) then your son must have received the gene from his father. sickle cell trait may never produce symptoms so you should not assume you don't have it unless you've been tested for it. your son needs to be aware that he can pass along this sickle cell gene to his own child. if the child's mother also has sickle cell trait (or sickle cell disease) the child can be born with sickle cell disease. hope this helps!

taking care of yourself every day is important in dealing with obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd). this includes taking your medicines as directed every day and doing the homework your therapist gives you to do at home such as self-directed exposure and response prevention exercises. with exposure and response prevention therapy you repeatedly expose yourself to an obsession such as something you fear is contaminated and deny yourself the ritual compulsive act which in this case would be washing your hands. it's also important to involve family members and loved ones in your treatment especially if your health professional suggested you participate in therapy together. keeping lines of communication open may help you deal with relationships that have become strained during your illness. reducing overall stress in your life although not proven treatment for ocd symptoms may help you cope. stress- and anxiety -relieving tips include: taking slow deep breaths. soaking in a warm bath. listening to soothing music. taking a walk or doing some other exercise. taking a yoga class. having a massage or back rub. drinking a warm nonalcoholic noncaffeinated beverage. eating a healthy balanced diet and avoiding certain foods or drinks may also help you reduce stress. avoid or limit caffeine. coffee tea some soda pop and chocolate contain caffeine. caffeine can make stressful situations seem more intense. if you drink a lot of caffeine reduce the amount gradually. stopping use of caffeine suddenly can cause headaches and make it hard to concentrate. if you drink alcohol do so in moderation. if you are feeling very stressed you might be turning to alcohol for relief more often than you realize. if you drink limit yourself to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. make mealtimes calm and relaxed. try not to skip meals or eat on the run. skipping meals can cause your blood sugar to drop which will make other stress-related symptoms worse such as headaches or stomach tension. eating on the run can cause indigestion. use mealtime to relax enjoy the flavor of your meal and reflect on your day. avoid eating to relieve stress. some people turn to food to comfort themselves when they are under stress. this can lead to overeating and guilt. if this is a problem for you try to replace eating with other actions that relieve stress like taking a walk playing with a pet or taking a bath. for more information see the topic stress management. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

can i bring my 88 year old father who has stage iv copd to denver where the altitude is 5500 feet. i would like my dad to come live his last days out with me. i certainly don't want to be the cause of his death but he is miserable where he is. is it worth the risk? we have an excellent oxygen concentrator that gives him a good pulse burst and he does breathing treatments. he wouldn't have to do anything that would cause over exertion. is it worth the risk?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you ask a fascinating question and one that is very worthy of discussing with your dad's physician. i tried to search for some relevant studies on this topic and did not find very many. in general people with copd do worse at high altitudes whether they have lived at altitude for a long term or not. the issues with ventilation at altitude are more complex than simple oxygen delivery. there also are issues of breathing mechanics and heart function that come into play. all of this is not to say you should not move your dad to be with you in denver. i'm saying it could be manageable if you discuss it in advance with some good doctors and learn what things you need to do to manage your dad's condition at high altitude. or you might both decide the risks are too great. my personal opinion is that quality of life matters more than quantity of life -- especially when a person reaches an advanced age. i would suggest you consult with your father's doctor (or with a physician in denver) to find out if the benefits for your dad would outweigh the risks. wishing you well!

the short answer is it depends. starting next year young adults who are younger than age 26 can stay on their parents' health insurance plans even if they have the option of enrolling in coverage offered by an employer. if you are in this situation you (and your family) should look carefully at the overall cost of adding you to your parents' plan compared to the cost you would have to pay for premiums under an employment-based option. in addition don't look only at premiums. consider factors as well such as: (1) whether your doctor or the hospital you may go to if you are sick are part of the two plan's networks; (2) how much coinsurance or copayments are for routine doctor's visits; and (3) what you will have to pay for prescription drugs under the various plans. and as always you should also listen to your parents! they may have views on this too.

how do i know if i have a kidney stone?

Actual Doctor's Response:
kidney stones usually show themselves through some specific symptoms though they only way to diagnose them for sure is through one or several tests such as a ct scan. if you're having any of these symptoms it's worth seeking medical attention: urge to urinate frequently possibly with little urine output sharp pains in the flanks or lower abdomen sometimes radiating toward the groin pacing the floor due to pain and the inability to find a comfortable position to sit or lie down in blood in the urine nausea and/or vomiting with the flank pain these are the classic signs of a kidney stone though other conditions can cause similar symptoms. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a mild-to-moderate basis you'd do well to make an appointment with your primary care provider. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a severe basis or if you find yourself nearly unable to urinate then a trip to urgent care or the emergency room is in order. only a health care provider can say for sure if you have kidney stones. i wish you well!

the basic cause of heartburn is an underactive lower esophageal sphincter or les that doesn't tighten as it should. two excesses often contribute to this problem: too much food in the stomach (overeating) or too much pressure on the stomach (frequently from obesity or pregnancy). certain foods commonly relax the les including tomatoes citrus fruits garlic onions chocolate coffee alcohol caffeinated products and peppermint. dishes high in fats and oils (animal or vegetable) often lead to heartburn as do certain medications. stress increases acid production and can cause heartburn. and smoking which relaxes the les and stimulates stomach acid is a major contributor.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian diets—ones that include eggs and dairy –or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat diet—just don’t go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website <link> also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you're wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for high blood pressure. doing this will help your health care provider titrate (fine-tune) your medication dosage appropriately. clinically low blood pressure is defined as anything under 90/60. (this can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual. ) if you've been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 90/60 as being too low. a normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. it's not unusual for a person's heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise. if you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider. because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment. there are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isn't working for you your doctor can try something else. i wish you all the best!

it is true that not all providers will be participating in all the plans offered through the marketplace. one of the ways insurance companies operate is by only contracting with providers who are willing to accept their terms. you may want to change providers to one who is in one of the plans offered in the marketplace. if you do not want to change plans you should compare what kind of out-of-network coverage each of the plans offers.

how can i keep my lips moist? they’re too dry.

Actual Doctor's Response:
for simply dry lips use an emollient that contains a sunblock. for cases of resistant dehydrated lips you may apply an over-the-counter hydrocortisone ointment (not cream) to your lips.

the blisters on your tongue could range from simple trauma (tongue biting and abrasions) to chemical or thermal burns (pizza) to systemic conditions caused by viruses (herpetic). a careful history and clinical examination are a must. if your family dentist has difficulty in reviewing your situation look up an oral pathologist a periodontist or oral surgeon. it is within the realm of their expertise. in general if the lesions disappear within two weeks they are benign and were caused by a transient condition such as trauma or virus. if problems and ulcers last a careful examination by a professional is needed.

thrush has a cottage cheese appearance in the mouth. usually creamy white spots dot your tongue or inner cheeks. most of the people i've worked with who have thrush say it's quite painful. thrush is basically a yeast infection of the mouth. it is caused by the candida fungus. it can be caused by uncontrolled diabetes hiv or even something as simple as taking antibiotics. you may be experiencing thrush or you may have something very common called fordyce spots. these usually occur along the lip line (vermilion border) or just inside the lips. this condition is benign (not life-threatening). if your tongue is numb or painful and covered with white spots you probably should get checked out by a doctor. if you're running a fever you definitely should get checked. you can't self-treat thrush so if you do have it you need to get a prescription mouth rinse. i hope this helps!

i have to force myself to eat i havent ate much in a week. so far this week i have ate a half bowl of oatmeal two sandwiches and some fries and its thursday my parents are worried i think and so am i. i am overweight and 13 so could it be my brain saying "hey fatty stop eating"? any help would be much appreciated! thanks

Actual Doctor's Response:
be happy of your body but also believe it is what you make of it! not eating is not a reaction by your brain instead eating is encouraged in order to meet the vitamins nutrients and protein your body needs to get through the day and promotes brain functions. not eating can also cause problems to the functions of your hypothalamus. if there has been any new medications in your regimen maybe that is a problem. i would encourage an exercise program as it has helped me in a daily routine of eating. exercise is necessary among individuals whether you are overweight or not due to the release of endorphins which is food for your brain and makes you feel better. i was able to trim 6% body fat in 3 months due to a steady exercise program of 6 days a week and i am even eating 5 meals a day to keep my calorie intake high. i would suggest the first week starting slower with 3 days a week in order to loosen your muscles. stretching is also a very important key to a successful workout in which should be done before and after. the best advice is to not give up on yourself. losing weight and eating healthy takes time to adjust but noticing results will help your morale and motives on a daily basis. your diet is the most important thing and needs adjusting in a more strict regimen of what and when to eat. if you begin exercising running for a half hour will burn roughly 300-500 calories depending on speed. keep in mind that is simply a large fry from mcdonalds. completely cut all of those greasy foods out and begin eating healthier to feel better. boosting metabolism is a great way to start so drinking a coffee or green tea in the morning is a great way to do so. no soda. milk is necessary for calcium but stay away from the fats! try almond milk for lower fat content and higher calcium water is a great thing to drink as it keeps you hydrated and well. breakfast: possible one-a-day for key nutrients and vitamins otherwise get cereal with vitamins and nutrients. my favorite is post grape nuts which has a lot of the vitamins required for a daily intake along with protein. oatmeal is also another good way to jump start your day. eggs are a great breakfast food for the proteins and omega-3. lunch: my personal go to is a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread greek yogurt and banana. tuna fish sandwich is also a good lunch meal dinner: be creative! pasta and chicken that is not breaded is very good for glutamine and starch for energy. quinoa is my personal favorite as it contains every essential amino acid (really good cooked in chicken brother instead of water). rice is another good one and i also prefer fish. these foods and more such as split peas and soy beans will help you keep a healthy balanced diet which will lower your sugar and saturated fat intake. i really hope this helps as it has changed my life greatly!

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer the medical provider who is treating you for strep is not really doing it correctly. if you do a brief search on "treating strep with azithromycin" you will see that the standard z-pack is not sufficient. strep should be treated with two pills (500mg) every day for five days; twice the dose you have been given. the purpose of any antibiotic in the treatment of lab-diagnosed strep (i hope you had a confirmation test to prove you did indeed have strep) is to prevent complications. not to treat the associated pain. antibitoics are not good pain medications so i would suggest that you take an appropriate dose of ibuprofen or have your medical provider prescribe something for you.

most people know that exercise keeps muscles strong. but did you know that strong muscles burn more calories? muscle mass is metabolically active tissue. in other words the more muscle mass you have the more calories you burn even when you're not working out. studies estimate that for each pound of muscle you add to your body you will burn an additional 35-50 calories per day. so an extra 5 pounds of muscle will burn about 175-250 calories a day or an extra pound of fat every 14-20 days. because guys have more muscle mass they burn calories faster and lose weight more easily than girls. so girls need to work out daily to stay strong and in shape.

" extracapsular surgery. your doctor makes a longer incision on the side of the cornea and removes the cloudy core of the lens in one piece. the rest of the lens is removed by suction. after the natural lens has been removed it often is replaced by an artificial lens called an intraocular lens (iol). an iol is a clear plastic lens that requires no care and becomes a permanent part of your eye. light is focused clearly by the iol onto the retina improving your vision. you will not feel or see the new lens. some people cannot have an iol. they may have another eye disease or have problems during surgery. for these patients a soft contact lens or glasses that provide high magnification may be suggested.

Actual Doctor's Response:
osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: " a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. " other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is no easy or definitive answer. expose to someone with active (visible fresh lesions) herpes the outbreak on the exposed person can be relatively fast. when genital herpes is dormant (no visible signs of the disease) the chance of exposure is considerably less but unfortunately not zero. many people who have contracted herpes were not aware that their partner was infected and ended up contracting it in this dormant stage so we do know that this virus can be shed even when lesions are not present.

studies tend to support that herpes can be transmitted during non-outbreak periods. unfortunately there is no way to know if the infected person is shedding the herpes virus at the time or if you yourself are susceptible. while persons who are actively infected pose the greatest transmission risk the smaller risk during non-outbreaks can happen. herpes tends to infect the area where the virus was contracted orally or genitally but there is a lot of cross-contamination during various sexual activities that often tend to involve both areas.

Actual Doctor's Response:
meloxicam is a prescription strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) while acetaminophen (tylenol) is an effective analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). aleve is an over-the-counter nsaid. i would not take aleve while taking meloxicam due to the increased risk of side effects and toxicity issues. if you need to take a pain reliever in addition to the meloxicam i would stick with the acetaminophen. if this doesn’t alleviate the migraine/headaches then i would consult your health care professional about the cause of the migraines and what can be used to treat the symptoms. meloxican & tylenol : meloxican(mobic) is a nsaid it's an antiinflamatory that decreases swelling. tylenol is an analgesic and used for acute pain. so they go hand in hand especially if you just injured something like a knee ankle something like that. take mobic at same time each day to even the blood and it's better to take with food. tylenol can be used as needed for pain. you can take meloxicam and tylenol together but i would not recommend that you take meloxicam and aleve together. refer here <link> can i take tylenol with meloxicam?

Patient Question:
what is heartburn?

Actual Doctor's Response:
heartburn is a burning discomfort that is generally felt in the chest just behind the breastbone. the burning sensation results when harsh stomach juices come in contact with and irritate the delicate lining of the esophagus. it is also known as acid indigestion.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
heartburn is an irritation of the esophagus that is caused by stomach acid. with gravity's help a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter or les keeps stomach acid in the stomach. the les is located where the esophagus meets the stomach -- below the rib cage and slightly left of center. normally it opens to allow food into the stomach or to permit belching; then it closes again. but if the les opens too often or does not close tight enough stomach acid can reflux or seep into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation. occasional heartburn isn't dangerous but chronic heartburn can indicate serious problems and can develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). heartburn is a daily occurrence for about 10% of americans and up to 50% of pregnant women. it's an occasional nuisance for 30% of the population.

Patient Question:
when i swallow i sometimes get crackling in my ear. is this an ear infection or just wax please

Actual Doctor's Response:
ear infections (middle ear infections) typically cause pain and often fever. if you are not experiencing these symptoms it is not very likely you have an ear infection. crackling sounds in the ear can be caused by many things; when the eustachian tubes (a tiny ventilation tube that runs from your middle ear - the area on the other side of your eardrum) equalizes pressure you may hear a pop or crackling sound. fluid (effusion) in the middle ear can cause crackling. yes even a wax impaction lying against the eardrum or a stray hair can do this. less commonly other middle ear and inner ear disorders can cause this sensation. the only way you can begin to pinpoint the cause is to see your medical provider or an ent for a hands-on examination. treatment would depend on on your diagnosis. i have the same thing crackling sound in ears i think it to do with my jaw but how? same herre?

if you are thinking about having a baby and you have high blood pressure talk first to your doctor or nurse. taking steps to control your blood pressure before and during pregnancy -- and getting regular prenatal care -- go a long way toward ensuring your well-being and your baby's health. before becoming pregnant: be sure your blood pressure is under control. lifestyle changes such as limiting your salt intake participating in regular physical activity and losing weight if you are overweight can be helpful. discuss with your doctor how hypertension might affect you and your baby during pregnancy and what you can do to prevent or lessen problems. if you take medicines for your blood pressure ask your doctor whether you should change the amount you take or stop taking them during pregnancy. experts currently recommend avoiding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin ii (aii) receptor antagonists during pregnancy; other blood pressure medications may be ok for you to use. do not however stop or change your medicines unless your doctor tells you to do so. while you are pregnant: obtain regular prenatal medical care. avoid alcohol and tobacco. talk to your doctor about any over-the-counter medications you are taking or are thinking about taking.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think you're wise to get a second opinion. whether or not the x-rays look "fine " the truth is you're symptomatic. you deserve to learn why you're having problems. the main reason i wanted to respond though is to suggest you take your temperature. if you have a fever i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for some blood work. a fever can be a sign of infection and infection of a prosthetic knee is always a possibility. if you do have an infection you'd want to get that treated as soon as possible. while you're waiting for your appointment with the second doctor i'd suggest you use an assistive device to help stabilize your balance so you don't fall. either a 4-point cane or a walker would be ideal. the last thing you want is to sustain an injury before you get your knee problem figured out. wishing you all the best and hoping you feel better soon!

Actual Doctor's Response:
home pregnancy tests are very accurate. if you're 2 weeks late and have had 2 negative tests it's unlikely that you're pregnant. many of the symptoms you mention would be quite unusual so early in pregnancy or are not typically associated with pregnancy at all so i would not assume that's what's going on. you should see your doctor to see what is going on as it doesn't sound like pregnancy is the most likely thing at this point.

Actual Doctor's Response:
a diet to help control diabetes is often individually prescribed -- based on body weight and lifestyle -- to help keep blood sugar levels in control. the best snacks for diabetics will contain some protein and some fiber to help slow down food absorption and therefore help control blood sugar levels and prevent spiking. avoid simple sugars such as in cookies and candies and choose whole grain crackers low-fat cheeses maybe a slice of turkey or leftover chicken. and pair these foods with a small amount of fruit if desired. know that fruit while healthy can be high in natural sugars that will spike blood sugar levels unless combined with a protein source to slow down their absorption in your body.

my dad suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma doc prescribed sorafenib tablets. is it gonna work?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm very sorry to hear about your dad. this must be a difficult time for you and your family. hepatocellular carcinoma as you probably know is liver cancer. sorafenib is a medication (chemotherapy drug) designed to slow the spread of cancer cells. it probably will not cure the cancer but it may help slow down the disease. if your dad or your family has questions about any of the medications the doctor is prescribing you should feel free to make an appointment to discuss the issue. some questions you might want to ask are: what does this medication do? what is the goal of this drug therapy? how should this drug be taken? what are possible side effects of this medication? are there other medications that could be used? if so why are you choosing this particular drug? what happens if the drug does not work as expected? what would the "next step" be? sorafenib has produced good results during clinical trials in terms of extending survival rates of people with liver cancer. i am hoping your dad is among the many who benefit from this treatment. i wish you and your family all the best!

this is a common question that i get asked all the time and i really would advise the patient to not take maalox with it. maalox can actually bind to the vitamin and will not make it work as well. it will actually prevent it from being absorbed in the body. there are a few tricks though that i recommend to my patients to help avoid this nausea feeling and part of it is number one. taking it with some food around meal time maybe dinner is a good opportunity to take your vitamins and as long as there is something in your stomach it may actually counteract that nauseous feeling. also i found that a lot of women take it at bedtime. i recommend it pretty consistently and they say that it really works because you take it right before you go to bed. you are sleeping so the vitamins are dissolving and you are not awake to experience that nauseous feeling. but if you are having severe nausea talk to your pharmacist you may need to be switched to a different type of prenatal vitamin. i will be more than happy to call your physician or healthcare provider to talk to them about that for you.

Patient Question:
what's the best way to shave my face?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most men shave their face on a daily basis; here are a few tips for a more comfortable shave. the best time to shave is after you shower. the warm water allows the pores to open and also softens facial hair before shaving. always apply a shaving cream or shave gel to prepare your skin before shaving. using a shave brush (natural bristles are best) instead of your hands is the best way to apply your shaving cream. a shaving brush will help your whiskers to stand up and will result in a closer shave; using your hands will actually push the hair down. as you shave go with the grain not against it. this will help to prevent hair bumps from forming. the top layer of skin is exfoliated as you shave; therefore it is important to moisturize your skin after you shave. this will replace any moisture that was taken away during shaving. it is best to use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful uv rays.

Actual Doctor's Response:
she most likely suggested stopping the hct part of the benicar since the hct refers to hydrochlorothiazide a diuretic that helps lower blood pressure by acting as a water pill. the effects of a water pill can bring on or worsen urinary incontinence since it makes you have to urinate more often.

i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing "bridge therapy" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you

it is uncommon to follow a low glucose diet as it is found in many carbohydrate foods and a true allergy is rare. table sugar or sucrose is made up of two simple sugars fructose and glucose. fruits and vegetables also contain both fructose and glucose. lactose the sugar in milk is made up of the simple sugars glucose and galactose. glucose is also part of corn syrup high fructose corn syrup honey and other syrups. you may have been advised to follow a low sugar diet or low glycemic diet. that would mean choosing whole foods without added sugars such as fruits vegetables whole grains lean meats unsweetened dairy products. check labels for words that are code for sugar such as maltose dextrose brown rice syrup high fructose corn syrup malt syrup molasses cane sugar corn sweetener raw sugar fruit juice concentrate syrup honey and evaporated cane juice. for more on hidden foods with added sugars see this article <link> this article reviews a low glycemic diet <link> always check with a healthcare provider when following a restricted diet.

all things considered it’s in the patient’s interest that the surgery be done in less time rather than more time because the lack of efficiency that would translate a shorter operation to a longer operation has a consequence of more swelling and more bruising. it is a natural tendency for human tissue when being manipulated for 4 hours to swell more than it would if it were manipulated for 2 hours or say 1 hour. the drugs that we inject at the time of surgery and this is after the patient is asleep which numb the tissue allowing a lighter anesthetic by the anesthesia specialist also contains that anesthetic drug also contains a drug to shrink the blood vessels to clamp off the blood supply so that we’re not operating in a pool of blood. otherwise we couldn’t do our work we can’t see. but that is not an indefinite period of time. in other words it’s pretty finite. after an hour to an hour and a half that drug wears off the blood vessels start to open up and now they leak more. so ideally you’d like to get that operation done or at least that part of the operation done in less than an hour to an hour and a half. therefore the object generally in nasal surgery which has big potential for significant bleeding get the operation done in less than an hour. whether you’re operating for cosmetic purposes or cosmetic and even breathing purposes you’ve got about one golden hour to do the work. so if you do it less swelling less bruising. now we do have the help of some medications. but they are not always as predictable and they effect different people and bruising is a phenomenon for example that can depend on everything from your natural innate tendency to bruise some people say i’m a bruiser some aren’t to for a woman what point in the menstrual cycle are they. oh yeah. so you’ve got all these factors in play and we haul out all the best drugs we can. in order to reduce the bruising we have the anesthesiologist inject an anti swelling medication even prior to the outset of the operation before we make the first incision so that we know that there’s this big rush of drugs that have now been absorbed into the body and are available to reduce the swelling.

Actual Doctor's Response:
managing stress can play an important role in combating cancer-related fatigue. here are some suggestions that may help. adjust your expectations. for example if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. a sense of accomplishment goes a long way to reducing stress. help others understand and support you. family and friends can be helpful if they can "put themselves in your shoes" and understand what fatigue means to you. cancer groups can be a source of support as well. other people with cancer understand what you are going through. relaxation techniques such as audiotapes that teach deep breathing or visualization can help reduce stress. activities that divert your attention away from fatigue can also be helpful. for example activities such as knitting reading or listening to music require little physical energy but require attention. if your stress seems out of control talk to a health care professional.

many of us with fm have to work and we may be faced with a major dilemma: our fibro interferes with our jobs. this creates stress often extreme financial stress if the job cannot be performed properly. whether the fm was caused by a work injury or whether work is aggravating the pre-existing fm changes may have to be made in how work is approached to minimize pain and functional impairment. job considerations: different factors influence our job abilities. we have a difficult time reaching using our arms overhead bending lifting and being in one position for a long time. we have no business even being in some of the jobs we do since the job duties are so unrealistic for us. even jobs that involve little or no lifting may not be tolerated if it involves a lot of reaching or repetitions. some examples of "high risk" jobs for us include assembly-line jobs hairstyling bus driving computer work and cashier jobs. even sedentary less physically demanding jobs can be stressful because it's hard to focus concentrate and be productive if we hurt all over have headaches and brain fog etc. we can come up with a list of work things to do that's best for our fm. i mean things that we can modify at work to keep us productive and with minimal pain despite our fibro. here are some examples of things that you your doctor and your therapist can try to do. --hours: stay on day shift avoid overtime can you have a flexible schedule? decrease commute time? is part-time more feasible? can you make up missed time? --building: can you park close? use elevator instead of stairs? --work environment: can you control the thermostat? avoid drafts bright lights noise. minimize interruptions/disruptions. is your furniture and work station ergonomically efficient? --physical: can you alternate positions? sit more? lie down during breaks? pace your work? --work load: can you rotate tasks? can you prioritize deadlines? delegate to others? can you ease pressure on work quotas? are others depending on your work before they can finish theirs? --insurance: is it adequate? paid medical leave? pharmacy plan? reasonable accomodations: the employee the employer and the doctor can work together to create a safe workplace with minimal pain hopefully. the americans with disabilities act requires employers to provide equal employment opportunities for people who are able to do the job but who are limited by physical disabilities. the employee has a right to reasonable accomodations provided by the employer to help overcome any physical limitations. examples of reasonable accommodations for fm workers might include: --allowing frequent breaks during the workday --rearranging work stations and providing ergonomic tools or furniture to optimize proper body mechanics and use fibronomics. --providing phones with headsets --using a drop keyboard wrist bars and arm rests on your computer --no direct air conditioning drafts --restrictions on repetitive activities. family medical leave act: the fmla was passed to allow workers to take time off work when they (or family members) are incapacitated and require medical treatment for a serious or chronic health condition. i complete these forms often when necessary and will state that fm is a chronic condition that may unpredictably flare up from time to time resulting in impairment of work ability and may require time off work on a temporary basis. we try to prioritize returning to work and staying at work as much as possible.

Actual Doctor's Response:
interestingly yes the two things could be related. and you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can. under certain circumstances it's possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye. this is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse. usually though this sort of situation occurs when there's a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself. thus the symptoms you're experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye. while this isn't an emergency i'd recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out what's going on. no sense taking chances with your vision! best to you!

Actual Doctor's Response:
based on the description i am not sure why you are assuming gallbladder cancer since it is quite rare. maybe the doctor indicated that was a concern. ultrasound results are available quickly so i wouldn't let that part worry you. however unintentional weight loss is a concern and i'm glad that her doctor is getting to the bottom of what's going on. to answer your specific question gallbladder cancer is not common and fewer than 10 000 people are diagnosed with it every year (including cancers of the gallbladder bile ducts). it is usually found fairly late because it's often advanced by the time someone has significant syptoms. if it's found early which happens in about 1 in 5 people there is the possibility to cure it. but even if it can't be cured treatment can definitely help prolong life.

head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system. just the mention of head lice will make you scratch (i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now). head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood. yes head lice are vampires — they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases. lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department. lice lay dozens of eggs (nits); eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species. as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now! now you can scratch your head. it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy. school systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. schools must have a team of nit nazis. insects are taking over our world. actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world. dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. termites are eating our homes. flies are landing on our dinner plate. ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. kids — even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes — can get head lice. i know. my long-haired daughter brought some home many years ago. girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. i often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well. i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. “your daughter has head lice. ” “what! are you sure? could it be something else? ” “no. she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp-crickets also known as the common cootie. you probably have them too. ” like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like nix) malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested stromectal — a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive. there is a lice-smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta people don’t know you are killing innocent lice. my late grandmother mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist used kerosene. once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring the next job is to manually remove the nits. there are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft but in the end adults end up just picking them out one at a time. there may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. lice do not respect social status so anyone can get them. if your kids bring them home from school then you will need to go to def con 4. the recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. vacuum the carpets and mattresses but again lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. it is not necessary to burn down the house and move.

nighttime heartburn tends to leave acid in the esophagus longer and therefore may cause more damage than daytime heartburn. nighttime heartburn can also result in chronic insomnia. many people can find relief by: avoiding foods that can lead to heartburn such as alcohol chocolate and spicy or fatty foods. not eating anything for two to three hours before bedtime. chewing gum in the evening to boost saliva. putting blocks under the top of the mattress to elevate the head four to six inches. taking antacids which neutralize the acid in the stomach; h2 receptor antagonists which reduce the production of acid by the stomach; or a proton pump inhibitor.

Patient Question:
why do i yawn after 30-40 minutes of exercising?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it doesn’t seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because you’re fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isn’t one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance. iron deficiency

plz answer correctly. i don't think you understood the question. i was drinking orange juice it seemed to go the wrong way and i hacked a little but did not cough. one hour after drinking i felt a little tickly so i coughed once intentionally. any danger?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer had you aspirated a sufficient amount of orange juice or any liquid for that matter into your lungs i can assure you that you would have immediately coughed and coughed extensively as your body clears your airway. you have two lungs -- three separate lobes on the right and two lobes on the left so even if you did accidentally aspirate a tiny amount it would be harmless. and would not result in a situation that one would call drowning.

Actual Doctor's Response:
ultrasounds help health professionals estimate weight but it is impossible to be precise with weight until the baby is born. your healthcare provider will measure baby's growth in a variety of ways to make sure everything is on track and should alert you if it is not. for example they will measure the size of the head and the length of the bones on ultrasounds monitor your weight and size. it is best to address growth concerns with your doctor who is following your case closely. see this article for more details of growth during the second trimester of pregnancy. congrats on your pregnancy!

Actual Doctor's Response:
rarely individuals with acute infections with hepatitis a and hepatitis b develop severe inflammation and the liver fails (acute fulminant hepatitis). these patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis and the additional problems of confusion or coma (due to the liver's failure to detoxify chemicals) and bruising or bleeding (due to a lack of blood clotting factors). in fact up to 80% of people with acute fulminant hepatitis can die within days to weeks; therefore it is fortunate that acute fulminant hepatitis is rare. for example less than 0. 5% of adults with acute infection with hepatitis b will develop acute fulminant hepatitis.

Patient Question:
me and my daughter just might have ate bad meat what could happen

Actual Doctor's Response:
well you will know soon enough if the meat you ate was spoiled or otherwise "bad. " usually food poisoning starts with diarrhea but may also include nausea vomiting and abdominal cramps. the onset of symptoms depends on which bacterium is causing the food poisoning. there are more than a dozen organisms that can cause food poisoning. e. coli is a common cause of food poisoning from meat. symptoms from e. coli usually begin 3 to 4 days after exposure to the organism. many cases of food poisoning go away on their own. it's important not to take any anti-diarrhea medications if you begin having food poisoning-related diarrhea as this is the body's way of getting rid of the toxin. however diarrhea can be very dehydrating so it's important to drink plenty of water during this time. if your daughter is very young and begins to exhibit the signs of food poisoning such as diarrhea that is accompanied by severe abdominal pain or doesn't stop after 24 hours i'd suggest you seek immediate medical treatment. the same is true if either of you experiences numbness or tingling of the hands face or feet or if you experience confusion. i hope the meat was fine and neither of you suffers any ill effect! you will soon know

gonorrhea is one of the main causes of pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) and yes this can be very painful. you need to be under the on-going care of a primary care medical provider or gynecologist until this std has been cured. without the ability to examine you first-hand it would not be possible to determine the cause or significance of the pain you are experiencing now. only the medical provider who is treating you and has examined you can make that important call.

it is possible that the act of intercourse or the condom caused irritation of the labia minora. i am not sure if you had just had intercourse the second time you had the burning sensation. if you did then that may very well be the reason. it is also possible that there is a sexually transmitted infection despite your negative testing. it depends on what you were tested for and what you were not tested for. there are so many stds that is would be very difficult to test for everything. the most common testing is for gonorrhea and chlamydia. in addition i usually recommend testing for herpes as well as hiv. the burning sensation may also be from a non-sexually transmitted infection such as yeast or bacteria. regardless you should schedule an exam and discuss this with your doctor.

there is really little that can be done over the internet other than to offer you some advice. i don't know your husband's complete medical history or have any way to medically evaluate his memory issues but he does have some obvious contributory factors: tobacco marijuana use poor nutrition (a guess) insomnia due to unknown factors and perhaps many many other issues. he will need to see a medical professional to start the evaluation process assuming you will be able to convince him to do so. encouraging him to give up tobacco and marijuana may be futile but at least you can try and work on him.

honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test. even if all the signs (like throat redness) and symptoms (like soreness) are there it still may not be strep. even "white spots" in the back of the mouth are no guarantee it's a case of strep. strep throat is almost always accompanied by fever. are you using a thermometer to measure your son's temperature or are you relying on the old hand-to-the-forehead method? it's very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever. i mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets. keep in mind also if you're giving your son acetaminophen (tylenol) to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a "normal" temperature on the thermometer (because acetaminophen is a fever-reducer). instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son i suggest you take him to his pediatrician. since the problem has been going on for nearly a week it's not a bad idea to get medical attention. i hope your little boy feels better soon! wishing you well!

a new study out of columbia university suggests that sleep deprivation may actually make you eat more. they found that: people who are sleep-deprived will eat more foods high in fat and protein when compared to other women who had slept nine hours women who had only slept four hours consumed 329 more calories on average when compared to other men who had slept nine hours men who had only slept four hours consumed 263 more calories on average while both men and women ate more high-protein food sleep-deprived women ate on average 31 more grams of fat than did their male counterparts. there are several possible reasons that people with less sleep eat more. less sleep leads to poor judgment in many situations and if you’re very tired throughout the day you may either eat more food to attempt to stay awake or constantly look for quick fixes like energy drinks and bars which are more often than not full of sugar and calories (they also can make it even more difficult to fall asleep which makes the problem of eating because of sleep deprivation that much worse).

most helpful answer the important thing is that you understand why the dessert is in your meal plan. talking with your therapist is key because he or she is likely doing it to help change your relationship with food. the tendency with eating disorders/disordered eating is people give too much power to a single food instead of looking at the overall pattern of eating. as for your health no eating a sweet food everyday will not ruin your health (i do it! ) especially when your diet is balanced. it's the extremes that are harmful -- eating sweets/chips/empty calorie foods all day long or eliminating so many foods/items that it's hard to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy eating. i hope that helps. good luck on your journey!

well maybe. if you shared a straw with someone who has ever had a cold sore (caused by the herpes simplex virus ) then yes. even if the person had no active cold sore it's still possible to pick up the virus from them. and not necessarily just from the straw -- if you shared a glass bottle or can of soda with a person who has hsv then you could get the virus from them. the odds of getting a cold sore from a random can bottle or glass of soda (that is not a container someone else drank from) is very very small. if you developed a cold sore after enjoying a frosty beverage it's likely you were exposed to hsv some time before you drank the soda and the two events are not related. hope this helps!

Patient Question:
when i get upset i feel nauseous i can't beathe and my stomach hurts i get really depressed. should i talk to a doctor? . i was just wondering if i should see a doctor. when i get upset i feel overwhelmed. i can't breathe my stomach starts to hurt and i feel nauseous. i feel alone and really depressed. i can't do anything i use to enjoy with the same enjoyment. this can last for a couple days. it's something that occurs quite often. i was just wondering if i should see a doctor or if this is okay.

Actual Doctor's Response:
no this is not ok. yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist. depression is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it. the same is true of anxiety which might be what you're experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe. you are not alone in your feelings. many people experience the same things which i hope brings you comfort. a doctor can help you figure out what's going on and suggest treatment for you. you deserve to live a happy full fulfilled life. you're worth it. personally i do not believe in taking antidepressants without "talk therapy" (also called cognitive therapy). i think you might benefit from a combination of both and i encourage you to seek this help. i wish you all the best!

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi having unprotected sex 2 to 3 days before day 14 yes you could end up being pregnant but for some women having unprotected sex anytime of the month means pregnancy just one of those things. all you can do is wait to see if you miss your period then get a test done either an hpt or see your doctor. hope this helps. good luck

Patient Question:
i am taking the bupropion xl generic does it work the same as wellbutrin xl?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer generic medications contain the same active ingredient(s) as their brand-name counterparts. they may contain different binders and inactive ingredients. in the u. s. generic drugs are regulated by the food and drug administration (fda) and are required to meet the same quality standards as brand name drugs. research has shown that generic drugs work just as well as brand name drugs. that said there are always slight variations in purity and strength between batches of mass-produced medications. this is true of all drugs that are mass produced both name brand and generic. the fda regulates how much variation is allowed and it's not very much. if you have recently switched from a brand-name medication to a generic version and feel it isn't working as effectively you should talk to your health care provider about it. he or she can help you determine the best course of treatment. best wishes to you!

can fillers replace plastic surgery?

Actual Doctor's Response:
fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn “i-was-strapped-to-a-747? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery can’t take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they don’t answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as i’ve said many a time one shoe does not fit all.

what causes ringworm of the scalp or beard?

Actual Doctor's Response:
ringworm infection is caused by a fungus. fungi that cause ringworm live and multiply on the upper layer of the skin and on the hair. ringworm is not caused by a worm or other parasite. the medical term for fungal infections is tinea followed by a word that describes the location of infection. for example tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp and tinea barbae is ringworm of the beard. ringworm of the scalp is most commonly caused by the fungus trichophyton tonsurans which is spread from one person to another. this fungus causes more than 90 out of 100 cases of ringworm of the scalp in north and central america. 1 in the past the fungus microsporum canis was the most common cause but it is a less frequent cause now. microsporum canis is spread by cats and dogs. ringworm of the beard is caused by trichophyton verrucosum and is spread by cattle and other farm animals. you can catch ringworm by sharing contaminated hats combs brushes towels telephones clothing sports equipment or even theater seats and by direct contact with an infected person. children are more susceptible to the fungus and more likely to develop an infection than adults. adults often do not develop an infection even after exposure to ringworm-causing fungi. adults and less commonly children can be carriers for ringworm. carriers can pass ringworm on to others but do not have symptoms of the disease. ringworm-causing fungi can live on people objects (such as hats or brushes) or animals for several months. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance. and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal. i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size. society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of "masculinity " after all. i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size. but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist. he or she can examine you and tell you if everything's ok. also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isn't measured based on the erect organ. rather penis size is measured by "stretched penis length. " the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor. i hope this helps set your mind at ease! don't worry about it. the average penis in america is 6 inches. i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine. she says it is just right and doesn't hurt her. you are probably going by the magazines and movies. trust me they are not normal sized. we are created individually and when you find mrs. right she won't care. there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length. they do work. it is a slow process but it can be done. also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate. again its a slow process but it is possible. there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on. also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself. if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you. if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?

Patient Question:
what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?

Actual Doctor's Response:
here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. 1: control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. 2: exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. 3: avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. 4: eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega-3 fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.

Patient Question:
what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?

Actual Doctor's Response:
having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving (see medical issues below). women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.

i can tell you first and foremost that since you've never actually had sex you're definitely not pregnant - you can't get pregnant from masturbation for several reasons so that's one problem you don't have to worry about. as to why your period is late it's not that uncommon for women - especially younger women - to have some irregularity as to how long between each one; anywhere between 21 days and 45 days is possible and since you're not a fully mature woman just yet it is likely just a hormonal thing that comes with growing up. as you get older it is likely that your cycle will become more steady. although there can still be some variation as to the length it will probably not be as long. it is unlikely there is anything seriously wrong since this is only the second time your period isn't "on time" and we can be certain that you're not pregnant. i doubt you have anything to worry about especially if you are feeling otherwise normal. you could of course talk to your family doctor if you are still concerned or any other problems arise - your body will let you know if things are truly getting out of order - but like i said it's more than likely that you're fine.

" joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called "mutilans" can cause rapid damage to the joints. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis. aside from arthritis and spondylitis psoriatic arthritis can cause inflammation in other organs such as the eyes lungs and aorta. inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (iris) causes iritis a painful condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. corticosteroids injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent blindness. inflammation in and around the lungs (pleuritis) causes chest pain especially with deep breathing as well as shortness of breath. inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valve valves leading to heart failure and shortness of breath. acne and nail changes are commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. interestingly these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. acne has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. in fact a new syndrome has been described characterized by inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) acne and pustules on the feet or palms thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis) and bone inflammation (osteitis). this syndrome is therefore given the eponym sapho syndrome.

symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited function of joints. inflammation of the joints from arthritis is characterized by joint stiffness swelling redness and warmth. tenderness of the inflamed joint can be present. many of the forms of arthritis because they are rheumatic diseases can cause symptoms affecting various organs of the body that do not directly involve the joints. therefore symptoms in some patients with certain forms of arthritis can also include fever gland swelling (swollen lymph nodes) weight loss fatigue feeling unwell and even symptoms from abnormalities of organs such as the lungs heart or kidneys.

Patient Question:
if you do sex every alternate day on the week of your ovulation will you be pregnant with a boy? . hi. my doc told me to try to every alternate day after 12 days from 1st date your period started. . i am want to get pregnant with a boy and i know if you have sex on the day of ovulation your chances of having a boy increases coz there is a chance the y chrome will get attached to the egg. as i dont know the exact day of my ovulation and if i have sex every other day from day 12 is there a chance i get pregnant with a boy? . thanks.

Actual Doctor's Response:
that is silly advice but you do have a 50/50 chance of having a boy (or girl) no matter when you have sex. every day or every other day. chromosomes are inside the sperm and egg. the "y" doesn't really attach to anything. the fastest sperm is often the one that impregnates you so if you want a boy all you can do is hope that the sperm swims like michael phelps. there are many old wive's tales about techniques to improve your chances of having a boy or girl but in the end those techniques are no better than a coin toss. if you get what you want you will praise the method you used. if you don't you will not recommend it to anyone. so let nature make the decision for you and don't stress out about the sex of a baby that has not been conceived yet. just hope for a happy healthy baby.

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a vexing problem for post-menopausal women. i'm sorry you're going through it. while hormone therapy (often estrogen cream delivered directly to the vaginal tissue) is usually recommended to help with the dryness and atrophy (shrinking) of the vagina after menopause other options are available. assuming you're not allergic to any of the ingredients you could try an over-the-counter vaginal moisturizer such as replens brand. this is not the same thing as lubricant used during sex. a vaginal moisturizer works to keep delicate vaginal tissues moist and supple. at least that's the theory. i don't know about the science behind it but it probably can't hurt. there are several brands of vaginal moisturizers on the market. an old-fashioned method to maintain vaginal tissue health is the boric acid suppository. ask your gynecologist about this. you can have boric acid suppositories prepared at a compounding pharmacy. they work to help moisturize and maintain the ph of vaginal tissue. most important don't give up. keep talking to your gynecologist about the problem because new products and strategies for dealing with vaginal dryness are constantly being developed. wishing you well!

do not try to "pop" your ears. your perforated eardrum is trying to heal and any increased pressure from tying to pop them could interfere with the natural healing (which may take several weeks depending on the size of the perforation). the feeling you are experiencing may be more related to the inflammation of your eardrum than the need to pop your ears.

Actual Doctor's Response:
before making any recommendations i would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using. . it is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any over-the-counter fever reducers. so it is likely to be fine. i would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughter's fever based on her age weight and the other medications she's taking.

you can take acetaminophen (tylenol others) for pain. you will want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin ibuprofen (advil motrin others) or naproxen (aleve). these are likely to make your symptoms worse for crohn's disease.

for common skin warts many dermatologists agree that it’s perfectly fine to try over-the-counter wart treatments for a couple of months. if your warts don’t go away during that time or if they get worse it may be wise to seek medical attention. dermatologists have a variety of wart treatment and removal techniques that are stronger and work faster than commercially available products. also remember that all warts can be “mother” warts that give rise to additional warts in your skin. so the faster you remove the wart the less likely it will spread.

yes. two tests can be used to detect prostate cancer in the absence of any symptoms. one is the digital rectal exam (dre) in which a doctor feels the prostate through the rectum to find hard or lumpy areas. the other is a blood test used to detect a substance made by the prostate called prostate-specific antigen (psa). together these tests can detect many "silent" prostate cancers that have not caused symptoms. due to the widespread implementation of psa testing in the united states approximately 90 percent of all prostate cancers are currently diagnosed at an early stage and consequently men are surviving longer after diagnosis. at present however it is not known whether routine prostate screening saves lives. screening is a term used to describe tests when they are done in individuals who are not experiencing any symptoms. the benefits of screening and local therapy (surgery or radiation) remain unclear for many patients. because of this uncertainty the national cancer institute (nci) a part of the national institutes of health is currently supporting research to learn more about screening men for prostate cancer. currently researchers are conducting a large study to determine whether screening men using a blood test for psa and a dre can help reduce the death rate from this disease. they are also assessing the risks of screening. full results from this study the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial (plco) are expected by 2015.

this is a great question and i'm so glad you asked. many people associate gastrointestinal upset (nausea diarrhea) with the flu (influenza) but actually the true flu doesn't usually produce any of these symptoms. sometimes people refer to the "stomach flu " which is actually a condition called "gastroenteritis. " the nausea and diarrhea you're experiencing likely are caused by something other than influenza a. have you by chance taken antibiotics recently? if so that class of medications can cause gastrointestinal upset. this condition usually gets better after you finish the course of antibiotics. you also should consider eating yogurt or taking a probiotic to help with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. be sure to drink plenty of water whenever you have diarrhea -- and wash your hands thoroughly in case you're carrying a bug that can be passed to others. if the diarrhea doesn't clear up within 14 days or so another trip to the doctor is in order to try to figure out what's causing the problem. wishing you well!

you need to see your doctor right away if you are having trouble swallowing your food. there can be many possible causes for trouble swallowing. some can be very serious. here are a few of the things that can cause difficulty swallowing: • the esophagus (the tube that runs from your mouth to your stomach) may be partially blocked by a tumor or web. it may also be narrow due to severe reflux. • a swelling in a surrounding area such as the thyroid or lymph node may be pressing in on the esophagus. • there could be a problem with the nerves or muscles that are involved in swallowing • poor teeth can be preventing food from being properly chewed • diseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may prevent the esophagus from moving the food along webmd has a very good article on difficulty swallowing that can give you some more information. but do call your doctor now and make an appointment to have this checked out.

usually when ammonia is high there is trouble with the liver since it is the organ that breaks down protein to ammonia. it is no longer standard practice to subscribe very low protein diets with liver disease (i'm not sure how much your doctor is recommending). the key is to eat the right amount of protein -- not too much but not too little. the total protein measures the amount of protein in the blood which could be affected by your diet. i recommend seeing a registered dietitian who can explain to you the amount of protein you need and how it relates to all of your blood levels. read more: total serum protein ammonia blood test

i'm breastfeeding and didn't realize peptobismol wasn't safe. i only took 1 dose how long should i avoid breastfeeding? . i got norovirus and the stomach pain has been awful so i took one dose of peptobismol without realizing it wasn't safe for breastfeeding. i just researched it and all sites basically say to avoid it due to the risk of reye's syndrome and other risks to the baby. how long should i avoid breastfeeding?

Actual Doctor's Response:
breast feed your baby. the chance of you or your baby getting reye syndrome or having any consequences after one dose. for the tiny amount of salicylates (aspirin) in the pepto bismol. would be highly highly unlikely. what is more important is that you stay well-hydrated and nourished until the virus has abated. if this is not possible you can temporarily switch the baby to supplemental formulas or any stored breast milk until you are up to the mission again. get better. you baby will be fine if you resume breast-feeding.

a thick white vaginal discharge without a smell is normal. hormonal levels affect the amount and color of your vaginal discharge. since birth control pills contain hormones it is natural that they will affect your vaginal discharge. some birth control pills contain higher levels of estrogen and some are progesterone only without estrogen. if the discharge is bothersome it may be advisable to change to a different type of birth control. the concern with your discharge is that it smells. this could be a sign of an infection. you should see your gynecologist about your discharge and discuss whether it is a sign of infection and whether another birth control pill would be better for you. the estrogen in birth control pills lowers the acidity of secretions in your vagina and increases your risk of yeast infections. a vaginal yeast infection usually causes a sore itchy vagina with a thick clumpy white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese. as long as a vaginal discharge is not associated with pain itching discoloration or a bad odor it can be a positive effect. a vaginal discharge helps lubricate the vagina for intercourse. in women who are not on birth control vaginal discharge can indicate whether or not ovulation is occurring. during ovulation women have an abundant clear wet and stretchy discharge. many women compare the discharge at ovulation to raw egg whites.

Patient Question:
how long before i can i return to sports like the one that injured my finger in the first place? . my middle and ring fingers got caught in the elastic waste band of my opponents shorts as i pulled their flag. both fingers injured but i felt a "pop" in my middle finger. i squeezed the middle finger from the top and bottom and felt something move and the discomfort decreased a great deal but on day 3 after injury and wearing a splint i no longer have range of motion whereas i did have full motion on the day of injury.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer a release to "return to sports" will need come from your medical provider -- the one that examined you for your injury. healing time is so very individual that it would be impossible to blindly determine when you can play sports again since i cannot examine your fingers to see if they are healed. as much as i would like to help you with your question this is not something that can be done over the internet.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you have symptoms of a stroke it's important to seek immediate medical attention. one-sided weakness can be a sign of stroke. here are other common symptoms: sudden vision changes sudden problems walking sudden severe headache sudden inability to speak most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case. if your one-sided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor. i can't think of any reason why anxiety would cause one-sided weakness. i suppose it's possible it could be a medication side-effect but this still deserves to be checked out. i suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible. best wishes to you!

in a word: yes. the symptoms you list generally are consistent with lumbar spinal stenosis assuming the symptoms are occurring in the area below the waist. spinal stenosis is a fancy term that means "narrowing of the spinal canal. " the spinal canal is the hole in the middle of the vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes. many things can cause narrowing of the spinal canal. osteoarthritis is a key culprit. as you can imagine anything that "narrows" the spinal canal puts pressure on the spinal nerves. this can result in irritation of the nerves. when nerves get irritated they send out signals. these signals often are characterized as "stinging " "pinching" or "shock-like. " since the lumbar spine is the lower segment where you back curves in the nerves there supply the legs and other structures. if you've been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and you're experiencing pinching and stinging sensations in the legs that could be consistent with your diagnosis. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:

Actual Doctor's Response:
gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products. people on a gluten-free diet often avoid wheat rye and barley; though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well. a gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meat/poultry/fish and many dairy products. unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy. if not buying fresh food it’s important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as gluten-free. for example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging. the food industry can use gluten in many products that don't seem like they would contain gluten so it's important to always read the label first. having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well. it may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have. the basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods. the person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet. review this webmd article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes. well she has celiacs disease (non life threatning disease) but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like ( some chex mix cerals corn tortillas some soups any thing that says gluten free on the label

Actual Doctor's Response:
when you enter the part d prescription-drug "doughnut hole " you pay a higher percentage of your drug costs. the doughnut hole starts once you and your plan have paid a total of $2 970 toward your medication costs. this year you do receive a discount of 52. 5% on covered brand-name drugs and 21% off generics until you've reached the end of the coverage gap ($4 750). that's when catastrophic coverage kicks in. you might want to also look into medicare extra help which helps pay drug costs for people with low incomes.

Patient Question:
what's the best skin lightening cream; i am darker skinned?

Actual Doctor's Response:
to brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with. typically that's something called inflammation. that inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin didn't like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan. even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin that's more blotchy or uneven. if you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma. so we use brightening creams to help lighten this. the gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called hydroquinone and this i prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product that's used and how long it's used for. hydroquinones can also be combined with over-the-counter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like niacinamide. and green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin. that's the word i don't like using. these are brighteners and not bleaches.

i suggest that you cleanse your face twice daily with soap and water. pack a pre-moistened cleansing pad if you won't be around a water basin throughout the day. shower or bathe in tepid water rather than steaming hot water. hot water can strip your skin of needed moisture while cold water can shock your skin. avoid using cleansers or toners that tend to over-dry skin or have high alcohol content. this over-drying actually causes your skin to produce even more oil than usual. use only noncomedogenic moisturizers and sunscreen products. this means they're oil-free and won't clog pores. use vitamin a derivatives or retinoids which reduce production in oil glands and shrink their size.

i've had white noise (with corresponding hearing loss) in my left ear for 2 months. what causes it and can it be fixed. i have had an mri -- negative for tumor ms or anything else that might be causing it.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hearing loss would generally be caused by a problem with the ear or a problem with transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. it sounds like you have had tests to detect any brain or nerve problem. i would have to assume at this point you have also seen an ent (ear nose and throat) doctor to have your ear thoroughly examined. sometimes it can be tough to identify the cause of ringing in the ears or white noise-type sounds like you describe with associated hearing loss. the only recommendation i can offer at this point is to work closely with an ent doctor to keep searching for what might be causing it as the list of possibilities is lengthy. based on your symptoms i am not able to tell what might be going on. i am sure you have done quite a bit of research on your own at this point but a search on "hearing loss" on webmd will bring up a host of useful information. to get started here's information on the most common causes of hearing loss. did any doctor call it "tinnitus? " if that's what it is here are some reasons why you might have it that i found. not sure though that this is helpful if you do not have tinnitus. "the most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging (presbycusis) but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises (acoustic trauma). tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. other possible causes of tinnitus include: a buildup of earwax. medicines especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. ear infections or eardrum rupture. dental or other problems affecting the mouth such as temporomandibular (tm) problems. injuries such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. a rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position such as when bicycle riding. blood flow (vascular) problems such as carotid atherosclerosis av malformations and high blood pressure (hypertension). nerve problems (neurologic disorders) such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. other diseases. these may include: acoustic neuroma. anemia. labyrinthitis. meniere's disease. otosclerosis. thyroid disease. most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. you may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms does not get better or go away or is in only one ear. there may not be a cure for tinnitus but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. i also found this article on home treatments: <link>

will running help me lose weight?

Actual Doctor's Response:
running certainly does burn lots of calories and if you're running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if you're putting all that energy into running. but even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldn't lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned. the bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do. running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. however i would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging. start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session. you can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging. eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking. from there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging. a couch to 5k program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging. it’s important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury. if you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight. the extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise.

what we know now is some great studies have been done within the last two years about the relationship between sleep and weight loss and weight gain. there are two hormones in particular that have specific amount to do with appetite. another thing we know about sleep deprivation is that your metabolism slows down. well if you have a slow metabolism you’re not burning fuel efficiently so it’s going into fat storage and fat deposits and again causing more weight gain. we also know with sleep deprivation we have increased levels of cortisol. well that can be another problem which causes more appetite. here’s the most fascinating part about the research i think. all those other things aside when you’re sleep deprived if i was to lay out a healthy snack for you or a very non healthy sugary snack for you you’d gun for the sugary food. you would go for the less healthy food so your food choice is even affected by sleep deprivation. how? they are not 100% sure how but that craving that you’re having seems to be more towards a comfort food which tends to be high carbohydrate high sugar high fat.

early treatment for pneumonia is most effective. see a doctor right away if you think you might have pneumonia. exactly which drug is used to treat pneumonia depends on the type of germ and on your doctor's treatment strategy. in most cases treatment must be continued until most symptoms are gone. this is to be sure that all the germs are killed. full recovery may not occur until after the treatment is completed. antibiotics can cure bacterial pneumonia and make recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia much quicker. antiviral drugs can be used to treat certain types of viral pneumonia but there is not yet any treatment that works against all causes. supportive treatment often helps. this can include medicines that ease chest pain and relieve violent coughing. sometimes oxygen is needed. in all cases a proper diet speeds recovery. young healthy people can feel perfectly fine only a week after recovery from pneumonia. a middle-aged person may not regain full strength for several weeks. in all cases plenty of rest is needed. people generally can return to work as soon as they feel up to it but they will need to take it easy at first.

for years women have tried to accurately determine timing of ovulation in order to conceive or to avoid conception. the interval of maximal fertility begins five (wilcox 1995) to six days (bigelow 2004) before ovulation and declines after ovulation occurs. let’s look at some popular do-it-yourself methods of determining ovulation: calendar basal body temperature charting over-the-counter ovulation predictor kits. calendar charting one’s cycles on a calendar or using a string of colored beads (“cycle beads”) are low-tech methods of attempting to predict one’s “fertile time. ” these methods of ovulation prediction tend to work best in women with very regular cycles between 26-32 days in length. these methods are less exact at identifying the exact occurrence of an ovulation. an improvement in accuracy can be accomplished if the woman is taught to identify changes in cervical secretions (bigelow 2004). the lh surge and spike in estrogen levels precede ovulation by about 16-24 hours. these hormonal peaks create the typical appearance of “fertile mucus” such as clear egg white consistency. however recent intercourse or other sources of increased estrogen [e. g. polycystic ovarian syndrome] can mimic “fertile mucus. ” basal body temperature charts just prior to ovulation there is a modest drop in baseline body temperature. at ovulation and after the temperature rises about a half-degree fahrenheit. that ovulation has occurred is identified after the fact. this is not as helpful for trying to conceive (or prevent conception). it does provide information about when the woman might ovulate in the following months however. ovulation predictor kits perhaps the most reliable method to predict ovulation is to use an over-the-counter ovulation prediction kit (opk). these kits measure the amount of lh in a woman’s urine. when that level peaks one assumes that ovulation will follow within the next 24-36 hours. there have been numerous research studies suggesting that the over the counter opks are very reliable when used according to package directions (eichner 2004). one earlier study of five different opks (ghazeeri 2000) was able to identify an almost two-fold difference in sensitivity between the most and least sensitive kits. this suggests that opk manufacturers should indicate the sensitivity of their product as many home pregnancy tests do. one of the major difficulties with ovulation prediction/documentation is “normal” cycle variations. we suggest to women that it takes about 14 days after ovulation for the menstrual period to appear. this interval is called the luteal phase. yet a variety of studies have demonstrated the length of a luteal phase can range from 10-16 days. even more varied is the interval from the first day of flow to day of ovulation (follicular phase). the mean length of the follicular phase can range from 15-16. 5 days plus/minus 2. 6 to 3. 5 days (fehring 2006). therefore the variability between your cycle and that of your best girlfriend’s is likely to be in the weeks that precede ovulation (follicular phase).

Patient Question:
if i have oral herpes can the girl get it if we have vaginal sex dont kiss or have oral sex but dont use a condom?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think what you're asking is: can you transmit genital herpes to your partner if you have oral herpes but you do not perform oral sex on her. and the answer to that is "no. " you also can't give her oral herpes if you don't kiss her. herpes is transmitted by direct contact. i applaud your concern about not transmitting herpes to your partner. however what concerns me more here is the issue of safe sex in general. how do you know she doesn't have genital herpes that may be transmitted to you? she could have genital herpes and not even know it. or she could be infected with humanpapillomavirus (hpv) and not know it. in fact she could have several sexually transmitted diseases and be unaware of it. why would you take chances with your reproductive health by not practicing safe sex at all times? plus of course there's the issue of pregnancy. do you want to become a father? are you ready to become a dad? because it's possible if you're having unprotected sex. no method of birth control is 100% effective but you can increase the effectiveness of any birth control by using "redundant systems" (to borrow a term from computer science). in other words even if your partner is using some form of birth control you can also use a form of birth control (in this case a condom ) to make sex even safer in terms of pregnancy prevention. again i think you're very wise to be aware that you have oral herpes and to be concerned about not transmitting this virus. i hope you think about the other issues i brought up too.

Patient Question:
how do i prevent baby bottle tooth decay?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the good news is that a few simple steps can help stave off baby bottle tooth decay. they include implementing good oral hygiene at an early age. here's how: wipe the baby's gums with a clean gauze pad or washcloth after each feeding. begin brushing your child's teeth without toothpaste when his or her first tooth comes in. clean and massage gums in areas without teeth. floss once all the baby teeth have come in. make sure your child is getting enough fluoride which helps reduce cavities. if your local water supply does not contain fluoride ask your dentist or doctor how your child should get it. schedule regular dental visits by your child's first birthday. dentists also offer special sealant coatings which can help prevent tooth decay in children. these are expensive however. other techniques to help prevent baby bottle tooth decay include: not filling bottles with sugar water and soft drinks. bottles are for milk water formula and special electrolyte-containing solutions when the child has diarrhea. juices mixed half and half with water to avoid empty calories are a way to interest your child in a "sippy cup. " soft drinks are not recommended for children as they have no nutritional value. never allowing your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing anything but water. never giving your child a pacifier dipped in anything sweet. decreasing your child's sugar intake especially between meals. it's never too late to break bad habits. if your child drinks sweetened liquids from the bottle and/or sleeps with a bottle break the habit now and reduce the risk of baby bottle tooth decay by: gradually diluting the bottle contents with water over two to three weeks. once that period is over fill the bottle with water. remember that healthy baby teeth will lead to healthy permanent teeth.

there are several effective treatments for shingles. drugs that fight viruses (antivirals) such as acyclovir (zovirax) valacyclovir (valtrex) or famciclovir (famvir) can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). in addition to antiviral medications pain medications may be needed for symptom control. both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic pain-control medications may be used for pain management in shingles. the affected area should be kept clean. bathing is permitted and the area can be cleansed with soap and water. cool compresses and anti-itching lotions such as calamine lotion may also provide relief. an aluminum acetate solution (burow's or domeboro solution available at your pharmacy) can be used to help dry up the blisters and oozing. in may 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first vaccine for adult shingles. the vaccine developed by merck laboratories and known as zostavax is approved for use in adults ages 60 and over who have had chickenpox. the shingles vaccine contains a booster dose of the chickenpox vaccine usually given to children. tests over an initial four-year period showed that the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of shingles in these older adults. the single-dose vaccine was shown to be more than 60% effective in reducing shingles symptoms and it reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (phn see above) by at least two-thirds. studies are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine over a longer term. there are certain contraindications to receiving the shingles vaccine. people with weakened immune systems due to immune-suppressing medications cancer treatment hiv disease or organ transplants should not receive the shingles vaccine because it contains live weakened viral particles. there is not enough information available from researchers to decide at this point whether zostavax may be beneficial in people younger than 60 years of age. since the chickenpox vaccine is now recommended for children the incidence of chickenpox has been reduced. this is also expected to reduce the incidence of shingles in adults in the future as these vaccinated children age.

this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain. so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they -- they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list. because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably don't need. i would like to be able to find a more non-drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake. so we want to make sure that that patient understands that. the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need. so that's where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this? this happens all the time in the pharmacy. i can't tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know? well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor doesn't know about this one. everyone needs to know about it. that's why that medication list is so important. not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments. that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use. i also have been on sooo many anti-depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight. i am a 40 year old woman who is 5'1 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds. but i was just prescribed a very new anti-depressant called fetzima there isn't any generic version as of yet. i am on the max dose at 80mg daily. but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting. but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily. the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned. it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain. and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulant/adderall when i have never been add/adhd. i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day. it's hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of "uppers" and then you need "downers". it is crazy. but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds. so over 45 plus pounds in that 3 months. i can't describe the feeling of having absolute no appetite i actually don't eat anything until my 11 year old daughter is home from school then while i am making her a snack and later dinner for the family i try my best to eat a few bites here and there cause i do not want my daughter to think i am trying on purpose to not eat cause i want to be skinny. and so i lose all my weight in my breasts my butt arms and legs and my face is caving in. i will always have a larger stomach after childbirth but if things continue like this i'll end up in the hospital. so please think seriously what is most important as far as getting out of the depression that is so dark been there but if you do end up with weight gain side effect please either eat very healthy and exercise safely and hopefully the depression meds will help enough you will find more days to not just take care of your mental illness but start living healthy and happier. i wish you all the best and know that depression can be just as or more fatal than being a little overweight or very underweight. best wishes malissa

can imodium turn your stool dark?

Actual Doctor's Response:
as a pharmacist if i had a patient who came to me and asked me this question i would actually be a little concerned. i would ask them for how long they have been taking the imodium and when did they notice this change in their stool color. sometimes when we here about dark stools there is a concern that there is some internal bleeding going on. so as a pharmacist my recommendation to this patient would be to stop taking the imodium and get it checked out by a physician or healthcare provider immediately.

Patient Question:
what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
about 20% of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. possible causes of first trimester bleeding include: implantation bleeding. you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus. some women don't realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period. usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days. miscarriage. because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding. about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that doesn't necessarily mean that if you're bleeding you've lost the baby especially if you don't have any other symptoms. other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina. ectopic pregnancy. in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube. if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life-threatening to the mother. although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2% of pregnancies. other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness. molar pregnancy (also called gestational trophoblastic disease). this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby. in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus. additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include: cervical changes. during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix. intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding. this type of bleeding isn't cause for concern. infection. any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection (such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes) can cause bleeding in the first trimester.

i would say stop dieting. trying to stick to ""a diet"" is one of the best ways to set yourself up for failure. instead try eating 5 or 6 times a day meaning 3 healthy meals -- preferably slimmer portions -- with 2 or 3 healthy snacks. when you eat more frequently you'll find you don't have as many cravings. you'll also burn more calories throughout the day. when you eat include a small portion of lean protein (lean meat egg whites beans or low-fat dairy) and a healthy carb (fruits and vegetables or whole wheat bread or pasta) in every meal or snack. protein helps keep you full and carbs provide you energy. don't underestimate the importance of exercise for weight loss. trying to lose weight is a lot easier when you combine eating healthy with exercising. you'll be amazed at how good it makes you feel. also don't let age stop you. if you don't exercise right now check with your doctor first before starting a new routine.

a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the "hyper" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children.

it is definitely possible to get pregnant while on the pill especially if you have only been on it for a couple months (your body may not have absorbed and reacted to the hormones at a "normal" speed) you should take a pregnancy test very soon. if it is negative take one more 1-2 weeks later. if they are both negative it is possible these are just side-effects of how you react to this specific birth control. if it continues to be bothersome or gets worse go to the doctor. have a proffessional pregnancy test done and (asuming it is still negative) discuss changing your contraceptive method.

do cruciferous vegetables have anti-inflammatory benefits?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the cruciferous vegetables — broccoli brussels sprouts bok choy kale cabbage and cauliflower — are “super veggies ” loaded with protective and powerful plant compounds such as sulforaphane. a new study from ucla linked sulforaphane with anti-inflammatory action in the body. sulforaphane stimulates an increase in production of antioxidant enzymes in the nasal airway which work to protect against tissue-damaging free radicals that we breathe in from pollution pollen tobacco etc. when we decrease tissue damage we are decreasing inflammation in the body. this is probably just the beginning of what this phytochemical does for us because sulforaphane appears to increase a whole assortment of antioxidant enzymes in the body — all potentially helping to protect the body. sulforaphane is just one reason to eat your cruciferous vegetables. recent research suggests that the components in these veggies are probably working together. research from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign suggests that one of the phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables crambene is more active when combined with another better-known phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables indole 3-carbinol.

you could ask your doctor for an antiviral but your risk is fairly low. you wouldn't be getting genital herpes anyway - you'd be getting hsv1 that causes cold sores and that's much milder than hsv2 the virus that causes genital herpes. true you can get hsv2 on the mouth and hsv1 on the genitals but in general hsv1 is much milder and less problematic. you probably already have it on your mouth anyway about 80% of the human population have the virus. most of the time it causes no problems.

usually some of the terms and the guidance that i see is that before allergy season some physicians or healthcare providers will start you on singulair maybe a month or two before allergy season hits so it’s in your bloodstream; so it has a constant and steady effect; so therefore by the time allergy season comes it’s working. and how does it work? well typically when you have allergy season your cells are all happy and they’re all behaving. in an allergy attack they all go crazy. what singulair tries to do is it tries to keep them all happy and behaving before it even gets to that point of kind of revolting in a lot of ways. so that makes a lot of sense when i explain that to patients because then they realize that they have to take it every day and that it’s not something that they take at the onset of a sneezing attack or runny eyes or a runny nose. so it could take probably up to 30 days before they’ll notice something. i -- but once again what we’ve learned too is that therapy has to be individualized and how i take something and how you take something might be completely different. a lot of people don’t realize how important it is to take your medicine on a consistent basis. that’s where you really get the value and actually the benefits of the medicine because if it’s only once a day you know it’s not a big deal; but i say to patients i’m like “you know if you skipped five or six days that’s gonna effect how you feel”. and a lot of people don’t put two and two together. so i want to make sure that people understand that there are benefits to taking your medicine every single day.

if he was the only person you have ever had sex with then you most likely got it from him. are you the only person that he has had sex with? if you both have had partners in the past either one of you could have contracted this virus and passed it on.

no. just forgive yourself for a bit of human weakness and keep up your non-smoking efforts. essentially its just the receptors got fed a little bit. it might prolong their death which takes 26 or 28 days. what i'd like to tell you though is that after two weeks the craving only hit you 2-4 times a day and are so short one cup of tea later and they've gone. the other thing is this. get yourself down to a health food shop. they have cigarettes and tobacco with no nicotine. taste like horse hair tbh but are so satisfying and not addictive just for emegencies you know not failure its precaution. you see i was a heavy smoker and my cravings were easily lasting 20 minutes not the 4 minutes promised to me by quit smoking websites! i knew full well i wan't getting a hit from them but they took the craving away. i wasn't crawling the walls at all. in fact the first few days i felt like i was waiting for a craving. lots of folks would say no dont smoke at all. but the fact is once the physical addiction has past (28 days) you don't feel like a herbal. i still take them with me to festivals or big gatherings where i know i'm gonna struggle. if i have one i have one its better than having a real one and thinking you can get away with it. i've quit 5 times in total

what could be wrong with my liver? . i went for an ultrasound earlier this week as i have been having symptoms that have progressed for two months (loss of appetite vomiting diarrhea (sometimes bloody) fatigue abdominal pain and cramping). they found two black spots on my liver and are sending me for more testing (an mri). i heard it could be fatty liver disease; but that usually occurs with the obese and people who drink a lot. . im a 16 year old female. 118 pound; 5'5. i live a very healthy lifestyle (exercising and diet

Actual Doctor's Response:
at 16 years of age or at any age waiting for a diagnosis related to liver symptoms is upsetting and scary. liver disorders can strike at any age and even in people who live a clean and healthy life. your doctor should have explained the possible causes of your symptoms as they relate to the black spots. it is not possible to determine the causes of your liver spots until further testing is completed but the possible significance of the spots could have been discussed. with that said please do not listen to well-meaning individuals suggesting a fatty liver as your problem. for the record most people have some degree of fatty liver. here are my two suspicions regarding your case: inflammation responses; non-cancerous and cancerous tumors (please note that it is unusual to have cancer originating in the liver. known as primary liver cancer). i recommend that you receive more information from your doctor surround yourself with the best and most open medical professionals have as many radiologic tests done as possible help to keep the diagnostic testing moving as swiftly as possible to reduce large gaps of time when you are just waiting and thinking talk about your feelings to family and friends and maintain a positive spirit. i wish you well during this period of medical uncertainty.

here's a longer preview of my question with details: hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 and some days would exercise with my partner for nearly 2 hours almost 2 times a month. i've been working on eating correctly as well (oats fruit no processed foods/sugars). i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 or more glasses of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting heart rate ranges from 74-80 bpm. my problem is during 2 weeks i've been experiencing high pulse rates from (94-104) and on some days a single heart flutter. sometimes during sleeping i wake with strange high pulses. a few days ago i've awaken from a deep dreaming sleep having two heart flutters and freaked out. near the end of the day i get these weird stingy/squeezy chest pains that occur near my left breast very close to the armpit. sometimes i get the same pain at the same spot in my right chest but it's much lighter than the left. my leg elbows of my arms and stomach would also have very mild/light pains that pulsate but disappear after a while. this happens when i'm resting but not when i exercise. they last from 2-20 seconds and disappear or reoccur slightly when in bed. the day before this past halloween i visited a doctor at a clinic and she basically laughed at me saying i was too paranoid and having anxiety. she checked my heart beat and breathing through a stethoscope but no more after that. she said i was too young to be having heart problems. i'm afraid of going back due to spending way too much money just to hear the same reply. this is starting to scare me and i'm very hesitant to return to my regular exercise and weight training since this has been happening. i don't think i have diabetes since i don't get the symptoms (and i'm like a hawk keeping an eye on any similar rising symptoms if i get them). should i continue with my daily activities? how about suggested foods to eat in a single day for healthy heart function? again i don't eat a lot of sugars. thank you.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is no specific home treatment for gallstones but be sure to call your doctor if: you think you have symptoms that may be caused by gallstones. if your doctor finds that you do have gallstones but your symptoms are mild it is generally safe to wait until you have more than one attack before you consider having surgery. you develop symptoms of a gallstone attack again especially if they are severe or occur with fever chills or yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes. you have new belly pain or other belly symptoms. pain in the belly can be a symptom of many health problems. you may be able to help prevent gallstones if: you stay close to a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. you avoid rapid weight loss. intentional weight loss (dieting as opposed to weight loss from illness) followed by weight gain may increase your risk of gallstones especially if you are a woman. if you need to lose weight do so slowly and sensibly. if you have recently had surgery to remove your gallbladder : watch for signs of infection. call your doctor if the area around the incision is red and puffy or if you have a fever. call your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) light-colored stools and dark urine. these symptoms may be signs that gallstones are blocking the common bile duct. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

absolutely. cardio exercise including aerobics is one of the best things you can do to lose belly fat and fat anywhere. strive for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise (aerobics fast walking/jogging elliptical biking etc) at least 5 days per week. on a 10-point scale moderate means you're working at about a level 5 or 6. if you don't have this much time you can pump up the intensity to vigorous exercise and slim down the time to 20 minutes and get the same benefit. vigorous exercise would be a 7 to 8 on a 10-point scale. in fact if you do vigorous exercise 3 days a week should do the trick. of course the more you do the more fat and calories you'll burn. interval training is a great way to get your body used to vigorous exercise. to start do 2 minutes of moderate alternating with 30 seconds of vigorous for 20 minutes. as you get in better shape you can increase the vigorous exercise time. good luck!

Patient Question:
what conditions does lactose intolerance treat?

Actual Doctor's Response:
this product is an enzyme supplement used to help people who have trouble digesting milk and other dairy products (lactose intolerance). lactose is a type of sugar found in milk products. lactase enzyme is normally produced by the body to help break down (digest) lactose. lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces low amounts of lactase enzyme. lactose intolerance can begin at different ages. infants are not usually affected but lactose intolerance can affect children as young as 2. it is very common in adults. one way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid milk products. however this can result in a lack of important nutrients and vitamins such as calcium vitamin d riboflavin and protein. some people use lactose-free milk or milk substitutes such as soy or rice milk. most people with low lactase enzyme levels can tolerate small amounts of milk products at one time (2-4 ounces) and get symptoms only with larger servings (6 ounces or more). taking lactase enzyme with milk products as directed can help prevent upset stomach abdominal bloating/cramping gas and diarrhea caused by these products. the fda has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness. consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9726
lactose is a large sugar molecule that is made up of two smaller sugars glucose and galactose. in order for lactose to be absorbed from the intestine and into the body it must first be split into glucose and galactose. the glucose and galactose are then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine. the enzyme that splits lactose into glucose and galactose is called lactase and it is located on the surface of the cells lining the small intestine. lactose intolerance is caused by reduced or absent activity of lactase that prevents the splitting of lactose (lactase deficiency). lactase deficiency may occur for one of three reasons congenital secondary or developmental. congenital causes of lactose intolerance lactase deficiency may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation in the gene that is responsible for producing lactase. this is a very rare cause of lactase deficiency and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth. secondary causes of lactose intolerance another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase deficiency. this type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small intestine along with the lactase. an example of such a disease is celiac sprue. developmental causes of lactose intolerance the most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood referred to as adult-type hypolactasia. this decrease in lactase is genetically programmed and the prevalence of this type of lactase deficiency in different ethnic groups is highly variable. thus in asian populations it is almost 100% among american indians it is 80% and in blacks it is 70%; however in american caucasians the prevalence of lactase deficiency is only 20%. in addition to variability in the prevalence of lactase deficiency there also is variability in the age at which symptoms of lactose intolerance appear. thus in asian populations the symptoms of lactase deficiency (intolerance) occur around the age of 5 among blacks and mexican-americans by the age of 10 and in the finnish by age 20. it is important to emphasize that lactase deficiency is not the same as lactose intolerance. persons with milder deficiencies of lactase often have no symptoms after the ingestion of milk. for unclear reasons even persons with moderate deficiencies of lactase may not have symptoms. a diagnosis of lactase deficiency is made when the amount of lactase in the intestine is reduced but a diagnosis of lactose intolerance is made only when the reduced amount of lactase causes symptoms.

this is a good question. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is usually caused by a disruption of the balance between "good" bacteria and "bad" bacteria in the vagina. (some people use the terms "good flora" and "bad flora" to refer to bacteria. ) it would seem logical then that taking a supplement to help keep the vaginal flora balanced would keep bacterial vaginosis at bay. the principle is the same as taking a supplement to help keep colon flora balanced in order to avoid symptoms like gas bloating and diarrhea. unfortunately there's little clinical evidence that taking l actobacillus will help with bv. that's because lactobacillus is a bacterium that aids in dairy digestion. this is not a bacterium that normally lives in the vagina. on the other hand one study showed that consuming live lactobacillus acidophilus cultures may reduce the incidence of vaginal yeast infection. with the wide variety of "probiotic" preparations available today if you do decide to try one you should choose one with acidophilus because that bacterium does reside naturally in the vagina. by the way you should not assume you have bacterial vaginosis. the symptoms of bv are very similar to other conditions such as yeast infection or trichomoniasis. if you have vaginal symptoms that don't clear up on their own within a few days your best bet is to see a doctor to get a real diagnosis. these different conditions all require different treatments. hope this helps!

i have pain stiffnes and weakness in hands and fingers. x-ray did not show inflamationn or degnerative arthritis. i am 56 yr old female. my hands and all fingers are very stiff all the time and very painfull when not in use. if i do not keep them moving they become very stiff in a few minutes. i have been taking celebrex which helps but i want to know what is wrong with them. i had carpel tunnel surgery 2 years ago in my left hand and 15 yrs ago in my right. . x-ray taken 2 weeks ago states no inflammatory or degenerative arthritis. will arthritis always show on x-ray? what is my next step?

Actual Doctor's Response:
my arthritis took 5 years before it showed up on an x-ray. my one hand hurt despite no proof and the doctor gave me meloxicam 15 mg tab to take because i also have arthritis in my left knee. (i take it at night only. ) x-rays don't necessarily work to the depth we expect them to in my opinion. but my doctor knows this.

not sure exactly what you have but there are blood tests used to help diagnose arthritis and inflammation. if you haven't had any blood tests done i'd ask your doctor for some.

hi i found you this on the uk's nhs. family planning and pregnancy most medicines in some way can affect the development of a baby in the womb. the effect on the baby differs between medicines and also depends on the stage of pregnancy that you have reached when you take the medicine. in the case of minoxidil: the use of this medicine during pregnancy is not recommended. if you could become pregnant you must use effective contraception or abstain from penetrative sex. you must contact your prescriber if you become pregnant or think you have become pregnant while taking minoxidil if you take this medicine during your pregnancy your baby may have some problems after birth you should discuss your personal circumstances with your doctor if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant. this is so that together you can make a decision about what treatment you may need during your pregnancy. you should discuss whether there are any other medicines which you could take during pregnancy which would treat your condition. do hope its the info your looking for. good luck

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm wondering why you would have your tsh tested twice so close together. usually with hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) it takes weeks of medication therapy to see any change in tsh levels so it doesn't make sense to me your doctor would have you tested just a few days apart. that said while a tsh value of 28 is high it should be fine to wait until thursday to see your doctor. as to why your tsh seems to be going up without you experiencing symptoms well many things can cause this. your doctor will be able to give you some possible reasons for this and (hopefully) get you on a path to better control. best wishes to you! staying at the wrong dosage amount for too long and fluctuate your levels and cause them to change and go from under to over.

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes drinking fluids especially sugar-sweetened or calorie-containing beverages can cause feelings of fullness resulting in decreased food intake. young children with small stomachs are more likely to fill up than older children and adults. it's best to serve calorie-containing beverages with meals. for example juice and milk with lunch or dinner and soda only occasionally. water is the best in between meal beverage. good luck!

" i hope you mean "all over" the baby's bottom. if your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment. with diaper rash prevention is better than treatment. remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments. it's very important that you thoroughly clean and dry your baby's genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change. and never leave your baby "soaking" in wet diapers. change the diapers regularly. instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isn't having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes. wishing you and your baby well!

if the hives don't clear up fairly quickly or if they're accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention. these can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something -- food medication etc. if your wife gets hives occasionally (as some people do) and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then i'd suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives. there are medications other than benadryl that are used to treat hives. in terms of combining antihistamines i'd suggest you speak to a pharmacist. while benadryl (diphenhydramine) has a different chemical composition than zyrtec (cetirizine) they still are both the same class of medication. generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician. i hope that gives you some clarity.

symptoms of osteoarthritis can range from mild to severe. they may include: pain: your joints may ache or the pain may feel burning or sharp. for some people the pain may come and go. constant pain or pain while you sleep may be a sign that your arthritis is getting worse. stiffness: when you have arthritis getting up in the morning can be hard. your joints may feel stiff and creaky for a short time until you get moving. you may also get stiff from sitting. muscle weakness: the muscles around the joint may get weaker. this happens a lot with arthritis in the knee. swelling: arthritis can cause swelling in joints making them feel tender and sore. deformed joints: joints can start to look like they are the wrong shape especially as arthritis gets worse. reduced range of motion and loss of use of the joint: as your arthritis gets worse you may not be able to fully bend flex or extend your joints. or you may not be able to use them at all. cracking and creaking: your joints may make crunching creaking sounds. this creaking may also occur in a normal joint but in most cases it doesn't hurt and doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the joint. arthritis of the spine can also narrow the openings that make space for the spinal cord and for the nerves that branch off the spinal cord ( spinal nerves ). this is called spinal stenosis. it can lead to pressure on the spinal cord or spinal nerves. this pressure can cause pain weakness or numbness. some medical conditions can cause symptoms similar to osteoarthritis. compare osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis. learn about other conditions with symptoms similar to osteoarthritis. one man's story: steve 55 "i thought the stiffness and pain in my hip was just from the stress i was putting on my muscles. but when i changed my exercise routine or stopped working out the pain was still there. the pain would come and go. it wasn't a sharp pain but a kind of ache that would keep me awake a lot. i could never stay in one position for very long.

how is the hepatitis b virus spread (transmitted)?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.

hepatitis a virus is spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth that has been contaminated with the stool of a person with hepatitis a. this type of transmission is called "fecal-oral.

it sounds like you are having symptoms of gerd (or acid reflux disease) with your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is highly unlikely you are having a heart attack. if you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into gerd. i have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with gerd. i find taking an extra strength zantac (150 mg) once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms. if that doesn't help or doesn't help enough you can always speak to your doctor. there are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better.

what is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you. let me give you some background information. the test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone. it has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone. think of it as a bill collector. if you don't respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond. the tsh is the bill collector and if your thyroid "isn't paying the bills" aka isn't producing enough thyroid hormone (t4); tsh levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary (master) gland decides its a hopeless cause and tsh production decreases or stops. the reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their tsh is too high. they don't realize the tsh is not actually the thyroid hormone (which is the hormone that will be low in this case). i just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results. some providers don't realize that if your tsh is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms. thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your tsh down to the lower ranges of normal (0. 7 -2 approximately). . the range used to be 0. 5 to 5 for tsh. the national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 0. 3 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within "normal range". i prefer to keep my tsh around 1 because that's when i feel normal. " everybody is different so that may not work for you. what it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result; if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor. do some research write down questions/symptoms when you think of them and talk to your pcp about it. if you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion.

Patient Question:
how can we treat our 6 month old who has nasal congestion that only seems to bother him at night?

Actual Doctor's Response:
my favorite is using nasal saline drops (with or without the suctioning). the saline helps to loosen up the mucus and promote drainage and the saline also helps to shrink down the nasal passageways -- allowing for more air passage. since it is just salt water you can use it as often as you like and it is pretty inexpensive. .

i will retire this year at 62. my income will drop from $60 000 a year to $22 000. my current employer offers a health insurance plan similar to the silver plan for $150/month. can i save money by opting out of the employer plan and opting into the aca plan? what are my options? also is there a maximum out-of-pocket amount for the aca plans?

Actual Doctor's Response:
while you're still working you won't qualify for a tax credit if the employer's plan is considered affordable under the law. affordable employer health insurance costs no more than 9. 5% of your income and covers at least 60% of covered medical costs. health plans must now limit your annual out-of-pocket costs to $6 350 for an individual and $12 700 for a family. once you retire and are no longer an active employee you can buy a plan through the marketplace. depending on your income you may qualify for a tax credit to buy insurance through the marketplace.

Actual Doctor's Response:
post partum depression like other forms of major depression may last for months or even years if untreated. it is not your fault. eighteen months is too long to have endured those feelings of sadness. certainly with a husband working long hours and not being in an area with close friends and family can also contribute to depression. only a mental health professional trained in depressive disorders can properly diagnosis whether you are experiencing ppd some other form of depression or a combination of these maladies. you may also have a medical condition that results in causing depression as a symptom. i respectively make the following suggestions: 1. ) talk with your husband about your sadness. if he is not approachable then seek the counsel of your physician (this individual can conduct medical testing as well as assess your overall mental state prescribe medication and make mental health referrals) or a minister / priest /rabbi. they can act as a sounding board to express your feelings and offer positive suggestions on restoring joy in your life. 2. ) consider joining a self-help group to support your efforts at regaining purpose in your life. you deserve to feel worthy to have friendships and to feel and give love. through talk therapy and medications the prognosis is encouraging.

yes it is possible that you are suffering at least in part from post partum depression. post partum depression can manifest itself in" just feeling blue and emotionally low" in a modest to moderate way by having frequent mood swings fits of anger and range or in a very severe manner where feelings of harm to yourself or others may exist. just like any major depressive disorder untreated ppd can last for many months or even years. yes having a husband that works long hours and living in a state with no close family or friends is more than likely also contributing to your unhappy feelings. treatment for depressive disorders including ppd involves talk therapy and medication. i would recommend that you first discuss your feelings of sadness with your husband. if for some reason he cannot be available or be supportive your family doctor or a church official may act as a good sounding board to openly express your sad mood. joining a support group may also generate some insight into your depression and provide you with some positive recommendations. only a doctor or highly trained mental health professional can interrupt your negative symptoms and assign a diagnosis. i admire you for taking the first brave step to recovery by honestly acknowledging your feelings and asking for help on this website. eighteen months is a long time to feel sad and to be unmotivated. you are deserving in feeling worthy in having friendships in having a close bond with your child in being loved cared for and appreciated. feeling chronically sad in a clinical manner is not normal. with appropriate treatment unhappiness can effectively be changed to joy.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the key is to get the cause of the weight loss under control which it sounds like have started to do. as for weight gain you need to make food and eating a priority. frequent meals (5-<positive_smiley> may work better especially if you still having nausea. take advantage of the times your appetite is high which for most people with nausea is in the first half of the day. provide yourself with as many food groups as possible when you do eat-- grains protein dairy (or alternative) healthy fats and fruits and vegetables. so instead of just cereal in the morning top it with nuts and fruit and also have a boiled egg. at snack time have full fat yogurt with nuts and graham crackers. make sure you up the fat where you can such as adding a fat source to sandwiches like sliced avocado mayonnaise nut butters or hummus. add full fat dairy products to smoothies and soups and butter or nut butters to toast. protein sources are beneficial such as meats tuna (packed in oil) and beans. with time and vigilance you can get your weight back up. for more tips on healthy ways to gain weight see this webmd article. good luck!

how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear.

Model's Recommendation:

Actual Doctor's Response:
the tetanus vaccine is good for ten years but some medical providers will recommend a booster vaccine sooner than that if there is some doubt as to the previous date or if the wound is particularly prone. the disease tetanus is very rare in the united states (not so rare in other countries) but if you should get it it has an extremely high fatality rate. getting a vaccine every ten years for 100% protection is really the best deal out there in the vaccine world. getting the vaccine 24 hours before a planned injury (? ) is unlikely to be very effective unless of course you have prior immunity from a previous tetanus still on board.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9277
you ask an excellent question. many people think of vaccinations as something only infants receive. but many vaccines require booster shots and mmr (measles mumps rubella) is one of them. the centers for disease control (cdc) advise most adults born after 1957 to receive at least one booster shot of mmr vaccine. having had the vaccine at age 19 kind of puts you in an awkward space between childhood and adulthood. you can get a blood test (called a "titer") to determine if your mmr protection remains strong. this test will look for mmr antibodies in your blood. if the number of antibodies falls below a certain threshold your health care provider may advise you to get another booster shot. if an employer is requiring you to get an mmr booster because you'll be working in a high-risk environment (certain healthcare workers fall into this category for example) you may be able to satisfy their requirements by providing proof of the booster shot you received at age 19 or by getting the mmr titer. receiving an additional dose of mmr vaccine is generally considered safe unless you have a severely compromised immune system (as with hiv/aids) you have cancer or you have certain other medical conditions. webmd offers a great tool for tracking your entire family's immunization records. the webmd vaccines health center not only offers a ton of info on what immunizations you need when but also provides a place to track which vaccines you've received. check it out! wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
the key for growth at this age is looking at her growth over time. has her growth been steady since birth but at lower percentiles or has it dropped recently? red flags for growth are when they cross 2 percentile lines either up or down. also doctors should be using the world health organization growth charts for children under 2. if you pediatrician is using the cdc ones it could give you daughter a lower reading. lastly i highly recommend seeing a pediatric dietitian. he/she can assess what/when/how your child is eating and provide recommendations. typical reasons for groth issues include difficulty transitioning to solid food excessive juice/milk stressful feeding and a low fat/low calorie diet. children under 2 need more fat so that is an important consideration when deciding what foods to offer. also timing and feeding interactions can make a big difference in how well a child eats. you can get a referral through your doctor to a outpatient program at a children's hospital or find a dietitian that specializes in pediatrics by visiting eatright. org. once you get some answers you can rest easy knowing you are doing all you can do.

hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by abnormally low thyroid hormone production. there are many disorders that result in hypothyroidism. these disorders may directly or indirectly involve the thyroid gland. because thyroid hormones affect growth development and many cellular processes inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
hypothyroidism also called underactive thyroid disease is a common disorder. with hypothyroidism your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. the thyroid gland is located in the front lower part of your neck. hormones released by the gland travel through your bloodstream and affect nearly every part of your body from your heart and brain to your muscles and skin. the thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food a process called metabolism. among other things your metabolism affects your body’s temperature your heartbeat and how well you burn calories. if you don't have enough thyroid hormone your body processes slow down. that means your body makes less energy and your metabolism becomes sluggish.

currently taking 75mg of paxil for anxiety. noticing it is not working as well as before. what should i add to it? . i have been on 75mg of paxil cr for three years for treating my panic attacks and general anxiety. it has worked very well. about three weeks ago i started noticing some anxiety creeping back in and i know i'm maxed out on the paxil. should i ask my doctor about adding something like abilify or some other drug to help boost me back to where i was? or should i seek a different ssri altogether? i'm nervous about the latter simply because the paxil has worked so well for so long. thanks!

Actual Doctor's Response:
you are correct in suspecting that the paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions. many of the ssri's including zoloft and prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement. after several years of reliable benefit these ssri's may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms. i would not recommend taking abilify. it has been shown to have many serious side-effects including affecting blood sugar results. while i understand that you do not want to give-up on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine.

the short answer is you should not mix painkillers. you should keep your health care provider informed of your physical status limitations and medication usage. if you and your health care providers can't be partners then you should find another provider. i realize things are never that simple. many things may limit your choice of providers from insurance coverage to the number of providers in your local area. but seriously don't keep important information from your provider. it's not in your best interest. try sitting down and having a good conversation with your provider. tell him or her you can't take dilaudid in the work environment and when you don't take the dilaudid your pain isn't controlled. ask to discuss options: can you combine two different types of pain relievers; can you get some other non-surgical type of treatment; can you get physical therapy? at work find out if you can change anything about your work environment that is aggravating your condition: can you take breaks more frequently on a schedule; can you reduce your work hours temporarily; can you get an ergonomic consultation to arrange your workstation in a way that doesn't irritate your neck? as you can see there are many many ways you can approach this situation without self-medicating. i encourage you to explore better options with your provider. wishing you well!

the treatment of oa focuses on decreasing pain and improving joint movement. the following treatments are available. *over-the-counter pain-relieving medications: these include acetaminophen (tylenol for example) aspirin ibuprofen (advil and motrin) or naproxen (aleve). the antidepressant cymbalta (duloxetine) has been approved for osteoarthritis pain as well. some medications in the form of creams rubs or sprays may be applied over the skin of affected areas to relieve pain. *synvisc synvisc-one supartz and hyalgan: these medications can be given as injections to relieve pain in some people with osteoarthritis. *narcotics: stronger pain pills such as narcotics may be prescribed when osteoarthritis pain is severe and other treatments are not working. *joint protection devices: these can prevent strain or stress on painful joints. *hot or cold compresses: these treatments may be given in the form of a hot shower or bath or by applying heating pads or cold compresses. *surgery: when other treatment options have failed some people may need surgery to relieve chronic pain in damaged joints. * weight control: losing weight can prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints. * exercise: physical activity can improve joint movement and strengthen the muscles that surround the joints. gentle exercises such as swimming or walking on flat surfaces are recommended because they create less stress on joints. activities that increase joint pain (jogging high-impact aerobics etc. ) should be avoided. if you have arthritis talk to your doctor to find out the best exercise routine for you. * alternative therapy: acupuncture and bioelectric therapy may be able to provide some pain relief. some medical research has shown that the supplements glucosamine and chondroitin may relieve some pain in some people with osteoarthritis especially in the knee. some people also use methylsulfonylmethane (msm) for arthritis but there is less evidence showing its benefits. msm is a naturally occurring sulfur that is taken as a dietary supplement.

recently an excellent article appeared in the wall street journal written by medical writer laura landro which provided an excellent summary of the current state-of-the-art treatment for varicose veins. interesting statistics show that over the age of 50 one of two people is affected by veins. apparently there is even a hereditary factor. most varicose veins occur of course on the legs and represent our anatomy’s constant battle with gravity. the traditional means of dealing with varicose veins in the legs has always depended on the size of the veins. for larger veins there was always the classic “ligation and stripping ” which involves several incisions made along the course of the veins and literally pulling the veins out from their beds. but that often left quite a bit of swelling and bruising and took a lot of time to heal and was not really a fabulous procedure. now the so called “endovascular procedures” are performed whereby thin tubes or catheters are placed within the hollow of the veins and either using radio frequency or laser treatments the veins literally become shriveled up. the only way of dealing with smaller varicose veins is to inject them with a solution that again causes such irritation that the veins tend to collapse on themselves and are no longer prominent. that is known as sclerotherapy. typically the medications involved in sclerotherapy are very irritating. even normal saline solution (sterile salt water) can be used. for many years there were just a few medications available. apparently a drug from europe known as polidocanol marketed in the united states as asclera is recommended for the tiniest veins that are known as spider veins. spider veins are known as that because there is usually a feeder central vein from which smaller veins radiate. as the article pointed out when surgery is indicated it is an outpatient procedure done under local anesthesia and perhaps a bit of sedation. remember that it is important to wear compression stockings after these treatments to help reduce the bruising and swelling and hasten healing and resolution.

Patient Question:
i banged my thumb months ago and have had a black bruise under the nail since then. why has this not gotten better?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma -- a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic.

Patient Question:
is it safe to put wart remover on a skin tag

Actual Doctor's Response:
well it may not be dangerous but it won't help either. and you could get a mild skin burn. warts are caused by a virus. warts usually resemble hard rough bumps on the skin. they usually go away on their own after a few months. as you already know you can use an over-the-counter wart remover to help get rid of them faster. skin tags on the other hand are soft floppy growths of excess skin cells. they often occur in areas where clothing rubs the skin or where skin rubs against other skin. for example you might get skin tags around your neck where your shirt collar rubs or you may get skin tags in your groin area where the skin folds rub together. because skin tags are not caused by the virus that causes warts it won't do any good to put wart remover on them. if the skin tags are bothering you you can ask your health care provider to snip them off. it's a simple relatively painless procedure. unless the skin tags are very small you shouldn't try snipping them off yourself because you could experience excessive bleeding or scarring. ask your healthcare provider if it's ok for you to snip off your own skin tags before you attempt it yourself. skin tags can be really annoying! don't feel embarrassed to talk to your healthcare professional about how to get rid of them the next time you have an office visit.

with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!

most helpful answer although age eight is a bit early little girls can start having "breast buds" at that age. at age nine it may be considered normal. there are many factors that could accelerate puberty so it would be wise for your grand-daughter to be properly examined by her pediatrician to make sure that she is not having precocious puberty (early puberty). if she is just developing early there is really nothing that needs to be done in most cases other than careful observation by her medical provider.

Patient Question:
can a viral infection cause knee problems? my boyfriend's knees are stiff and painful. his knee caps are ok. thnak you

Actual Doctor's Response:
a viral infection should not cause knee pain and stiffness. does he have pain in any other joints? if not he should see an ortopaedic md and have it looked at. he should try to excercise as often as he can by walking. he certainly should not try running as running puts a lot of strain on the knees and the joints of the knees. his knee caps may "look" ok but just looking at them isn't enough to tell if he has something more serious possibly needing in the future knee replacement. he should try taking aleve or some otc medication walk as much as he can and consult his physician

Actual Doctor's Response:
unfortunately retiree health insurance plans are exempt from a number of affordable care act provisions including limits on annual and lifetime payouts. unlike with an offer of affordable employee health however as a retiree younger than age 65 you are eligible to shop for coverage through the exchanges set up under the law. and if your income qualifies you may be able to get financial help to lower the cost of your plan. it's worth checking out your options now during open enrollment at healthcare. gov. none of the plans sold there are allowed to impose lifetime or annual limits and they offer a host of other protections your retiree plan may not. you have until february 15 2015 to sign up for a plan for next year.

Actual Doctor's Response:
congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption. you are describing a condition called alcohol withdrawal syndrome. withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently. some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms. around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity. at this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control. some of these symptoms may include: sweating headache vomiting low grade fever black-outs intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others. withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation. in situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method. your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored. based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage i strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination a. s. a. p. to assess your overall health. it is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence. no matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain you're still ahead of where you would have been without stopping. over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better. i applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life. the challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into place. you just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot. if you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot. after years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we don't get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder. best wishes for your continued success.

first let me say that if there was no penetration into your vagina it is unlikely your pregnant. with that being said a boy does not always have to ejaculate for you to become pregnant. often times there is precum which also contains semen and can cause pregnancy if they have penetrated your "hole". peeing would not clean out the semen if there was any in you. the cramps may be caused by menstral cramps or possibly a side effect from the morning after pill. i suggest next time using a condom or other contraceptive if you do not want to get pregnant. please remember that though other contraceptives may prevent pregnancy they may not protect against std's. consult your doctor about the different precautions or options out there if your unsure what to use. if you are still worried about wether or not your pregnant you could try a at home pregnancy pee test stick. good luck.

i'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. burns can be very painful and the healing process can be uncomfortable too. it's important not to scratch or pick at the burn site while it heals because this can lead to scarring. i hope the emergency room gave you some written instructions on how to care for your burn. here is a link to a webmd article about burn care but this mainly refers to mild burns. to your question if the itching is keeping you up at night and assuming you're a healthy individual you can try taking an over-the-counter antihistamine such as benadryl (diphenhydramine). it not only will calm down the itching but will make you feel drowsy. read the label instructions very carefully and take this only as directed. i hope you're receiving follow-up care for your burn. please see your health care provider regularly until it's fully healed. your provider will be able to provide specific instructions on how to care for your burn. feel better soon!

Actual Doctor's Response:
first we have to talk about prevention. we can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock. but you can do things like not smoking. smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible. sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself. skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild. as for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin a is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources. carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks [and] even some green things like spinach and broccoli. collards are a great source of vitamin a. vitamin d -- your skin converts sun into vitamin d but a lot of people have this sun phobia. you can get vitamin d from fortified foods like orange juice and milk. research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin d. vitamin c is critical for wound repair -- for any type of tissue maintenance -- and that applies to your skin. tomatoes citrus kiwi -- they're all great sources. it is not necessary that every formulation gives the same effect just because these are intended for a same purpose. there are some anti-aging cream reviews that can let you know about some effective results these creams are able to produce. click here to know more details anti aging cream click here to know more details ==>> <link> i guess they can help. i am 79 years old and often asked what my secret is. people say i don't look my age. i only have one secret. i don't use any fancy skin creams just a moisturizer because my skin is dry. my secret? smile. especially when you look at yourself in the mirror. give that person the best welcoming smile you can come up with. that is your best friend sometimes your only friend. a smile makes you feel better and look younger. try it. it doesn't cost a thing. smile!

the answer is yes. studies now confirm what we all knew to be true –- prolonged stress does lead to premature and rapid aging of every cell in the body. stress is the ultimate mind-body connection. when we perceive stress our body responds rapidly with a multitude of changes. changes intended to prepare us for the fight or flight response. our heart rate goes up our blood pressure increases blood flow is increased to the brain heart and muscles. protective hormones adrenaline and other chemicals begin surging through the bloodstream nerves begin firing all senses are brought to peak awareness. all this so we are in a state of extreme readiness to take on any threat. this was good hundreds and thousands years ago. what about today? stress is inevitable. with so much stress from work and life that is not a threat to our survival what does all this stress do to our bodies? long term intense stress is not good for the body and accelerates aging. this is especially true if you don’t feel in control over the things that are causing stress. when the stresses do not resolve your immune system is weakened. stressed individuals become ill more frequently. excessive stress actually shortens the life span of the cells throughout the body so that every tissue and organ is ages rapidly. the body begins accumulating highly toxic levels of free radical particles that cause even more oxidative damage to cells and tissues. damage that promotes aging. and because the stress response is so quick to come on and so slow to fade it is likely that those in prolonged high stress occupations like [the united states] president begin to age rapidly –- an aging process we can see over time in their face graying of hair and behavior. the answer? do your best to avoid or reduce excessive and prolonged stress. if that is not possible eat a healthy diet high in anti-oxidant rich foods exercise regularly sleep and laugh. most importantly work to develop stress reduction behaviors and attitudes so that you can better deal with any stresses you experience.

if we're talking about the ear itching then yes that is completely normal. in fact whenever tissue is healing it's normal for it to itch. i won't go into all the dry science behind it but suffice it to say the itching is caused by certain cells that perform a 'clean-up' function in the body. itching is a good sign because it signals the healing process is going as it should. if we're talking about your daughter's body itching or a rash developing then no that is not normal and you should discontinue the antibiotics and call your pediatrician's office. however i think you're referring to the ear itching so i'm going to go with that. i'm sorry your daughter is going through this. make sure to give the entire course of antibiotics even if she starts feeling better. do not save any antibiotics "for future use.

no one can be adequately diagnosed over the internet based solely on a description. you will need to be examined by a medical provider since there can be sooooo many reasons. it is possible that not all of your symptoms are "connected" (a person can have more than one medical issue at the same time). you may need a strep test for your throat. or even a test for mononucleosis but a medical provider would need to make that decision based on your examination findings.

i don't like the idea of "meal replacement" because i think you should eat an actual meal not a bar. but many meal replacement bars are really good choices for taming hunger and giving you the energy you need as a snack. always check the calorie content on the nutrition facts label. a good calorie count for a snack is 150 calories or less. if you are using it to replace a meal make sure the bar contains a decent amount of protein -- at least 10 grams.

Patient Question:
can i stop taking flomax once i have passed the kidney stone? . i am a generally healthy 52 year old female. last week i was diagnosed with a 5mm kidney stone and was prescribed flomax to help pass the stone. i passed it about three days later and now i am wondering if i can stop taking flomax. the urologist said i would have to take it for a month then have a follow up ultrasound to make sure i don't have hydronephrosis. i find the side effects i'm experiencing (headaches stuffy nose and nose bleed) very annoying.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i definitely would not stop taking the fosamax without first talking to your doctor. you don't want to risk having more problems with kidney stones. the side effects you list are not commonly associated with fosamax. of course everyone is different and it's possible that they're associated with the medicine but it could also be something else. there are also other medications similiar to fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very uncomfortable. it's true that antibiotics continue working for some time after you take the last dose. the length of time they keep working depends on the exact type of antibiotic. however at five weeks post-antibiotics you can rest assured they have long since exited your system. and it's very good news that a chest x-ray showed your lungs are clear of fluid. as you probably know pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. this is usually caused by a virus though it can also be caused by bacteria. the problem with either type of pneumonia is that it inflames and irritates your delicate lung tissue. and this irritation can linger even after the infection is gone. this probably explains why you continue to feel symptoms even though you no longer have pneumonia per se. i would suggest you continue to follow up regularly with the doctor who treated you. he or she should be able to better explain the factors that may be continuing to cause you discomfort. you deserve an explanation and your doctor is the person in the best position to tell you. wishing you well!

sex during pregnancy is likely to feel different -- and may need more creativity than usual to feel good. some women find their desire waning. others feel more deeply connected to their sexuality and more aroused. over the 40 weeks of pregnancy it's normal for sexual desire to come and go as your body changes. you may feel self-conscious as your belly grows. or you may feel sexier with larger fuller breasts. open communication with your partner is key. you may need to play with positions especially later in pregnancy to find one that's both comfortable and stimulating for you.

what can cause an infant boys scrotum to swell? . my 10 month old son has developed an almond sized lump in his scrotal sac over the last two days. it has grown somewhat over the last 24 hours. it has not changed in color or shape just size. i can see his testicles and the lump is higher up in the scrotum right under his penis and a little to the left. i think it may be an inguinal hernia but am wondering if it could possibly be something else. anyone have an instances of this?

Actual Doctor's Response:
his pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him. it is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description. yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele. a torsion (twisting) is also possible but these are very painful and quite serious. i suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly "de-torse" in some children. either way an examine will be required to make that important determination. if he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis.

Patient Question:
how effective are allergy shots for asthma sufferers?

Actual Doctor's Response:
for people with allergic asthma allergy shots (immunotherapy) can be effective at reducing allergic triggers to asthma. an allergist would evaluate to determine if he/she thinks you would benefit from allergy shots. asthma should be controlled as best as possible with medications before starting allergy shots. . because you are being injected with things you are allergic to there is a risk of having an allergic reaction. most patients do not have any side effects and those that experience side effects typically have localized itching and swelling at the injection side. in very rare cases people experience severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. most cases of anaphylaxis happen shortly after the allergy shots are given that is why you are required to be monitored in the clinic for a period of time. the allergy office is prepared with the needed medications to treat patients with severe reactions. the risk of a fatal reaction is extremely small but there have been a few cases of patients having fatal reactions. because of this it will be important that you understand the protocol and instructions for the allergy shots. there are many safety procedures in place to prevent serious reactions. if you have any questions about the protocol or risk you should thoroughly discuss with your allergist before starting.

asthma in children can often be diagnosed based on medical history symptoms and a physical exam. keep in mind that oftentimes when you take your infant or older child to the doctor with asthma symptoms the symptoms may be gone by the time the doctor evaluates the child. that’s why parents are key in helping the doctor understand the child’s signs and symptoms of asthma. medical history and asthma symptom description: your child's doctor will be interested in any history of breathing problems you or your child may have had as well as a family history of asthma allergies a skin condition called eczema or other lung disease. it is important that you describe your child's symptoms -- cough wheezing shortness of breath chest pain or tightness -- in detail including when and how often these symptoms have been occurring. physical exam: during the physical examination the doctor will listen to your child's heart and lungs and look for signs of an allergic nose or eyes. tests: many children will also have a chest x-ray and for those ages 6 and older a simple lung function test called spirometry. spirometry measures the amount of air in the lungs and how fast it can be exhaled. the results help the doctor determine how severe the asthma is. other tests may also be ordered to help identify particular " asthma triggers " for your child's asthma. these tests may include allergy skin testing blood tests (ige or rast) and x-rays to determine if sinus infections or gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) are complicating asthma. learn more about diagnosing asthma. a new asthma test that measures the amount of nitric oxide in the breath (eno) may now be available in your community.

there is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair. if those hair follicles were not present when you were born you can't grow new ones. it is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get. i don't think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine. testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help. your first step is to see a dermatologist.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi this bit below is from webmd so show her this it may help both of you. sometimes you may notice that your menstrual blood becomes dark brown or almost black as you near the end of your period. this is a normal colour change. it happens when the blood is older and not being expelled from the body quickly. temporary thick heavy flow isn't necessarily cause for concern. however regular heavy periods justify a trip to the doctor to check your blood counts. many women become accustomed to heavy periods considering them to be normal. over time though the excess monthly blood loss leads to anemia potentially causing weakness or fatigue. if you ever feel something's not right with your period see your health care provider. as for the pains could be just cramping has she had anything like this before? do hope this helps you. good luck

i'm sorry your daughter went through this. i hope she has been successfully treated for her anorexia and bulimia. the symptoms you describe could be caused by many things and only a health care professional can tell for sure what caused this episode. however if indeed this was an isolated incident one likely cause of these symptoms is low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ). if a person doesn't eat regularly or if they work too hard and neglect their health overall their blood sugar can drop and cause precisely the symptoms you describe. in a case like that giving sugar is the best remedy. crackers would do the trick because the carbohydrates would quickly be converted to simple sugars. if the crackers and water made your daughter feel better chances are good this was just an episode of hypoglycemia. your daughter can avoid future episodes by taking care of herself including eating quality foods on a regular schedule drinking plenty of water and exercising. with her history of anorexia and bulimia it's important she maintains healthy non-compulsive eating and exercise habits. if she needs help with this she should see a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. often these services are available on a sliding fee scale. i want to emphasize i'm only speculating about one possible cause for your daughter's episode. getting to the root cause of what happened requires a physical exam and some blood testing. your daughter needs to find a way to obtain medical care not only because of what happened with the fainting but to help manage her health eating disorders anxiety and tobacco use. wishing you all well!

believe it or not aloe is a popular product that's available on all the shelves but there is no evidence that it actually works in helping sunburns. so this is actually a good question. burow's solution is usually used for poison ivy. it helps relieve the itching not necessarily redness or inflammation. so the rule of thumb is if you have sunburn what you want to do is definitely use cool compresses or sit in like a cool tub filled for about 15-20 minutes. you can take things like tylenol or advil to help alleviate any type of pain. but if the sunburn is really bad and you start breaking out in blisters you need to see a medical professional for additional prescription products and also just to be evaluated to make sure you didn't do any additional damage to the skin.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the brain. there really is no one organ that controls blood pressure. blood pressure is controlled through how much blood goes through your heart and a delicate body balance achieved through the cardiovascular central nervous and urinary systems. neurotransmitters in the brain signal the heart to beat quicker and increase blood pressure when it becomes too low. the change in your heart beating then changes the volume and force of blood going through the kidneys and the sodium balance. this action further impacts the fluid in your blood vessels and either lowers or increases your blood pressure.

i'm sorry to hear your husband's going through this. it sure doesn't sound like much fun! obviously i'm not a dentist so my experience with dental issues is somewhat limited. i do think it would be odd not to treat a bona fide abscess (which is an infection) with antibiotics but maybe this is a legitimate dental protocol. i really don't know for sure. if i were in your shoes i would take my husband's temperature every four hours with a thermometer (none of this hand-to-the-forehead stuff or "you look feverish"). get a good thermometer and take his temperature. if he's running a fever it's time for a trip to urgent care. fever often is a sign of infection. for the bleeding one thing your husband can try is biting down firmly (but not real real hard) on a damp teabag (or damp gauze) for about 5 minutes. then gently remove it and see if the major bleeding has stopped. if not try with a fresh tea bag. a clot should form in the socket where the tooth was removed. if this doesn't happen a painful condition called " dry socket " can occur. extracting a wisdom tooth can be very painful. if the dentist did not prescribe a pain reliever your husband's in a tough spot. if he's been taking ibuprofen (motrin) or aspirin this could be why he's still bleeding. he could take acetaminophen (tylenol) if he's not allergic to it. this might help control the pain. in any case if you have serious concerns about the situation either call the dentist or go to urgent care. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
has anyone experienced strong vaginal odor while going through menopause?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the most common cause of bad odor coming from the vagina is a condition called bacterial vaginosis also called gardnerella. the odor stems from an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that causes a strong fishy odor. the odor is worse after intercourse because the ph of the semen causes more of the odor to be released. prescription pills or cream can usually eliminate the bacterial imbalance. in premenopausal women a not uncommon cause of bad odor is a forgotten tampon. removal of the tampon will correct the problem. gentle cleansing of the vulva with clean water is usually sufficient for hygiene. any soap can be irritating to the vulva and in some cases can cause dermatitis skin irritation or rash. in most cases douching is not recommended. a very strong or unusual odor should be evaluated by a clinician. yes; i was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop- just kind of cold turkey. i had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came. my general health care provider could not help me. i found a gynocologist who would see me.

anytime that you have unprotected intercourse with a woman she has the potential of getting pregnant. if this was not your intention then why in the world did you have unprotected sex? the human body is designed to concieve; not designed to prevent it. whether your sexual partner is pregnant or not and you are the father you would have to see some proof or confirmation. if she is having unprotected sex with others then she may have already been pregnant. if you are not interested in getting these sort of calls use a condom! it is not rocket science: when a few million sperm and a lonely ova meet pregnancy is always a possibility so do you part. always.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you don't have appendicitis because appendicitis is not a come and go pain. appendicitis is extremely painful. the thing you have is actually caused by extra fluid form your system being trapped in your air vent. but if you are trying to become pregnant do not put too much pressure on yourself. that is probably why you have abdomen pain. and you can also take women pills for pregnancy. that wont really make you pregnant but it will prepare your body for pregnancy. you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have abdomen pain and you think it is from your ovaries.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have the exact same symptoms. they come and go in intensity but i am getting it very often these days. i think it is because our nerves are irritated from being damaged. my theory is that it is herpes as that virus lives in nerve cluster behind the ear. and the herpes zooster and many viruses reside in nerves and herpes kills nerve cells causing them to become irritated leading to a burning sensation. this is why so many people have this problem but have no clue what is the reason most people have no idea they have herpes. it is most likely to be triggered by a number of reasons. but being fit keeping your immune system healthy and eating foods that don't trigger the virus should greatly help possibly keep it completely at bay.

Patient Question:
what is the recovery period for bilateral knee replacement?

Actual Doctor's Response:
recovery from bilateral total knee arthroplasty can be very challenging. those individuals that have gone through it can confirm it first hand. like all things in medicine some people will recover quicker than others. in our practice most people that undergo bilateral tka [total knee arthroplasty] spend some period of time in a rehabilitation center after leaving the inpatient setting. i like to think that people are about 75% recovered at 6 weeks but it often seems like people make continued recovery all the way out to one year following surgery. this seems to hold relatively true for patients following single tka and therefore you can imagine that the recovery process could be even longer and more challenging when both are done at the same time. if you feel like you are making progress each day or week or even each month then you are probably headed to a good long term result. there are certainly times that patients will get discouraged by the challenge of recovery but remember that the overwhelming majority of patients that have the operation experience improvement in pain function and quality of life.

hi my mother 85 y suffer from lumber. s. s she need exercise for her knee kindly advise since she stand (with walker)

Actual Doctor's Response:
your mother can definitely increase the strength of the muscles that surround and support the knee. the good thing is it doesn't take hours and all of them can be performed at home. 1. sit to stands starting position: sitting with both feet flat and her walker in front of her exercise: slowly and with control come to a standing position finish position: slowly and with control return to the seated position important safety and progression points 1. in the beginning let her use both arms to push up. 2. as she gets stronger and can perform 10 repetitions with little effort have her only use one arm to push up. after that progress to using no arm movement to come to standing 3. once that becomes easy switch chairs. chairs that are lower to the ground are much more difficult to get out off. however when you do this allow her to push off with both arms and progress her through just like you did before. 4. also if loss of balance or dizziness upon standing is a problem make sure someone is standing next to her when she's performing this exercise. 5. start slowly begin with just 3 repetitions and progress to 10. 2. knee extension starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat and a leg weight attached to the ankle exercise: slowly and with control straighten the leg like you were going to kick a ball finish position: slowly lower to the floor and repeat for a total of 10 times. switch the ankle weight to the other side and repeat important safety and progression points 1. with this one its better to start off with a very light weight and progress as needed as sometimes it can bother the knee. 3. hip flexion: starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat on the floor and the leg weight from the previous exercise lying on the thigh exercise: lift the leg up towards you keeping the knee bent. slowly lower and repeat for a total of 10. switch the weight to the other side and repeat just performing 1 set of 10 repetitions of each of these exercises can make a big difference in her strength and mobility. however it's important that as she gets stronger that you increase the resistance (lower chair or a heavier weight). these exercises should challenge her but not exhaust her. the key is to start small and build from there. as with any new exercise program make sure its ok with her doctor before beginning

Actual Doctor's Response:
it would be highly unlikely for xanax to remain in the system after a week. it clears very fast. the real question may be "why did he take xanax? ". many will take this sedative to come down from a different drug that makes them high like methamphetamines. it would not be a waste of money to drug-test your son if you suspect drug use but one negative test does not vindicate him. you may have to randomly test him from time to time to be sure. and make sure he is observed getting the specimen. many teens have some tricks.

anytime that you have unprotected sex and are not using any form of contraception you are at risk to getting pregnant. why did you have sex with your boyfriend without a condom? had he worn one you would not be freaking out right now. if you start showing any signs of pregnancy you will need to do a home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an examination.

Patient Question:
what tests are done to determine the cause of male infertility?

Actual Doctor's Response:
identifying the cause of a man's infertility is as much an art as a science. “the first step is an evaluation by a physician specializing in male infertility ” says stephen shaban md a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and microsurgery in raleigh north carolina. experts differ in their approach but here are some of the tests you can expect: sperm and semen analysis. they provide a private room (and magazines). you provide a fresh sample of semen. experts then assess your sperm count their shape movement and other variables. “generally a higher number of normal-shaped sperm means higher fertility ” says shaban. but exceptions are common. many men with low sperm counts or abnormal semen are still fertile. and about 15% of infertile men have normal semen and plenty of normal sperm. surprisingly the complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia) can be a good thing. lawrence ross md president of the american urological association says it might suggest a blockage in the “plumbing” that can be corrected with surgery. physical examination. a thorough physical exam can detect varicocele and give clues to hormone problems. this should ideally be performed by a urologist. hormone evaluation. testosterone and multiple hormones made in the brain control sperm production. however hormones are not the main problem in 97% of infertile men. testicular biopsy. this is done for men with very low or no sperm in their semen. a needle biopsy of the testicle can show whether a man is making healthy sperm. if abundant good sperm are found in the testicle there's likely a blockage somewhere. genetic testing. genetic tests can identify specific obstacles to fertility and problems with sperm. experts differ as to when genetic tests should be done.

infertility in men is most often caused by: problems making sperm -- producing too few sperm or none at all problems with the sperm's ability to reach the egg and fertilize it -- abnormal sperm shape or structure prevent it from moving correctly sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. for example cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer hi this piece below has come from this site below <link> healthy bowel habits for children regular bowel movements are important to your child’s health. bowel habits—how often how much and so on—will vary from child to child. some children go more than once a day while others may skip a day or two. you can encourage healthy bowel habits by: eating healthy foods — whole grains fruits and vegetables — and drinking more water each day. children should have no more than 120 ml of 100% fruit juice per day. staying active throughout the day. this will help keep bowels working well. teaching your child not to hold a bowel movement. explaining that regular bowel movements are normal and important for good health. not using negative words like “dirty” or “stinky ” because they can make your child feel self-conscious about going to the toilet. the most common problems with bowel movements are constipation and diarrhea. look as long as it not in his pants i would not worry to much my son done much the same he normally went just as his meal was being put on the table to be honest never gave it a thought do you think your over reacting? fo me its just healthy bowels. good luck

what causes pain nausea and blockage in the colon/abdomen? . i know a college aged person who has been suffering from pain and nausea. the doctors mentioned "appendigitis" (not appendicitis). she was hospitalized for days but then seemed to get better. however she is now having the same symptoms again. she is going to have exploratory surgery. she had a recent colonoscopy which showed no problem. have you heard of appendigitis? no one in the medical profession that i know seems to know what it is. in fact they have never heard of it!

Actual Doctor's Response:
appendagitis is basically where fleshy finger shaped growths on the outside of the large intestines called appendages get infected or inflamed. these appendages aren't entirely understood. they may serve as padding in the abdominal cavity but when they are inflamed they can cause trouble. appendagitis is a legitimate medical condition but a gi doctor is more likely to know what it is. the exploratory surgery is probably to find out the size and location of these appendages and possibly to remove them. the colonoscopy could come out normal looking because the appendages are on the outside of the large intestine not the inside. as for your friend's symptoms they all lead to each other. appendagitis could cause all the things you mention.

Actual Doctor's Response:
congestive heart failure

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
congestive heart failure (chf) is a condition in which the heart's function as a pump is inadequate to deliver oxygen rich blood to the body. congestive heart failure can be caused by: diseases that weaken the heart muscle diseases that cause stiffening of the heart muscles diseases that increase oxygen demand by the body tissue beyond the capability of the heart to deliver adequate oxygen-rich blood the heart has two atria (right atrium and left atrium) that make up the upper chambers of the heart and two ventricles (left ventricle and right ventricle) that make up the lower chambers of the heart. the ventricles are muscular chambers that pump blood when the muscles contract. the contraction of the ventricle muscles is called systole. many diseases can impair the pumping action of the ventricles. for example the muscles of the ventricles can be weakened by heart attacks or infections (myocarditis). the diminished pumping ability of the ventricles due to muscle weakening is called systolic dysfunction. after each ventricular contraction (systole) the ventricle muscles need to relax to allow blood from the atria to fill the ventricles. this relaxation of the ventricles is called diastole. diseases such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) or amyloidosis can cause stiffening of the heart muscle and impair the ventricles' capacity to relax and fill; this is referred to as diastolic dysfunction. the most common cause of this is longstanding high blood pressure resulting in a thickened (hypertrophied) heart. additionally in some patients although the pumping action and filling capacity of the heart may be normal abnormally high oxygen demand by the body's tissues (for example with hyperthyroidism or anemia) may make it difficult for the heart to supply an adequate blood flow (called high output heart failure). in some individuals one or more of these factors can be present to cause congestive heart failure. the remainder of this article will focus primarily on congestive heart failure that is due to heart muscle weakness systolic dysfunction. congestive heart failure can affect many organs of the body. for example: the weakened heart muscles may not be able to supply enough blood to the kidneys which then begin to lose their normal ability to excrete salt (sodium) and water. this diminished kidney function can cause the body to retain more fluid. the lungs may become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) and the person's ability to exercise is decreased. fluid may likewise accumulate in the liver thereby impairing its ability to rid the body of toxins and produce essential proteins. the intestines may become less efficient in absorbing nutrients and medicines. fluid also may accumulate in the extremities resulting in edema (swelling) of the ankles and feet. eventually untreated worsening congestive heart failure will affect virtually every organ in the body.

malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite plasmodium which infects red blood cells. malaria is characterized by cycles of chills fever pain and sweating. historical records suggest malaria has infected humans since the beginning of mankind. the name "mal aria" (meaning "bad air" in italian) was first used in english in 1740 by h. walpole when describing the disease. the term was shortened to "malaria" in the 20th century. c. laveran in 1880 was the first to identify the parasites in human blood. in 1889 r. ross discovered that mosquitoes transmitted malaria. of the four common species that cause malaria the most serious type is plasmodium falciparum malaria. it can be life-threatening. however another relatively new species plasmodium knowlesi is also a dangerous species that is typically found only in long-tailed and pigtail macaque monkeys. like p. falciparum p. knowlesi may be deadly to anyone infected. the other three common species of malaria ( p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale ) are generally less serious and are usually not life-threatening. it is possible to be infected with more than one species of plasmodium at the same time. currently about 2 million deaths per year worldwide are due to plasmodium infections. the majority occur in children under 5 years of age in sub-saharan african countries. there are about 400 million new cases per year worldwide. most people diagnosed in the u. s. obtained their infection outside of the country usually while living or traveling through an area where malaria is endemic.

Actual Doctor's Response:
gotta love a person who admits she has a "short fuse and a hot temper"! i'd suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination. when you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs. this symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a check-up. it might just be that you need to cut back on salt. but it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems (besides your mitral valve regurgitation). it wouldn't be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart you've caught it early. wishing you (and your temper) all the best! sounds like fluid retention. i have the samething all the time nearly.

these specially formulated multivitamins are designed to ensure pregnant women get all the extra vitamins and minerals essential for the development of a healthy baby and to meet the increased nutritional needs of mom too. they also benefit women who are trying to become pregnant and new mothers who are breastfeeding. specifically prenatal vitamins deliver a bigger boost of folic acid (between 800 and 1 000 micrograms a day much more than the 400 micrograms a day needed by women of childbearing age) to help prevent neural tube defects and increased iron which helps ward off anemia. they also contain amounts of other vitamins and minerals—including niacin riboflavin thiamin and vitamin c—that may be dangerous. for example vitamins a and d can be harmful when taken in too-large quantities. the rest of us should focus on getting all our nutrients from a rich and varied diet. if you want to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet take a once-daily multivitamin formulated for your age group.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think what you're experiencing is indeed normal. at least if it's absent other signs or symptoms such as a fever. you don't say if you're experiencing pain at the incision sites or in the area where your appendix used to be. either way it's possible some of this pain is due to the development of scar tissue. scar tissue will form wherever healthy tissue was cut. scar tissue is kind of fibrous and can contract which could give you that pain you're experiencing when you try to stretch. the good news is the pain probably will go away eventually. if it's caused by scar tissue this may relax or break down so it's not so tight. if the pain is caused by general post-surgical tissue inflammation that also should calm down as the tissue fully repairs itself. if you experience a fever or any systemic symptoms you should seek medical attention. but if you're just experiencing minor pain you might give it awhile and see if this improves. if not by all means revisit your doctor. wishing you well!

so sorry you're experiencing this. a person thinks surgery is going to get rid of the pain and then. nope! one question i would have is: how long ago was your gallbladder surgery? i mean you can experience post-surgical pain in that area for several weeks post-op. if you had the surgery just recently i'd say give it some more time for things to heal inside. if your surgery was some time ago then i would say go back to your doctor. not the surgeon but your primary care provider. tell him or her what's going on. although your gallbladder clearly needed to come out there may be another problem going on that needs to be diagnosed. perhaps your liver is inflamed or something. it's not uncommon for the resolution of one health problem to reveal another. removing your gallbladder may have exposed another health issue that was going undetected because of the gallstone problem. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
are there any repellants for bedbugs?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is nothing that you can get or spray that will actually repel or make a bedbug decide to stay away from you. you will be far more sucessful in evading bites however if you understand their weakness. bedbugs can not climb slippery surfaces and heat will kill them. you can take advantage of this by applying a lubricant to the legs of your bed or any surface they might climb to get into your bed. also for this to be effective you will have to make sure that there are no bugs currently in your bed. take your pillows blankets bed linins and anything else that is in your bed and dry them on high heat for 45 min or more. then take apart your bed and use a hot steam gun on every crack crevis anywhere you see black dots or clusters of dots (those are bedbug eggs) deep steam every square inch of your mattress and box spring and make sure you hit the crevices and seams real good. then buy a cover that is rated for bed bugs and seal your mattress in that cover to make sure anything that you might of missed can not get out to bite you. dry your bed linings blankets sheets and pillows every day. alochol can kill bed bugs on contact however it will not kill eggs. ultimately you want to eliminate the bed bugs all together it's a considerable amount of work to do this. if you have a place you can stay for at least 3 weeks you can use vapor strips to kill them. close your windows and seal your vents with plastic open anything that is sealed (plastic totes bags of clothes anything that isin't food in your kitchen). the vapor needs to be able to reach everything. then you want to buy vapor strips called nuvua strips that emit a vapor that fills the house and is toxic to bed bugs. open the strips and distribute them through the rooms in your house (make sure you buy enough for adaquate coverage). make sure your heating or air is turned off as well. anything you take with you to the place your staying must be dried in a dryer for 45 min on high heat so you don't contaminate the new place. other objects that you bring should be kept to a minimum as well. dishes or anything you know for sure is bug free is fine to take with you. when you come back 3 weeks later (3 weeks is to make sure any eggs hatch and are killed by the vapor). open the house to let it air out unseal and turn on your air and you should be bug free. however you will want to at this point take all of your laundry to a laundry mat and at least dry everything for good effect. i dealt with bedbugs for a year and a half and they do require drastic measures to eliminate. you won't be able to just spray something and be done with it. if you don't have a place to stay for 3 weeks you can consult an exterminator. we had to go this option. we had to put all of our belongings in a bedroom the exterminator put the vapor strips in that room and sealed it up with plastic to keep the vapor in. then every week for a month he would come a visit with and spray a chemical all over the furniture and the floors that killed anything that was living there. we had to wash and dry all of our laundry put a cover on our mattress and dry our blankets pillows and bed linings every night. also he put a powder called dichatomaus earth (i may of misspelled that) on all the cracks and corners of our house. this powder actually cuts the shell of the bedbug on contact and they will die. at the end of the month of treatments we were able to open the sealed off room and finally return our lives to normal. total cost was about 800. 00 with the exterminator. if we had went with the strip method it would of been closer to 400 or so. i hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck.

yes you have gum disease! healthy gums do not bleed. if your gums are healthy you should be able to brush and floss without any pain or bleeding. mouthwashes are useless if your brushing and flossing are not effective. i cannot answer to your dentist's diagnostic and communication skills however i do recommend that you go and seek the advise of a periodontist. go in for a consult and have the periodontist examine your mouth review your home care and see why you are constantly bleeding. i do not know if you are taking any medication which might create this situation or your brushing technique is lacking but this should be reviewed by the most trained person. please do not delay this. gingivitis (gum disease) is entirely reversible if addressed in time.

how can malaria be prevented?

Actual Doctor's Response:
prevention of malaria involves protecting yourself against mosquito bites and taking antimalarial medicines. but public health officials strongly recommend that young children and pregnant women avoid traveling to areas where malaria is common. the most current information about malaria is available from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the world health organization (who). if you are planning international travel you can learn about the risk of malaria in that geographic area and the medicines recommended to prevent infection by contacting: the cdc at its toll-free phone number (1-800-232-4636) or web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm). your doctor or local health department. prevent mosquito bites to prevent mosquito bites follow these guidelines: limit your outdoor activity between dusk and dawn. stay in screened or air-conditioned rooms. wear protective clothing (long pants and long-sleeved shirts). use insect repellent with deet (n n diethylmetatoluamide). the repellent is available in varying strengths up to 100%. in young children use a preparation containing less than 24% strength because too much of the chemical can be absorbed through the skin. use bed nets (mosquito netting) sprayed with or soaked in an insecticide such as permethrin or deltamethrin. use flying-insect spray indoors around sleeping areas. avoid areas where malaria and mosquitoes are present if you are at higher risk (for example if you are pregnant very young or very old). if you use a bed net treated with insecticide and use insect repellents on your clothes you will reduce your risk of becoming infected with malaria. other steps that may be helpful in reducing the risk of malaria include using air conditioning and electric fans wearing protective clothing using aerosol insecticides in your house and taking certain antimalarial medicines. 3 medicines to prevent malaria the selection of medicines to prevent malaria depends on the geographic region where you may be exposed to malaria and your health condition (such as being pregnant being elderly or young being sick or having immunity or resistance to malaria or having allergies or sensitivity to the medicine). if you are going to a location where malaria is present it is very important to take preventive medicines and to follow the correct schedule for taking them. the majority of people who become infected with malaria do not take preventive malaria medicines or do not follow the correct dosing schedule. medicine to prevent malaria is most effective if you take the recommended dosage exactly as prescribed and for the length of time required. if you are to take the medicine once a week take it on the same day of the week each week. upon returning from an area where malaria is present continue the medicine for the recommended length of time to ensure that all parasites have been eliminated from your body. you will need to take the medicine for 1 to 4 weeks after returning. malaria vaccines scientists are studying malaria vaccines to see whether the vaccines are effectively preventing malaria infection. to date there is no strong evidence that these vaccines are effective. 4 3 work continues on improving vaccines for preventing malaria. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis c but you can reduce your risk of becoming infected if: you do not share needles to inject drugs. if you are injecting drugs the best way to protect yourself is by not sharing needles or other equipment (such as cotton spoons and water) with others. many cities have needle exchange programs that provide free sterile needles so that you do not have to share needles. if you want to stop using drugs ask your doctor or someone you trust to help you find out about drug treatment programs. you work in a health care setting and you follow your institution's safety guidelines. you wear protective gloves and clothing and dispose of needles and other contaminated sharp objects properly. you make sure the practitioner sterilizes the instruments and supplies if you get a tattoo have your body pierced or have acupuncture. if you have hepatitis c you can help prevent spreading it to others if: you do not share needles or other equipment such as cotton spoons and water if you continue to use needles to inject drugs. you keep cuts scrapes and blisters covered to prevent others from coming in contact with your blood and other body fluids. throw out any blood-soaked items such as used band- aids. you do not donate blood or sperm. you wash your hands-and any object that has come in contact with your blood-thoroughly with water and soap. you do not share your toothbrush razor nail clippers diabetes supplies or anything else that might have your blood on it. breast-feeding mothers who have hepatitis c can continue to breast-feed their babies because hepatitis c cannot be spread through breast milk. if you are breast-feeding you should try to avoid having cracked nipples which might pose a risk of spreading the virus to your baby. for more information see the topic breast-feeding. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i am a 57 yr old woman. is there anything wrong with getting up to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most adults shouldn’t have to get up more than once a night to urinate. having to get up 2 or 3 times is likely causing you to lose a lot of sleep. for a woman who has already gone through menopause the most common causes of frequent nighttime urination include diabetes and bladder infections. diabetes is often silent and frequent urination may be the only sign that the blood sugar is too high. with a bladder infection you might have other symptoms such as urgency and discomfort. there are also many other possible causes of nightly bathroom trips. it may be as simple as drinking too much fluid in the evening. overactive bladder is another common cause. medicines such as water pills may make you run to the bathroom even if they were taken many hours before. caffeine and alcohol can also cause frequent urination. for some women it may just be force of habit. very rarely it can be the sign of a tumor in the bladder or pelvis. see your doctor and have a checkup. make sure you mention how many times a night you have to go to the bathroom. he or she will likely get a urine test and some lab work to sort things out. then you will finally be able to get a good night’s sleep.

wart treatments require patience. how well wart treatments work is another matter. warts can appear and disappear without an identifiable cause and may disappear on their own without treatment. some warts sprout offshoots near the main wart and others don't. some hurt and others are painless. certain warts even of the same type respond to treatment while others (even on the same person at the same time) don't. all treatment methods often require many sessions over weeks months or longer to succeed. here is a practical approach to the treatment of warts: 1. if you can ignore your warts do so. eventually they'll go away (although eventually can mean a long time -- even months or years). 2. if you have an easy case (a single wart on the face or one or a few on the hands) see a doctor for a quick freeze or electrical zap. this method is simple almost painless and non-scarring. 3. if you have a hard case you can start by treating the warts for a few weeks on your own. examples: plantar warts: warts on the bottom of the foot feel deep but they are still within the superficial layer of the skin. salicylic-acid drops and plasters help remove the thick overlying callus and make the wart feel less like a marble in your shoe. nonprescription aerosol freezing may be used as well. common hand warts: these are typically unattractive although not painful. salicylic acid can make them smaller and go away in some cases as can nonprescription freezing. if you have an all-but-impossible case don't try too hard. you don't want to make the treatment worse than the disease. examples: warts under the nails: these are extremely resistant to treatment. one or two tries by the doctor are worth a shot but if they fail putting acid on them yourself just makes them look rough and unattractive. "mosaic" warts: tiny so-called seed warts can proliferate by the dozens or hundreds all over the sole of the foot. they don't usually hurt and they rarely respond to any sort of treatment although in this case too one or two tries at treatment may be in order. flat warts: these are small flat flesh-colored pimples and may be numerous on one part of the body (for example on the face arms or groin). getting rid of them by a light application of salicylic acid or other method is easy enough but they have a tendency to recur.

what causes parkinsons disease?

Actual Doctor's Response:
low levels of dopamine a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) involved in controlling movement cause symptoms of parkinson's disease. the shortage of this brain chemical occurs when nerve cells in a part of the brain (substantia nigra) that produces dopamine fail and deteriorate. the exact cause of this deterioration is not known. the links between parkinson's disease and factors such as genetics aging toxins in the environment and free radicals are all under investigation. although these studies are beginning to provide some answers experts do not know the exact cause of the disease. studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a genetic cause of parkinson's disease. only a small percentage of people with parkinson's disease have a parent brother or sister who has the disease; however abnormal genes do seem to be a factor in a few families where early-onset parkinson's disease is common. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra die or become impaired. normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next "relay station" of the brain the corpus striatum to produce smooth purposeful movement. loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. studies have shown that most parkinson's patients have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear. recent studies have shown that people with parkinson's disease also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body such as pulse and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non-motor features seen in parkinson's disease including fatigue and abnormalities of blood pressure regulation. many brain cells of people with parkinson's disease contain lewy bodies -- unusual deposits or clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein along with other proteins. researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of the disease. the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally or they may actually be helpful perhaps by keeping harmful proteins "locked up" so that the cells can function. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson's disease and many more genes have been tentatively linked to the disorder. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson's disease can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson's disease. although the importance of genetics in parkinson's disease is increasingly recognized most researchers believe environmental exposures increase a person's risk of developing the disease. even in familial cases exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 2 3 6-tetrahydropyridine or mptp (found in some kinds of synthetic heroin) that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans. other still-unidentified environmental factors also may cause parkinson's disease in genetically susceptible individuals. viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson's disease. people who developed encephalopathy after a 1918 influenza epidemic were later stricken with severe progressive parkinson's-like symptoms. a group of taiwanese women developed similar symptoms after contracting herpes virus infections. in these women the symptoms which later disappeared were linked to a temporary inflammation of the substantia nigra. several lines of research suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson's disease. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals -- molecules that damage membranes proteins dna and other parts of the cell. this damage is often referred to as oxidative stress. oxidative stress-related changes including free radical damage to dna proteins and fats have been detected in brains of parkinson's disease patients. other research suggests that the cell's protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson's disease causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death. additional studies have found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson's disease may contribute to the death of neurons and that inflammation or overstimulation of cells (because of toxins or other factors) may play a role in the disease. however the precise role of the protein deposits remains unknown. some researchers even speculate that the protein buildup is part of an unsuccessful attempt to protect the cell. while mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson's disease the actual cause of the dopamine cell death is still undetermined.

what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

" of all couples with unexplained infertility who do not seek treatment about 35% will naturally become pregnant within 3 years and 45% do so within 7 years. 2 major factors that affect your chances of conceiving with or without treatment include age how long you have been trying to conceive and the cause of infertility. female fertility normally decreases with age. the older a woman is (particularly over age 35) the less likely she is to become pregnant and the more likely she is to miscarry. this is primarily due to the aging of her egg supply. a woman who is over 40 and fails to ovulate despite medicine or who does not respond to in vitro fertilization therapy is encouraged to use donor eggs. a couple's chances of conceiving are greatest within their first 3 years of trying. after 3 years of sex without birth control pregnancy is considered unlikely without treatment. 1 if a clear cause of infertility can be determined and if there is a promising treatment for that cause pregnancy is more likely. treatment for unexplained infertility is less likely to be successful. but medicines or assisted reproductive techniques may still be effective. some couples who have tried infertility treatment without success become pregnant later without more treatment. personal concerns related to infertility include: emotional and social impact of infertility testing and treatment on you and your partner. ethical and legal issues related to assisted reproductive technology such as how many embryos to transfer to the uterus and what to do with unused embryos. considering adoption instead of or after trying infertility treatment. setting limits on testing to avoid overextending yourselves emotionally physically and financially. setting limits on treatment considering your age-related fertility and financial resources. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant? . we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i don't want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i don't want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he doesn't quit as well. i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker. he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking! i am a father of a recently born child i was told by the wife and quote if you want to smoke do it outside and so i took my 7 yr old smoking chair and headed for the door she has been a happy woman since. and also i learned 1 thing from it. it is so much more easier to change my bad habits when i know she carried my son for 9 months and still cooked and cleaned. . and every bad habit i have could potentially put my son's health at risk! p. s. tell him to stop being lazy and take his butt outside to smoke his baby cant defend itself!

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. sinus pain can feel so miserable! sinusitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tissue that lines the sinus cavities. this swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain (and sometimes an infection). sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment. i hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have nasal polyps. while polyps aren't extremely common in 14 year olds they're not unheard of. if you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an ear-nose-throat doctor for an exam. meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including: using a vaporizer (warm mist) in your bedroom (be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold) inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot (not boiling) water warm compresses (wash rag soaked in very warm water) laid across the eyes/bridge of the nose saline nose drops (available over the counter) if there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms. if possible spend as much time as you can in a smoke-free environment. because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom pet-free and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly. i hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief!

Patient Question:
how is income used to calculate subsidy eligibility in the health insurance exchanges?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the formula to find out if you qualify for a subsidy on the health insurance exchanges seems complicated but it is actually quite simple. let’s walk through it. the subsidy calculation is based on your income and the average cost of certain health plans on the exchange. subsidies are only available to those who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (fpl). in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. the amount of subsidy you receive depends upon where your income falls between the 100% and 400% fpl range. for example if your income is 100% fpl you are only responsible for the amount of monthly premiums that equals 2% of your income. anything above that dollar amount is considered your subsidy. below is the chart from 100-400% fpl of how much of your income you will have to pay towards your monthly premiums on the exchange. these percentages of income are not your subsidy; they are your contribution. the subsidy is calculated per individual or family based upon the dollar amount that goes over this contribution. income amount of income responsible for in premiums 100-133% fpl 2% of income 133-150% fpl 3 – 4% of income 150-200% fpl 4 – 6. 3% of income 200-250% fpl 6. 3 – 8. 05% of income 250-300% fpl 8. 05 – 9. 5% of income 300-400% fpl 9. 5% of income also beginning on january 1 2015 if your employer offers health insurance but your portion of the monthly premiums in your employer-based plan cost 9. 5% or more of your income you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you are diagnosed with high blood pressure it's important to see your doctor on a regular basis. he or she can answer your questions during these visits. however there may be other times when you may need to speak to your doctor sooner. these include if you aren't responding to the prescribed treatment and your blood pressure is still high and if you are having any side effects from the blood pressure medication. if this happens your doctor may wish to adjust the dosage of the medication or put you on another medication.

how to get off suboxone subliginal strips without withdrawl. i take 1-3 8mg suboxone strips a day. ive been taking them for a little over a year and was looking for the best way to get off them.

Actual Doctor's Response:
my best advice to speak to your healthcare provider -- the one that prescribes the strips to you. he or she can help you transition off the suboxone. if on the other hand you mean you obtain the strips illicitly and now want to stop using them then i advise you seek addiction counseling. sure you can taper off the suboxone dose on your own successfully but you need to address the underlying reasons why you began using suboxone to begin with. any addiction involves 'environmental' and emotional factors as well as the actual physical addiction. suboxone addiction is becoming a real problem. if this is the situation with you i'm sorry you've found yourself in this predicament. but there is help available. i commend you for getting off this substance. there is no shame in seeking help. wishing you well! the best way the only one that works is to gradually reduce the dose around -25% every 10 days never make a sudden stop or you will feel all the terrible effect of withdrawal! you can read in details the "taper technique" here : <link> good luck and keep in mind : even if you feel well continue to reduce the dose gradually takes you time

yes allegra is the same as fexofenadine. every medication has two names a brand and a generic name. the original creators are the only ones who can use the brand name. once the recipe becomes available to other drug manufacturers they sell the product under the generic name. it usually takes approximately seven years for the brand to go generic. the main active ingredient has to remain the same in each recipe. what differs from the brand and generic are the inactive ingredients that can hold the medication together and that give it its color. in addition the generic can be much more affordable. most generics are fda approved to be equally effective. therefore if the generic works for you then there is no need to switch. also make sure to only take one and not both the brand and generic to prevent overdosing and additive side effects.

here's a longer preview of my question with details: hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 and some days would exercise with my partner for nearly 2 hours almost 2 times a month. i've been working on eating correctly as well (oats fruit no processed foods/sugars). i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 or more glasses of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting heart rate ranges from 74-80 bpm. my problem is during 2 weeks i've been experiencing high pulse rates from (94-104) and on some days a single heart flutter. sometimes during sleeping i wake with strange high pulses. a few days ago i've awaken from a deep dreaming sleep having two heart flutters and freaked out. near the end of the day i get these weird stingy/squeezy chest pains that occur near my left breast very close to the armpit. sometimes i get the same pain at the same spot in my right chest but it's much lighter than the left. my leg elbows of my arms and stomach would also have very mild/light pains that pulsate but disappear after a while. this happens when i'm resting but not when i exercise. they last from 2-20 seconds and disappear or reoccur slightly when in bed. the day before this past halloween i visited a doctor at a clinic and she basically laughed at me saying i was too paranoid and having anxiety. she checked my heart beat and breathing through a stethoscope but no more after that. she said i was too young to be having heart problems. i'm afraid of going back due to spending way too much money just to hear the same reply. this is starting to scare me and i'm very hesitant to return to my regular exercise and weight training since this has been happening. i don't think i have diabetes since i don't get the symptoms (and i'm like a hawk keeping an eye on any similar rising symptoms if i get them). should i continue with my daily activities? how about suggested foods to eat in a single day for healthy heart function? again i don't eat a lot of sugars. thank you.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer sweet's syndrome (also called sweet syndrome and known medically as "acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis") is a rare skin condition in which a painful bluish-red rash appears usually on just one side of the body along with a fever. most of the time sweet's appears on its own with no known cause. about 2 out of 10 cases may be related to a serious underlying disorder like cancer. the rash of sweet syndrome evolves in a very predictable fashion. it usually starts on the arms back neck or face. the initial bumps are small and red and occur after a fever or upper respiratory infection. this rash quickly grows into clusters of bumps that may measure an inch in diameter. the bumps almost always are painful and may develop blisters. these lesions may clear up on their own but it can take months for this to happen. if you develop this type of rash after a fever or upper respiratory infection you'd be well-advised to consult a doctor. with appropriate treatment the rash of sweet syndrome may clear up within days. i hope this answers your question!

can shrimp and french fries cooked in the same greese cause allergic reaction. hi at the age of 40 i developed an allergie to peanuts and shellfish at the same time. i had the test run they came back negative. so i went to red lobster and two hours later was rushed to the hospital with a shellfish allergie. two weeks later bought a snickers out of a vending machine back to the er.

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in cross-contamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil. cross-contamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are re-used without cleaning. when eating out at restaurants it’s important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiter/waitress so that the cook/chef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food. even if you don’t think that the food that you’re ordering contains any of your allergens it’s better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents. it will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no cross-contamination. i would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods. in the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an epipen so that you’re able to stop allergic reactions fast any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. best advice: if you're allergic to shellfish never eat somewhere that serves it. lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in snickers. stay far away from things you're allergic to and talk to your doctor about an epi-pen.

well maybe. if you shared a straw with someone who has ever had a cold sore (caused by the herpes simplex virus ) then yes. even if the person had no active cold sore it's still possible to pick up the virus from them. and not necessarily just from the straw -- if you shared a glass bottle or can of soda with a person who has hsv then you could get the virus from them. the odds of getting a cold sore from a random can bottle or glass of soda (that is not a container someone else drank from) is very very small. if you developed a cold sore after enjoying a frosty beverage it's likely you were exposed to hsv some time before you drank the soda and the two events are not related. hope this helps!

chances of becoming pregnant? . was recently diagnosed with pcos (not a severe case just hormones off balanced and testosterone was high) dr put me on metformin about 2 weeks ago. saturday night i noticed some a bit more discharge than usual and sunday it was definitely ewcm. had unprotected sex saturday night and sunday around 10am and again at 6pm. this morning when i went to the bathroom at 5am there was some ewcm and now i am just "wet". how likely is it that i can become pregnant?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi so you know how this all works? having unprotected sex saturday night wont make you pregnant by sunday sorry but that's a fact. if you know how it works you will know that the first day of your cycle is day! so around day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day but you need to have unprotected sex say 3 to 4 days before that? why well it takes 3 days for sperm to get in place to receive your egg so if around day 21 you get some spotting this could be a sign your on your way to getting pregnant so if you miss your next period and wait a week your then go get tested or do an hpt. so now do you see? good luck

Actual Doctor's Response:
there may be two reasons: one reason would be that he is in great shape. runners tend to have slower heart rates (50-60 bpm) so if he is a runner in good shape this could account for a slower and stronger heart rate. unfortunately another reason could be a hidden cardiac problem. i don't know how slow his heart rate is or if his heart rate is regular skipping beats etc so it would be wise for him to have a sports clearance by his medical provider or even a cardiologist. this would be for your son's own protection.

assuming your story is accurate the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is very very small. ovulation occurs about 2 weeks after menstruation so this was not her "fertile" time. there is still a very remote chance that some of your sperm (it only takes one sperm out of millions) will remain viable if she ovulates early. you are very foolish for not using a condom so don't ever put your girlfriend at risk ever again. condoms also help prevent sexually-transmitted diseases. if your girlfriend was hiv positive than yes you are now at risk as well. if she does not have hiv or aids you are not at risk. if you are going to be having sex in the future please do so safely. use a condom.

Actual Doctor's Response:
no single factor is known to cause lupus. research suggests that a combination of genetic hormonal and immune system factors may be behind it. a predisposition to developing the disease appears to be inherited. environmental factors ranging from viral and bacterial infections to severe emotional stress or overexposure to sunlight may play a role in provoking or triggering the disease. certain drugs such as the blood pressure drug hydralazine and the heart rhythm drug procainamide may cause lupus-like symptoms. high estrogen levels resulting from pregnancy estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives may aggravate lupus.

if you are having periods off of your birth control pills then you are not yet menopausal. you may be perimenopausal which means you are getting close to menopause. menopause is when you have gone 1 year without a period while off of birth control or hormone replacement. it is difficult to know when menopause occurs while taking the pill but your doctor can check your hormone levels while on the placebo pills to get an idea if you are menopausal or not. although it would be unlikely that you would get pregnant at the age of 48 it is still possible if you are having periods. i recommend that you go see your doctor to discuss the best options for you.

there are two methods of naturally boosting your testosterone level that are effective safe and health-promoting: lose weight. experts don’t know exactly why but it’s clear that losing pounds tends to push testosterone levels up. exercise. physical activity will tend to improve testosterone but weight lifting or other resistance exercise gives testosterone the biggest boost. keep in mind the lower limit of normal for a testosterone test comes from what’s abnormally low for a young man. testosterone naturally declines with age so “low” may actually be just fine for an otherwise healthy man in his 40s or older. many men with supposedly “low testosterone” have plenty of energy muscle mass and libido. others don’t but it’s not always clear that’s due to the low testosterone level.

Actual Doctor's Response:
shingles is contagious so there is the potential that you could pass the virus to one of your patients particularly babies and children or adults who have not either had the chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. as long as you have new blisters appearing you are contagious. you should likely avoid contact with patients during this time as it will be difficult to know if they're immune. once all the blisters have crusted over and no new ones are forming you are no longer contagious and can return to normal work duties. you can ask your doctor about antiviral medicines for shingles as that may help shorten the duration so that you can safely return to work sooner.

Actual Doctor's Response:
no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it.

will hot baths permanently damage sperm?

Actual Doctor's Response:
sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas.

i have a formula that people can use. the formula is basically this: take a 90 minute segment and count back five 90 minute segments from when your scheduled wake up time is and that should probably be about when you should go to bed. pick your wakeup time. so let’s say it’s 7:00 am. then we know the average sleep cycle is somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes so you want to count and we know you need about 5 of those. so count backwards for 5 ninety minutes segments from 7:00 am and you’d get i believe it’s 11:30 okay. that’s how you can really tell if you’re refreshed or sleep deprived things of that nature because if you’re not getting that individualized sleep number as it were that’s when you’re going to feel it. there is a myth going on out there that we all need eight hours of sleep and i’m here to tell you that’s absolutely not true. there is no perfect sleep number out there for everyone. everyone’s number is a bit individualized and so what we’ve learned from the data basically is when you wake up and feel refreshed look back and see how many of hours of sleep you got and that’s probably your sleep number.

where did all the quarter-pounders go? suddenly half-pound hamburgers are all you see on restaurant menus anymore. how is this a good thing? sure you could split the burger with someone but what are the odds that your meal companion is also going to want a burger? the other option is to cut it in half and take the other half home but you aren’t always going to be able to safely deliver the leftovers to your refrigerator within two hours. plus you probably don’t want to eat a hamburger two days in a row. sounds a little nutty but we actually played this out this scenario at the table a few weeks ago when my daughter wanted to order a hamburger in a restaurant that only offered half-pounders. we ended up telling the servers to make a quarter-pounder patty instead for her (still paid for the half pounder though). over the next few weeks we noticed that several other restaurants only offered half-pound burgers as well. i was hoping we were going in the opposite direction and eating smaller burgers not larger ones. share the monster burger and you would still be getting around 400 calories 23 grams of fat and 10 grams of saturated fat. perhaps it’s simply better to look for a more healthful menu option.

what kind of food can i eat after a vires. three people in my home had a verse 24 hour stomach. now two days has pass. what can we eat?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you can basically eat anything you want -- your normal diet (whatever that might be). your body will respond if this "stomach virus" is still rearing its ugly head. for instance if you get nausea or diarrhea (again? ) you may have to eat a bit more reasonably for a few more days. viral infections last about a week but most people feel better on day four.

Actual Doctor's Response:
first it’s good to be concerned and thoughtful about how you will please your partner – just don’t get too worried about it; approaching it with relaxation and ease is more productive for you. second try practicing edging for a couple of weeks. edging involves masturbating right up until the point of ejaculating then stopping before the ejaculation occurs; letting the urge to ejaculate subside; then masturbating to the edge again; and repeating this over and over without ejaculating for as long as you can – at least half an hour. doing this every day for 2-3 weeks helps many men learn control over their ejaculations when with a partner. it also gives them a sore red penis but using a quality penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) that includes both vitamin e (a natural hydrator) and she abutter (an excellent emollient) can help reduce the soreness.

what are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?

Actual Doctor's Response:
people with bipolar disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that occur in distinct periods called "mood episodes. " an overly joyful or overexcited state is called a manic episode and an extremely sad or hopeless state is called a depressive episode. sometimes a mood episode includes symptoms of both mania and depression. this is called a mixed state. people with bipolar disorder also may be explosive and irritable during a mood episode. extreme changes in energy activity sleep and behavior go along with these changes in mood. it is possible for someone with bipolar disorder to experience a long-lasting period of unstable moods rather than discrete episodes of depression or mania. a person may be having an episode of bipolar disorder if he or she has a number of manic or depressive symptoms for most of the day nearly every day for at least one or two weeks. sometimes symptoms are so severe that the person cannot function normally at work school or home.

the short answer is: no. different antibiotics treat different types of bacterial infections. for example penicillin is considered a "broad spectrum" antibiotic because it kills a wide array of bacteria. your health care provider probably prescribed two different types of antibiotics for your diverticulitis because he or she suspects there may be different types of bacteria involved in the infection. by giving you two different antibiotics your provider is trying to make sure all the possible different bacteria are killed. so please take both the antibiotics you were prescribed. take them exactly as prescribed on the label and be sure to take all the pills. do not stop taking the pills just because you start to feel better. this type of behavior can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. hope this helps!

unprotected intercourse at the time of ovulation can result in pregnancy. this is the most likely time of the month to get pregnant and this time frame is called a 'fertilty window'. after being released through ovulation an egg lives for 12- 24 hours. sperm can survive for three to five days. what this means is that pregnancy is possible with unprotected intercourse even before ovulation. the reason for this? : sperm released during sex 2-3 days prior to ovulation can survive until after ovulation. this can result in fertilization and pregnancy in someone that is sexually active not having a period is one of the most common signs of pregnancy. the simpliest way to determine if she is pregnant is a home pregnancy test which should be confirmed with an office visit and laboratory testing.

if you have any type of skin wart it means that you came in contact with a wart-causing virus sometime in the past. “people get warts from other people with warts. they don't get them from frogs and toads ” says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. “the most common way is direct skin-to-skin contact such as shaking hands with someone who has warts on their hand. you can also get the virus from inanimate objects like towels that have been used by someone with a wart. ” the viruses are more likely to cause warts when they come in contact with skin that is damaged or cut. getting a small scrape or biting fingernails may bring on a wart. similarly cuts and nicks from shaving can provide an avenue for infection.

the most common way to treat epilepsy is with medication. specific drugs are prescribed depending on the type of epilepsy or seizure a person has. when medication doesn't work surgery is another treatment option. in some cases a surgeon can remove the area of the brain producing seizures or can interrupt the nerve pathways that signal seizures. for children a very strict meal plan called the ketogenic diet may reduce seizures. if a patient doesn't respond to medication and surgery is not an option vagus nerve stimulation can help prevent seizures. it works through a battery implant in the chest that delivers small pulses of electrical energy into the brain via the vagus nerve in the neck. the downside: it doesn't work for everyone and it is not approved by the fda for kids younger than age 12.

Actual Doctor's Response:
these innocent little red areas are called subconjunctival hemorrhages. they are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels. they appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see. if these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed. blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be straining. straining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement. i saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages. she had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior! people who take aspirin or other blood-thinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages. if you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider.

most helpful answer some people do experience vertigo and lightheadedness when taking bp meds. it happens a lot when going from laying to standing or sitting to standing. i recommend getting in these positions slowly and standing still for a few seconds before walking. these symptoms can also mean that your bp is dropping too low. if it continues and happens at other times besides just changing positions call your doctor. your meds may need to be lowered a bit or switched to something else.

surgery is indicated in a small group of children. it usually takes the failure of two or three anti-epileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. in general this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. the failure might be due: to a resistance to the anti-epileptic medications that are available. to the presence of intolerable side effects to the anti-epileptic medication. to a combination of both. since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with anti-epileptic medications surgery should be considered. young age is not a contraindication for surgery and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. in fact there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. there is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. this plasticity is higher in younger than in older children.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging.

Patient Question:
what if i want to become pregnant or want to stop using implanon for another reason before three years?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your healthcare provider can remove implanon at any time with a minor surgical procedure in the office. the information on your user card may help your healthcare provider find implanon. after removal keep the removal site clean dry and bandaged for three to five days to lessen the chance of infection. if you want to become pregnant your ability to get pregnant usually returns quickly. some women have become pregnant within days after removal of implanon. if you do not want to become pregnant you should start another birth control method right away. additional information if you would like more information talk with your healthcare provider. you can ask your healthcare provider for information about implanon that is written for healthcare providers.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9645
you should see your healthcare provider right away. it is important to remove implanon and make sure that the pregnancy is not ectopic (occurring outside the womb). based on experience with birth control pills implanon is not likely to cause birth defects.

Patient Question:
is a heart attack or cardia arrest ultimately more life threatening?

Actual Doctor's Response:
obviously a completely stopped heart (cardiac arrest) is more life-threating since you only have a few precious minutes to get it ticking again or death will occur. a "heart attack" is lay term that refers to dozens of different serious cardiac conditions some that are life-threating and some not-so-much.

stress is a well-known cause of diarrhea but usually in the acute situation. for example before a final examination a student may have the urge to have a bowel movement and the bowel movement may be looser than usual. chronic diarrhea is less likely to be caused by stress. the relationship between stress and constipation has not been studied much. since stress causes most things to be worse it is possible that it also exacerbates constipation or at least the perception of it. the major causes of troublesome constipation relate to muscular abnormalities of the colon and rectum and these are not stress-related to the best of our knowledge.

Patient Question:
is antibiotic resistance unique to our era?

Actual Doctor's Response:
what makes this a particularly unique time in antibiotic resistance is that the pace of development of resistance is really outstripping the development of new drugs. in the past we knew there were new drugs coming on the market -- every year we had something new. now we've reached a situation where that's not the case year to year. for some [germs] that we see a resistance to in hospitals there's nothing coming anytime soon. we're facing a situation now where people are talking about the unavailability of antibiotics to treat common infections.

Model's Recommendation:

the answer is yes. studies now confirm what we all knew to be true –- prolonged stress does lead to premature and rapid aging of every cell in the body. stress is the ultimate mind-body connection. when we perceive stress our body responds rapidly with a multitude of changes. changes intended to prepare us for the fight or flight response. our heart rate goes up our blood pressure increases blood flow is increased to the brain heart and muscles. protective hormones adrenaline and other chemicals begin surging through the bloodstream nerves begin firing all senses are brought to peak awareness. all this so we are in a state of extreme readiness to take on any threat. this was good hundreds and thousands years ago. what about today? stress is inevitable. with so much stress from work and life that is not a threat to our survival what does all this stress do to our bodies? long term intense stress is not good for the body and accelerates aging. this is especially true if you don’t feel in control over the things that are causing stress. when the stresses do not resolve your immune system is weakened. stressed individuals become ill more frequently. excessive stress actually shortens the life span of the cells throughout the body so that every tissue and organ is ages rapidly. the body begins accumulating highly toxic levels of free radical particles that cause even more oxidative damage to cells and tissues. damage that promotes aging. and because the stress response is so quick to come on and so slow to fade it is likely that those in prolonged high stress occupations like [the united states] president begin to age rapidly –- an aging process we can see over time in their face graying of hair and behavior. the answer? do your best to avoid or reduce excessive and prolonged stress. if that is not possible eat a healthy diet high in anti-oxidant rich foods exercise regularly sleep and laugh. most importantly work to develop stress reduction behaviors and attitudes so that you can better deal with any stresses you experience.

Actual Doctor's Response:
my mom's cousin says she can no longer taste food because of a side effect of metformin and now weighs less than 100 pounds. have you noticed this in your patients? no loss of taste sensation is not an expected side effect of metformin and i cannot recall any patients i've met with this side effect however it is certainly possible that there are some patients out there with this side effect and if your mom's cousin believes it then it is probably true in her case. naturally there are medical conditions that could cause loss of taste sensation and weight loss independent of diabetes.

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a question that a pharmacist is going to ask that patient a lot of other questions. i need to know who has the upset stomach. and for how long have they had this upset stomach? this could be some occasional heartburn it could be though something much more serious. sometimes upset stomachs can also lead to things like viral infections. so we may not want to necessarily treat it. we want to find out if this is an elderly patient may be they've had it for a long time and there is another medication that could be causing this upset stomach as well. so we are going to have to find a little bit more information. so things like telling us what medications you are taking? are you taking any over-the-counter or herbals because they have a possibility of possibly causing an upset stomach as well finding out if you are running a fever. all these little questions that we are going to ask you are probably going to help us help you better.

diarrhea is a condition that once again as a pharmacist i can tell you all the time i ask a lot of questions especially around the fact of are you running a fever? how long have you had the diarrhea for? is the diarrhea -- do you have dark though diarrhea? because that could be a sign of internal bleeding. so you want to be very careful about the suggestions that we make. in the case of diarrhea too medications sometimes aren't always the best choice. you want to change your diet? you want to make sure that you are hydrated. a lot of people forget that when you have diarrhea you lose a lot of fluids. so you want to do re-hydration first. things like pedialyte increasing your water intake and then introducing all foods in general. typically in the past there was something called the brat diet which was bran rice applesauce and toast to help with diarrhea. that actually is not the recommendation anymore they actually want people to start eating pretty normally to get their body back in balance as well as increasing their fluids. only then if there are some problems where they say you know i've been increasing my diet i still have a little bit of diarrhea imodium or something like that be appropriate. but we do need to ask a few questions to find out what is really going on?

Patient Question:
how do you diagnose hashimoto's hypothyroidism and does this condition have effect on heart disease and osteoporosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hashimoto's thyroiditis can be diagnosed by biopsy. however clinical history along with a blood test confirming hypothyroidism plus the addition of anti-tpo antibodies and a thyroid scan (if needed) also secures the diagnosis in most cases. treatment involves starting thyroid hormone replacement (synthroid levoxyl) to maintain a thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level within the normal range. if the thyroid is large enough to cause symptoms of compression (difficultly swallowing hoarseness wheezing) surgery to debunk or remove the gland may be considered if the gland dose not shrink on replacement therapy. in regard to your question about heart disease the relationship is more related to replacement therapy of the thyroid hormones than with hashimoto's itself. as the gland starts to lose function hypothyroidism can result. hypothyroidism is treated by replacing the inappropriately low or absent endogenous thyroid hormone with a synthetic equivalent taken daily by mouth (synthroid or levoxyl for example). should a patient receive too much thyroid hormone the high dose can result in palpitations irregular heartbeat and over time a weakened heart. it can also result in osteoporosis. if the hormone is under-replaced it can exacerbate heart failure adversely affect cholesterol levels and slow heart rates down. naturally if hashimoto's resulting in hypothyroidism remains unreplaced completely this can also occur.

decreased physical activity which may be the result of cancer or of treatment can lead to tiredness and lack of energy. scientists have found that even healthy athletes forced to spend extended periods in bed or sitting in chairs develop feelings of anxiety depression weakness fatigue and nausea. regular moderate exercise can decrease these feelings help you stay active and increase your energy. even during cancer therapy it is often possible to continue exercising. in fact research has shown that cancer patients who perform a moderate exercise routine have a better quality of life and better outcomes. here are some exercise guidelines to keep in mind if you have cancer: check with your doctor before beginning an exercise program. a good exercise program starts slowly allowing your body time to adjust. keep a regular exercise schedule. exercising at least three times a week is optimal. the right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore stiff or exhausted. if you experience soreness stiffness exhaustion or feel out of breath as a result of your exercise you are overdoing it. most exercises are safe as long as you exercise with caution and don't overdo it. the safest and most productive activities are swimming brisk walking indoor stationary cycling and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified instructor). these activities carry little risk of injury and benefit your entire body.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed.

if your implanon has expired you need to be using another form of birth control until you have it replaced with a new one (now called explanon). i don't know if you are pregnant or not but yes the possibility exists since no birth control method other than surgical sterilization and complete abstinence is 100%. see your medical provider or planned parenthood so you can have a more sensitive pregnancy test and examination.

how to know when congestive heart failure is cured? it was caused by pulmonary hypertension. i've still fluid retention. after 10 days of failed lasix dosage has now been increased to total 160 mg lasix a day. beta blocker has my heart rate averaging 80 bpm. my right foot is often ice cold sometimes my whole right leg. my next cardiologist appt is in 2-1/2 weeks.

Actual Doctor's Response:
as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). that’s the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.

Patient Question:
how can i help research on epilepsy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.

controlling seizures caused by epilepsy requires a daily commitment to following your treatment plan. if you are using antiepileptic medicine you must take your medicine exactly as prescribed. not following the treatment plan is one of the main reasons why medicines fail to control seizures. antiepileptic medicines will work only if the right medicine level is maintained in your body. your doctor will set up a schedule of medicine dosages that keeps the proper medicine levels in your body. missing one or more doses can throw the whole system off. see information on: epilepsy: taking your medicines properly. the same rule about following your treatment plan applies if you or your child is on a special ketogenic diet. the ketogenic diet can be hard to follow but it must be followed exactly. as you follow your treatment plan also try to identify and avoid things that may make you more likely to have a seizure such as: not getting enough sleep. using drugs or alcohol. being emotionally stressed. skipping meals. if you continue to have seizures despite treatment keep a record of any seizures you have. note the date time of day and any details about the seizure that you can remember. your doctor can use information about your seizures to plan or adjust your medicine or other treatment. if you have not been diagnosed with epilepsy a record of your seizures can help your doctor figure out whether you might have epilepsy and what kinds of seizures you are having. if your child or someone else in your family has epilepsy learn what to do when someone has a seizure. if you have epilepsy (or your child has epilepsy): be sure that any doctor treating you for any condition knows that you have epilepsy and knows what medicines you are taking if any. wear a medical identification bracelet (such as medicalert). in the event of a seizure or accident that leaves you unconscious or unable to speak for yourself a medical id bracelet will let those who are treating you know that you have epilepsy. it will also list any medicines you are taking to control your seizures so that you are not given any medicines that will react badly with those already in your body. if you have a child with epilepsy there are other tips for parents that may be helpful. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Actual Doctor's Response:
do not put anything inside the cast. this could irritate the skin with small micro-cuts which can lead to an infection. do not use talc or creams inside a plaster cast. these become gritty when mixed with sweat which could also irritate the skin and cause an allergy or infection. raise your arm or leg up above chest level for about 1 hour. this can help reduce the swelling and cool the area which would decrease the itch. if it is too intense talk with your pharmacist about using an oral antihistamine for the itching. be cautious about drug-drug interactions or drowsiness. if the itching is still too intense check with you doctor about recasting the area.

what are good treatments for rosacea at age 36?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your first step is to avoid direct sun exposure alcohol or any other lifestyle factors that may irritate your skin and trigger rosacea outbreaks. there is no cure for rosacea but with treatment you may be able to control the symptoms. antibiotic pills and topical creams may treat symptoms. topical tretinoin compounds and lasers may be used to control refractory rosacea. i have had rosacea since my late 20s (now in my late 30s) here are the tips i've learned: be religious about sunscreen. if i have direct sunlight without sunscreen i will be red for hours experiment and learn which products work best to control your rosacea. everyone is different but once you find stuff stick with it. i've found that baby shampoo as a cleanser while a little drying does the best at controlling my rosacea of all things. i've also found that larenim and pure minerals makeups actually help clear up my rosacea rather than causing more probelms. most of the tips i'd learned when i first got it was about knowing and avoiding triggers. my triggers are sunlight exercise and alcohol.

what surgery options do i have for prostate cancer advanced or metastatic?

Actual Doctor's Response:
surgery to treat prostate cancer is usually reserved for men in good health who are younger than 70 and who choose to have surgery. surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and to slow the growth of cancer. surgery choices radical prostatectomy the removal of the prostate and its cancer. it is not usually done if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. orchiectomy the removal of the testicles. this may cause the cancer to shrink and may improve symptoms because prostate cancer often needs the testosterone made by the testicles to grow. turp or transurethral resection of the prostate. this operation can help to relieve bladder problems because it removes part of the tumor that may be blocking the urethra the tube that carries urine from your bladder through your penis. this can keep the tumor from growing for a while. but turp does not take out the whole tumor. what to think about a study suggests that advanced prostate cancer can sometimes be cured if the cancer has spread to only a few lymph nodes and great care is used to completely remove the lymph nodes during prostatectomy. 14 radiation and hormone treatment may be used afterwards to destroy any remaining cancer cells. surgical removal of the testicles ( orchiectomy ) and hormone therapy medicines have some of the same side effects including hot flashes larger breasts loss of sexual desire and the inability to have an erection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

surgery to remove cancer may be used to treat metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. the type of surgery chosen depends upon the stage of the cancer. surgery choices surgical options include: bowel resection. this operation involves cutting into the abdomen to reach the area of the colon or rectum that is affected by the cancer. the surgeon cuts out the cancer as well as the parts of the colon or rectum that are next to it. then the two healthy ends of the colon or rectum are sewn back together. liver resection. in this operation the surgeon cuts out cancer that has spread to the liver as well as parts of the liver that are next to the cancer. up to half of your liver can be removed as long as the rest is healthy. two other methods to destroy cancer cells in the liver include radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) and heat (microwave coagulation). cryosurgery. also called cryotherapy this type of surgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. it is used when the tumors in the liver are still fairly small. if cancer that has returned to your intestine is large more of your colon or rectum may have to be removed. the ends of your colon or rectum are rejoined during surgery. if they can't be rejoined you may need a colostomy. most people do not need a permanent colostomy. for more information see: bowel disease: caring for your ostomy. when cancer has spread to other parts of the body the kind of surgery you will need depends on where the cancer is and how big the tumor is. sometimes surgery is used not to cure your cancer but to make your life more comfortable. if a tumor is blocking your colon for example the surgeon may remove it to allow your intestine to work normally. if advanced cancer is blocking your rectum your doctor may place an expandable tube called a stent in the rectum to unblock it. what to think about surgery may be used to remove metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer that is confined to the colon or that has spread to the liver lungs or bones. surgery does not usually cure metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer but it may relieve pain and discomfort slow the spread of the disease and help you live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i don't think that anyone knows for sure at this point. pancreatic cancer has been around a long time before lipitor and most people who have pancreatic cancer have never used it. keep abreast of any new information that may surface on the medical sites but an "association" is not necessarily a "cause". you could easily make an association that people who eat at a certain fast food chain have a higher level of a disease than someone who doesn't or that a large percentage of people who have a type of cancer had driven a car prior to the diagnosis. these are "associations". if any definitive studies are found with a causative relationship any suspect drug is immediately pulled from the market.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

in the world of conception just about anything is possible when you are havinig unprotected sex. if this is truly your normal period it certainly would be less likely to be ovulating a day before. because of your prior pregnancy experience i can understand your concern. you are wise to be cautious. and it is okay to continue to worry a bit until you have a negative pregnancy test or another normal period.

a high thyroglobin antibody level in and of itself does not mean you have thyroid disease. they are found in nearly 20% of all women. however high levels of thyroglobulin antibodies associated with other thyroid antibodies are found in 80 to 90% of people with immune mediated inflammation of the thyroid (hashimoto’s thyroiditis). this is the most common type of thyroid hormone deficiency in the u. s. thyroglobulin antibodies are also found in pregnant women relatives of patients with hashimoto’s thyroiditis and in people with other immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes. the usual course of hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. antibodies to thyroglobulin are considered to occur as a result of damage to the thyroid from special white blood cells (t cells). common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue being cold all the time weight gain constipation dry skin and menstrual irregularities. since these symptoms occur in other diseases it is important not to always blame thyroid deficiency as the cause. fortunately laboratory tests for thyroid function make this diagnosis relatively easy. however because loss of thyroid hormone develops over time and antibodies can herald problems you will want to follow-up with your doctor about your thyroid tests and your symptoms.

yes you do. hormone replacement therapy such as using estrogen for the symptoms of menopause must be done under the supervision of a medical provider. if you're experiencing the symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes (flushes) vaginal dryness and sleeplessness then i'd suggest you speak to your gynecologist or primary care provider can assess whether or not you're a candidate for hormone replacement therapy. keep in mind taking estrogen carries risks such as blood clots and strokes. you and your health care provider need to discuss the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy in your unique situation. best wishes to you!

Patient Question:
my son got sand thrown in his eye and it is swollen. we did rinse it out with water. what is the next step?

Actual Doctor's Response:
ahhh. sandbox eyes. i see this quite often. the next step assuming he is still crying rubbing his eyes and complaining is to see a medical provider to see if he has a corneal abrasion - a painful scratch on the cornea. you will need to take him to an urgent care facility. the medical provider will put a drop or two of an anesthetic solution to numb the eye (instant relief! ). a tiny amount of bright-yellow fluorecein dye will be put in the eye to reveal any scratch. it can be seen using a "black light" in a darkened examination room. if he does have a tiny scratch he will need some antibiotic drops or ointment for a few days while it heals. these things are painful but fortunately they heal very fast.

your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment. her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle. i would ask her physician to look into two conditions: cushing's disease and polycystic ovarian syndrome. the evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies. clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well. if the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence. teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what she's actually consuming. if the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then she'll emulate those habits. finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of 14 or so. they literally stop moving. but they don't stop eating. thus the problem. please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible.

Patient Question:
will you be able to get frost bite exposing your hands for 10 minutes in 30 degrees. a friend of mine said that she was driving a person home who did not want the defroster on in the car so in order to have the window defrosted she had to put the windows down for less than 10 minutes. the temperature outside was 35 degrees so is it possible for this person to get frost bite?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's certainly not likely. frostbite is the term we use when our body's tissue literally freezes. as you can imagine this process can take quite some time. commonly frostbite occurs when bare skin is exposed to sub-freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time. the process can occur faster if the bare skin is for example engulfed in snow or ice. and covered tissue (like skin fingers toes etc. ) isn't protected from frostbite either. many people have had their toes frozen by standing in knee-deep snow for hours even while wearing heavy boots. driving with the car windows down for 10 minutes in 35-degree weather isn't likely to produce frostbite. even if it did it would probably only produce a very mild case involving a few skin layers. hope this answers your question!

i don't know anything about you to blindly determine a specific cause not even your sex. if you are male and over the age of 50 it could be bph (benign prostatic hypertrophy). if you are a female one would need to consider a urinary tract infection or variety of urinary tract problems. and in either sex nocturia (the medical name for this condition) could be one of the signs of diabetes. on a more simple case you could be drinking too much in the evening and not completely emptying your bladder. see your medical provider. this is really the only way to determine a reason and hopefully find a solution.

one of the first pregnancy symptoms you may notice is that your period does not arrive. while this symptom is one we most commonly associate with pregnancy there may be other reasons why a period hasn’t arrived for example high levels of stress major illness or surgery. another well known pregnancy symptom is morning sickness. morning sickness can pay you a visit any time of day so make sure you eat enough and avoid letting your blood sugar levels drop. ginger is a great natural remedy for nausea so it’s worth a try although some women find that nothing seems to help their morning sickness which normally hangs around for the first trimester before getting better or if you are unlucky the second trimester or even whole pregnancy. for more details click on early pregnancy symptoms

Actual Doctor's Response:
overwashing or the use of astringents that are too harsh will further increase oil production. make sure that your astringents are non-drying and paraben- and alcohol-free. also your moisturizer should be non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging). use moisturizers that are derived from natural oils such as almond or avocado oils.

dry skin is common as we age but conditions such as eczema and psoriasis can also lead to extremely dry and cracked skin. applying a daily moisturizers especially after showering limiting showing time and bathing in warm & not hot water help. one major tip is to use skin products that contain petroleum or lanolin. these help seal moisture in the skin. they also produce a barrier that protects against the loss of natural oils within the skin. if the symptoms persist despite these simple tips and a change in your routine it's time to see a dermatologist. a history and physical is what a dermatologist will look at to determine the cause. occasionally other tests such as a thyroid panel or vitamin d level may be needed.

taking care of baby's skin is the first step to managing infant eczema especially when the condition is mild. try: moisturizers. a good moisturizing ointment such as petroleum jelly or fragrance-free creams when used daily will help baby's skin retain its natural moisture. apply immediately after a bath. a lukewarm bath. this helps hydrate and cool the skin and may reduce itching. speak with your pediatrician about using an antihistamine to help relieve your baby's itchy skin. topical steroids. over-the-counter steroids such as hydrocortisone creams and ointments can help reduce the redness and inflammation of baby's eczema when used as directed. though these creams are safe they can lead to thinned skin and other issues if applied for too many days to the same part of the body. other topical treatments are available by prescription to ease inflammation. speak with your pediatrician. in severe cases of eczema in children skin care can be complemented with: ultraviolet light therapy. antibiotics for rashes that become infected.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9365
hi this is from webmd it’s the part just for you to read. bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the organisms (flora) that naturallyexist in the vagina. normally about 95% of vaginal flora are lactobacillus bacteria. (these types are unique to humans different from the lactobacillus in yogurt. ) these lactobacilli help keep the vaginal ph level low and prevent overgrowth of other types of organisms. women with bacterial vaginosis have fewer lactobacillus organisms than normal and more of other types of bacteria. experts do not yet understand what causes this imbalance. although the specific cause isn't known a number of health and lifestyle factors have been linked to bacterial vaginosis things that increase your risk of getting bacterial vaginosis include: having more than one sex partner or having a new sex partner. smoking. douching. not using condoms. although bacterial vaginosis can be triggered by or get worse from sexual activity it does not appear to be an infection that is passed from man to woman. so experts do not consider bacterial vaginosis to be a male-female sexually transmitted infection. bacterial vaginosis may be passed from woman to woman during sexual contact. do hope it helps you. good luck

hi here's a link that should answer the first part of your question. <link> just copy this into google to the www. to open and read. small vessel disease this is mainly caused by plaque build up and from plaque you also get high cholesterol so this post of mine below if you really get into this and trust it it will clear away your plaque over time its well worth it for your heart and health. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 small teaspoonful each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. don’t forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on.

we know that untreated chlamydia can lead to many problems including pid and scarring of the fallopian tubes (this can cause a tubal pregnancy) but it would not be possible to determine your "chances" of this happening. i would strongly suggest that any future partner(s) use condoms 100% of the time and that you be routinely tested for chlamydia and other stds that may have accompanied this sexually-transmitted disease.

many people have questions about how to use lubricant for more comfortable pleasurable sex. here are some tips you might consider: 1. choose the right lubricant for the right situation. water-based lubricant and silicone-based lubricant are well suited for latex condoms (oil-based products such as olive oil oil-based lubricants or massage oil can cause latex condoms to tear). silicone-based lubricants are better suited for sex play in the bath shower or hot tub as water-based lubricants will wash away. 2. apply the lubricant to your or your partner's fingertips for more careful application and less chance of spilling it onto the bed or floor. 3. next use your or your partner's fingers to apply the lubricant to the parts that need to 'fit together" well such as around a woman's vaginal opening or on a man's penis. if you're using lubricant for sex toy play consider applying some lubricant to the sex toy as well. 4. water-based lubricant is easily absorbed into the body so if sex goes on for some time water-based lubricant may need to be re-applied. small dabs of water can also help to re-activate the lubricant. . are you having problems with seepage or drilling? tactical oilfield products are the best products for reducing friction smoother drilling and controlling lost circulation in see pages.

Patient Question:
my primary doctor diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed xanax and zoloft. why do i still have panic attacks?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing "bridge therapy" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!

why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking. no phlem. wakes me up at night. night and morning only.

Actual Doctor's Response:
good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!

because a tampon in the vagina also exerts pressure on the urethra (the tube where urine passes out of the body) it can act as a kind of “stopper. ” this may help control leaks drips and dribbles. doctors say it’s okay to use this method once in a while — for example if you tend to “leak” urine while exercising. however steve goldstein md professor of obstetrics and gynecology at nyu medical center in new york city warns not to make a habit of it and says to remove the tampon as soon as you’re done working out. a tampon inside a dry vagina he says can cause significant irritation as well as microscopic tears in the skin. the irritation and tears can later open the door to infection. to help control everyday leaks drips and dribbles you can use one of the new ultra thin incontinence pads. they are more absorbent than a typical menstrual pad and safer than a tampon.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it would be highly unlikely that pregnancy could occur from the scenerio that you described. there are many things that cause a delay in the menses including stress. because you both are engaging in intimate sexual activity it may only be a matter of time before you both decide to go the rest of the way and have vaginal sex. i would strongly suggest that you use condoms and that your girlfriend be on another form of effective birth control.

well i'd sure like to hear the backstory on this one. you're referring to the als association "ice bucket challenge " i presume? the one where people pour a bucket of ice water over their heads and donate money to the als association? if that's what we're talking about then i would cautiously answer your question with a "no " while also stating i'm not a doctor and cannot give medical advice. i'm betting you're asking this question because someone poured a bucket of ice water over their head and then fainted. this would not be uncommon and i'm surprised we haven't heard of it happening before. why would dumping a bucket of ice water over your head possibly cause you to faint? it's called " the vagal effect. " dunking your face in icy water causes your heart rate to suddenly slow way down. this is often referred to as the "diving reflex. " if the heart rate slows suddenly you can pass out. usually this lasts for only a few moments. it is not an indication of an underlying heart problem. interestingly you can also faint by holding your breath and bearing down hard to push out a bowel movement -- another way to suddenly slow your heart rate down. think about that before you try to rush your bowels in the bathroom next time. wishing you well!

lyrica was the first medicine approved by the fda for treating fibromyalgia pain. it is indicated for fibromyalgia pain and is felt to work by decreasing the pain signal intensity at the spinal cord level. one of the possible side effects is drowsiness which can affect the sleep but it's not approved as a sleep med. please work with your doctor to determine benefits and side effects of any of your meds and whether it's best for you to continue them. when i started on lyrica (about 2 years ago now) it took approximately 3 months for my symptoms to truly see improvement. they went away gradually over time for me. lyrica is a drug that requires "building up" in the system and maintaining a certain level in order to continue being effective. that's why they warn you not to miss doses or take double doses in the papers that come with it. give it a little more time but if you don't see any improvement in 3-6 months you will definitely need to revisit with your doctor!

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are no "legal requirements". the doctor sets his own rules and parameters when it comes to refills of chronic medications. many clinicians will let you go a year; others six months. while it can be a hassle and added expense to see your medical provider they are responsible for your care. having you come in is a good opportunity to give you a check-up see about your health maintenence that you may be ignoring (blood tests cancer screenings etc. ). make the appointment and discuss this directly with the doctor. not the office manager. ask for a one-year prescription of all of your meds if he is willing.

it could be both. yeast infections in the vagina tend to itch; urinary infections tend to be painful with urination only and can be accompanied by the urge to urinate even after you have urinated. see your medical provider for a urinalysis to see if you do indeed have an infection needing to be treated. a vaginal yeast infection can usually be treated over the counter with anti-yeast vaginal medications.

i'm sorry to hear that but don't be alarmed. it's possible to have an "abnormal" ekg result that is actually normal for you. for example some people have an irregular heartbeat that is not dangerous and they have always had such an irregular heartbeat. that would show up on an ekg test as "abnormal " even though it's not dangerous and is in fact normal for that particular individual. your cardiologist or the health care provider who ordered the ekg test should explain to you what "abnormal" means in the context of your overall health. there are many many things that can cause an "abnormal" ekg result so only your doctor can tell you what it means in your specific case. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
what is colitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
colitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the colon and is associated with diarrhea pain and blood in the stool. there are numerous reasons for the colon to become inflamed including: infection. loss of blood supply to the colon. inflammatory bowel disease. invasion of the colon wall with collagen or lymphocytic white blood cells. anatomy of the colon the colon is a hollow muscular tube that receives products of digestion from the small intestine and ultimately eliminates them from the body through the anus. the colon is located in the abdomen and has numerous sections that are named based on their location. colitis can affect different sections of the colon. the colon begins in the right lower abdomen with the cecum (located just above the appendix) into which the products of digestion empty from the small intestine. the ascending portion of the colon then ascends from the lower to the upper right side of the abdomen. it traverses the abdomen as the transverse portion of the colon from the right upper to left upper abdomen before descending from the upper to the lower left side of the abdomen. the last portions of the colon are the sigmoid colon low in the abdomen and finally the anus. the colon also has several layers. the mucosa (inner layer or lining) comes into contact with the products of digestion and fluid and actively removes water and electrolytes to help solidify the feces. a layer of smooth muscle (a special type of muscle) surrounds the inner layer and is responsible for squeezing and mixing the undigested food and transporting it through the length of the colon to the anus.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's entirely possible that the liquid you're referring to is in fact stomach acid. it's not uncommon for reflux to get worse when lying down. did your doctor prescribe something for you to take for the acid reflux? if so and it's not working then i'd suggest you return to the doctor to describe what's going on. he or she may want to change your medication or have you try a mechanical approach to the problem such as elevating the head of your bed on a couple of bricks. you also would be well advised to stop eating within two hours of bedtime. i doubt the symptoms you're describing are related to any heart problem but only your doctor can say for sure. no matter what this issue is having a negative impact on your daily life so you should get it checked out again. best wishes to you!

well my friend it sounds like you are constipated. and on top of that probably have a hemorrhoid yes. that would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement. while i applaud your devotion to greek yogurt i agree it's probably wise to cut back from 8-12 containers per day. eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation. if you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids. first you need to make sure you're drinking plenty of water each day. second eat a fiber-rich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods. in the short term you can take an over-the-counter stool softener (not laxative) such as docusate sodium. please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse. it's not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system. just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two. wishing you well! let me first start by saying i am not a doctor just your fellow webmd follower and i have had crohns disease for 12 years and know a little something about bowel movements. two important questions: my first question is: is the blood red or black? red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning. it either means you need to start drinking more water and/or taking stool softeners. you usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools. my next question would be: if the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor. this means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended. i suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside. again i hate to say it but see a doctor and/or stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will "balance" you. i had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid. my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked. <link>

probably not an annual pap unless you have a family history of uterine or cervical cancer had some risky sexual exposure in the past and are not having any gynecological symptoms. remember that a pap smear is just a test. there are other important components on a pelvic examination that should not be skipped. a pap smear only reveals cervical or endocervical cells that may be cancerous. the pelvic examination can find other abnormalities in the uterus ovaries and pelvic area. like suspicious masses etc. hopefully you are getting a mammogram colonoscopy and other preventative tests needed at your age.

Actual Doctor's Response:
your partner should make a trip to the gynecologist's office to find out what the issue is. many things can cause painful intercourse in women including a yeast infection std and vaginismus. the first step in solving the problem is a physical examination. the gynecologist likely will test for a variety of possible infections before moving on to other potential causes of your partner's painful intercourse. your best bet is to refrain from having sex until an std is ruled out. finger insertion and oral sex both can spread stds like herpes and human papilloma virus (hpv or genital warts). better safe than sorry. once an std has been ruled out keep in mind there are other ways to enjoy the intimacy of sex without insertion. until your partner can resolve the pain issue you can show your love for her by suggesting the two of you enjoy intimacy without pressuring her to have intercourse. wishing you both well!

can hypothyroidism cause premature menopause? . i have hypothyroidism and i am almost 40. my doctor thinks i might be going through the early stages of premature menopause. i have read that hypothyroidism can cause it. is this true?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop quickly over a few days to weeks and are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia). early symptoms may be overlooked especially if the person has recently had an illness such as influenza (flu). early symptoms include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. some young children who have learned to use the toilet may start wetting the bed during naps or at night. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. weight loss. increased hunger (possibly). sometimes the blood sugar level rises excessively before a person knows something is wrong. because insulin is not available the cells in the body are unable to get the sugar (glucose) they need for energy. the body begins to break down fat and muscle for energy. when fat is used for energy ketones -or fatty acids-are produced and enter the bloodstream causing the chemical imbalance diabetic ketoacidosis. this is a life-threatening condition. symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis are: flushed hot dry skin. loss of appetite abdominal pain and vomiting. a strong fruity breath odor. rapid deep breathing. restlessness drowsiness difficulty waking up confusion or coma. young children may lack interest in their normal activities. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
what causes hyperthyroidism?

Actual Doctor's Response:
some common causes of hyperthyroidism include: graves' disease. functioning adenoma ("hot nodule") and toxic multinodular goiter (tmng). excessive intake of thyroid hormones. abnormal secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). excessive iodine intake. graves' disease graves' disease which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in this condition the thyroid gland usually is renegade which means it has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via tsh. graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men. graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. these antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi antibodies) thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) and tsh receptor antibodies. graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard nuclear medicine thyroid scan which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively-labeled iodine. in addition a blood test may reveal elevated tsi levels. functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter the thyroid gland (like many other areas of the body) becomes lumpier as we get older. in the majority of cases these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. occasionally a nodule may become "autonomous " which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation via tsh and produces thyroid hormones independently. this becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. when there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones it is called a functioning nodule. if there is more than one functioning nodule the term toxic multinodular goiter is used. functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan. excessive intake of thyroid hormones taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss. these patients can be identified by having a low uptake of radioactively-labelled iodine (radio-iodine) on a thyroid scan. abnormal secretion of tsh a tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). this leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. this condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. to identify this disorder an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of tsh. thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). this condition is associated with a fever and a sore throat that is often painful on swallowing. the thyroid gland is also tender to the touch. there may be generalized neck aches and pains. inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan. excessive iodine intake the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. an excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. certain medications such as amiodarone (cordarone) which is used in the treatment of heart problems contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.

graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. graves' disease causes the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. graves' disease like many thyroid problems often runs in families. other common causes include: thyroid nodules. thyroid nodules are abnormal growths in the thyroid gland that can make too much thyroid hormone. for more information see the topic thyroid nodules. thyroiditis. thyroiditis occurs when your body makes antibodies that damage your thyroid gland. you can also get thyroiditis from a viral or bacterial infection. at first thyroiditis may cause your thyroid levels to rise as hormone leaks out from the damaged gland. later levels may be low ( hypothyroidism ) until the gland repairs itself. uncommon causes of hyperthyroidism include tumors or eating foods or taking medicines that contain large amounts of iodine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

type 1 diabetes develops because the body's defense system ( immune system ) tells the body to destroy the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. it's not known what causes this immune response. some people inherit the risk for type 1 diabetes. but even these people may not develop type 1 diabetes unless other factors such as exposure to certain viral infections are present. in infants and children the beta cells usually are destroyed rapidly resulting in a sudden rise in blood sugar level and a sudden onset of diabetes symptoms. in adults the cells often are destroyed more slowly resulting in a slower rise in blood sugar level and a slower onset of diabetes symptoms. certain genes make a person more susceptible while other genes seem to protect the person from the disease. a complex interaction between a person's genes and some environmental factors such as having enteroviral infections -especially coxsackie b infections-may increase the risk of developing the disease but it does not mean that the person will definitely develop the disease. in the past experts thought that vaccines caused diabetes. but studies have found no link between getting a vaccination and getting type 1 diabetes. 2 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

with the high prevalence of heart disease links between lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity are undergoing extensive research. the original research into caffeine's role in this epidemic resulted in conflicting answers. some evidence suggests an elevation in stress hormones from caffeine consumption that could pose a cardiovascular risk but recent research has shown no relationship between caffeine ingestion and heart disease. in fact studies have actually shown a protective effect against heart disease with habitual intake of caffeinated beverages in the elderly population. the reason for the discrepancy may be due to the kind of beverage being consumed. studies have shown that coffee and tea were not associated with increases in blood pressure or arrhythmias while soft drinks were. research also showed that decaffeinated coffee and tea did not provide the same benefits as the caffeinated versions. the well-respected framingham heart study examined all potential links between caffeine intake and cardiovascular disease and found no harmful effects from drinking coffee. there can however be exceptions to this. people react differently to caffeine and some may experience elevations in blood pressure or arrhythmias. the blood pressure elevations are said to be short lived lasting no more than several hours and are comparable to modest elevations experienced climbing a flight of stairs. it's always best to check with your physician if you are experiencing any side effects.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if your penis is only slightly bent it will not interfere with sexual activity. without having an exact diagnosis it would be very premature to know if there was a treatment or cure; you would need to be examined by a urologist first. there is a condition called peyronie's disease that you can read about that involves a bend in the penis during erections. i don't know if you have this particular condition or not since you have had this condition apparently from birth.

your birth control pills will also prevent pregnancy something that i think you are definitely going to need if you continue with this risky sex-play it is only a matter of time before you both decide to "go for it" so why not carefully plan for the inevitable? spotting or a milky discharge can be many things from a minor vaginal injury (from that rubbing) and your own vaginal mucous. it could be a yeast infection if you are also having itching or irritation. see your medical provider if you are concerned. ejaculation on or near the vaginal opening is a bit risky. while it is not very likely you got pregnant this time since you are on the pill and the ejaculation was not vaginal you want to really avoid as much live viable sperm as you can. you really can't trust your partner during these heated moments of passion so must make him use a condom even if you have not consented to going "all the way". this will contain his semen. if you have a normal period and no signs of pregnancy you won. this time but please keep in mind that thiings could change. be prepared and be pro-active.

as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). that’s the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.

"lockjaw" is a common term for tetanus infection. if you believe you or someone you know has tetanus you need to call 911 immediately. luckily tetanus is very rare in the united states due to immunization programs. tetanus is caused by a bacterium called clostridium tetani that is often found in dirt soil and animal waste. a person can develop tetanus from an unclean wound (especially from dirty metal such as the old scenario of "stepping on a rusty nail") or from sharing needles when injecting illicit drugs. it's important to remember to get a tetanus booster shot every 10 years as an adult to keep your immunization up to date. other conditions can cause a problem that might be characterized as "lockjaw. " these include muscle spasms of the jaw temporomandibular joint disorders and other things. however if you have any of the symptoms of tetanus (notably: headache trouble swallowing) and you have been experienced a dirty wound shared needles with someone or have any other risk factors for developing tetanus then i urge you to seek medical attention. better to discover your problem is simply mechanical or related to a temporomandibular joint disorder than to risk a tetanus infection. wishing you all the best!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry this has been bothering you because there's really nothing you need to do regarding your diastolic blood pressure. let me explain. when we measure blood pressure we write it as one number over another: 140/80. the top number 140 is called the "systolic" pressure. the bottom number 80 is called the " diastolic " pressure. we often describe systolic pressure as the pressure inside your blood vessels at the moment the heart squeezes and pushes blood into the arteries. this is the type of pressure that can cause damage to organs and tiny vessels. when we talk about "high blood pressure" or " hypertension " we are mainly referring to the systolic pressure. we often describe diastolic blood pressure as the pressure of the blood "at rest" in the vessels in between heart beats. even when diastolic pressure is "elevated" above normal it generally is not considered a threat to health. in fact with hypertension diastolic pressure almost always rises and falls along with systolic pressure. what's important with your blood pressure numbers is this: they are both trending downward. that is what we always like to see in a person with high blood pressure. so you are doing well! give yourself a pat on the back and stop worrying about getting your diastolic numbers any lower. you're doing a great job. wishing you well!

how common is atopic dermatitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and is becoming more common. it affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children and its onset decreases substantially with age. scientists estimate that 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. onset after age 30 is less common and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. people who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. about 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9738
atopic dermatitis affects each child differently both in terms of onset and severity of symptoms. in infants atopic dermatitis typically begins around 6 weeks to 12 weeks of age. it may first appear around the cheeks and chin as a patchy facial rash which can progress to red scaling oozing skin. the skin may become infected. once the infant becomes more mobile and begins crawling exposed areas such as the knees and elbows may also be affected. an infant with atopic dermatitis may be restless and irritable because of the itching and discomfort. many infants improve by 18 months of age although they remain at greater than normal risk for dry skin or hand eczema later in life. in childhood the rash tends to occur behind the knees and inside the elbows on the sides of the neck and on the wrists ankles and hands. often the rash begins with papules that become hard and scaly when scratched. the skin around the lips may be inflamed and constant licking of the area may lead to small painful cracks. severe cases of atopic dermatitis may affect growth and the child may be shorter than average. the disease may go into remission (disease-free period). the length of a remission varies and it may last months or even years. in some children the disease gets better for a long time only to come back at the start of puberty when hormones stress and the use of irritating skin care products or cosmetics may cause the condition to flare. although a number of people who developed atopic dermatitis as children also experience symptoms as adults it is less common (but possible) for the disease to show up first in adulthood. the pattern in adults is similar to that seen in children; that is the disease may be widespread or limited. in some adults only the hands or feet may be affected and become dry itchy red and cracked. sleep patterns and work performance may be affected and longterm use of medications to treat the condition may cause complications. adults with atopic dermatitis also have a predisposition toward irritant contact dermatitis especially if they are in occupations involving frequent hand wetting hand washing or exposure to chemicals. some people develop a rash around their nipples. these localized symptoms are difficult to treat and people often do not tell their doctor because of modesty or embarrassment. adults may also develop cataracts that are difficult to detect because they cause no symptoms. therefore the doctor may recommend regular eye exams.

Actual Doctor's Response:
none of the major health organizations emphasize good or bad triglycerides -- the study you found was from 2002 and i have found nothing more recent to support it. the key is to think of heart disease risk like a puzzle with many different pieces. risk factors include high triglycerides high total cholesterol high ldl (bad cholesterol) and low hdl (good cholesterol) high blood pressure hyperglycemia and abdominal fat. someone with metabolic syndrome has a cluster of all these risk factors (instead of just one or two) putting them at even higher risk. for more on how to lower triglycerides see this article and for more on optimal blood lipid levels see this one. good luck!

the actual minimal number of calories that you can safely eat long term depends on your basal metabolic rate (bmr) which is the energy necessary for your body and its organs to maintain normal function while simply at rest. although there are equations to calculate bmr such as the harris-benedict equation these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary. there are other more accurate methods to calculate your bmr through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and co2 production. you could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if you’re genuinely curious otherwise the bmr equations might give you a good enough estimate. you’re correct in stating that 1 200 calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and i think that it’s fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population (again your actual number will vary). by far however 800 calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet (vlcd) because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories. this type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who don’t have proper medical supervision. your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a vlcd and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet. it’s important to note that although vlcds have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity-related conditions like hypertension diabetes or high cholesterol in obese individuals; they don’t seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term. you will likely regain any weight loss after going off the vlcd unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential.

Actual Doctor's Response:
chickenpox is a common childhood skin disease caused by a viral infection. the virus involved is called the varicella-zoster virus. today chickenpox is less common in the united states due to universal vaccination with the varicella virus vaccine though it still occurs in populations that are not routinely vaccinated. varicella-zoster virus is often categorized with the other common so-called "viral exanthems" (viral rashes) such as measles (rubeola) german measles (rubella) fifth disease (parvovirus b19) mumps virus and roseola (human herpesvirus 6) but these viruses are unrelated except for their tendency to cause rashes. in unimmunized populations most people contract chickenpox by age 15 the majority between ages 5 and 9 but all ages can contract it. chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and very young infants than children. winter and spring are the most common times of the year for chickenpox to occur.

hi at 219 your high borderline above you say shrimp but just how much and how you eat it. shrimp can be part of a heart-healthy diet if it is prepared correctly. avoid fried shrimp and creamy high-fat sauces and opt for steamed baked or grilled shrimp instead. if you are battling high cholesterol talk to your physician before including shrimp in your diet. this above was from www. livestrong. com have a read of this just google natural ways out of high cholesterol but even some good walking 3 to 4 times a week will help you but this is good brisk walking and getting off any saturated fats try getting a mix of cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic into you daily i do and take it first thing every morning just after i get up may sound a bit odd but you get no heart burn doing that take that then go for a short walk you will feel it going round your system try this. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 small teaspoonful each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonfuls and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. no if you read up about all three the very good for your heart garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. so do hope this helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
pain left side below the rib cage & above the hip bone hunger pains eating helps but still pain lots of gas. age 61 pain for 6 months had colonoscopy before that no symptoms also had robotic hysterectomy (40 days) ago (drs thought ovarian cancer scare) pain persists. what is on the left side of the body below the rib cage & above hip bone actually hurts to lie on the left side like laying on a rocks. . . . help. .

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish i could tell you what's causing your pain but there are many possibilities. there are no bodily organs in the area you describe. there are only small intestine and the colon. if you are eating and drinking passing gas and having bowel movements those are all good signs your colon is working well. an ovarian cyst can cause pain like you describe and so could healing after a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. as scar tissue forms inside it can contract and be quite painful. this usually clears up over time. the area can indeed feel "lumpy" inside where sutures have been placed. this too should go away with time. i suggest you contact your gynecologist about the pain. he or she is in a better position to give you an opinion about the cause because s/he knows your complete medical history. you have a right to have your pain controlled. this may not mean you have no pain at all. but on a 0-10 scale where 0 is no pain you should be able to aim for pain in the 3-4 range. if your pain is worse than that (and it sounds like it is) contact your doctor for better management of the situation. wishing you well!

is it safe to "push through" fibromyalgia pain? . every time i even attempt to do any sort of exercise the pain doesn't really allow me to do anything. i used to be an athlete many years ago and i would just push through the pain or keep going until the pain went away. i haven't been able to work for years since my accident and fibromyalgia and it is very frustrating. . i am wondering if i can do any damage to my body if i push through the pain? . is it safe to force my body to work through the pain and attempt exercise?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it. if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks. i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want. but there are painful consequences. it could cause you to be unable to do anything. i just know that "pacing yourself" is the watch word here. pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life. it's harder to do than say and requires practice. we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities. i hope this help. start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up. i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non-contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about. good luck hope this helps. and do not forget to stretch!

can a multivitamin cause acne?

Actual Doctor's Response:
no multivitamins will not cause acne. the most common cause of acne is your own hormones. they most definitely will. i think it has to do with the biotin in my multivitamin. before my multivitamin i started taking biotin to think it would make my hair and nails longer and my face glow. boy was i wrong! i've never had such bad acne in my life - to the point of cystic acne! it was embarrassing and painful! happy to say that as soon as i stopped taking it my face returned to normal and i was never so pleased with my own skin before! a couple months later (i completely forgot about the biotin incident) my mother mentioned how i should take a multivitamin since i'm a vegetarian and don't get all the nutrients i need. so silly me - "yeah sure mom grab a bottle for me! it'll be great! " i didn't even look at the label and about 2-3 weeks into taking half a pill every-other day i started to break out like crazy on the left side of my face mostly my cheek. at first i thought it was due to stress but no way it was because of the multivitamin. i also researched it some b vitamins and iodine are two other big causes of acne. "grrrreat their all bundled up in the little capsule to destroy my face! " moral of the story be weary multivitamins sound appealing but can be toxic (even in small doses)! no. multivitamin does not cause acne.

Patient Question:
i have a question about what happened to my dad. he died on 11/7 from a gangrene infection. . he had colon cancer (stage iv)with a small tumor in the intestine (no blockage) and several metastases on his liver. he had been taking chemo with avastin. we took him to the hospital because he had shortness of breath turned out he had fluid in his lungs and abdomen. how did the gangrene occur? does the fluid block circulation? and why didn't the hospital notice a severe infection like that? how does a person who had no wounds get gangrene and why they would just let him languish?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm so sorry you lost your dad. i lost my dad a couple of years ago. i completely understand your wanting answers about how he died. perhaps the best answer is this: medicine doesn't know everything. we can't keep people from dying. it's no comfort to know that but it's true. from a pathophysiology standpoint i can tell you this: if your dad had metastases (spread of the cancer) on his liver the chances are good he had them elsewhere including the lungs. a doctor once described cancer to me this way: it's similar to starting a row of dominoes tumbling. once cells turn cancerous in one place they begin to turn cancerous in many other places in a domino effect. that means your dad may have had metastases to his lungs and other vital organs as well as his liver. how did the gangrene occur? well i can't tell you that exactly. gangrene is an infection and infections definitely can occur without any wounds. fluid build-up can cause an infection. gangrene may have been the cause of your father's death but another likely culprit is sepsis. sepsis occurs when an infection overwhelms the body's immune system and shuts down all the organs. sepsis frequently is the cause of death in people with pneumonia and other conditions. i'm sorry you feel the hospital allowed your father to languish. i'm sorry he passed away. i hope you are proud that he fought until the very end. i wish i had answers for you. i wish i could take the pain away. i hope you know i sincerely share your pain over this loss. my sympathy to you and your family.

most helpful answer yes you definitely could have gotten pregnant. you should be alert for a missed period because if you are pregnant you should remove the nuvaring as soon as possible after you know positively you're carrying a baby. like any other type of hormonal birth control method (such as birth control pills) the nuvaring typically takes a month to be considered fully effective. since you didn't wait for the required amount of time before having unprotected sex it's possible for you to have become pregnant. that said it's less typical to become pregnant while you're on your period. a woman is most fertile (likely to become pregnant) a couple of days before her body releases an egg (ovulates). while that time frame is different for every woman it generally occurs around days 13-15 for a woman with a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. the answer to your question then is: it's possible but not likely you got pregnant when you had unprotected sex the same day you inserted the nuvaring. if you ever have questions about your birth control method you can always ask your pharmacist or your gynecologist. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
what's the link between a common cold and obesity?

Actual Doctor's Response:
feed a fever starve a cold… gain a few pounds? new research from rady children’s hospital in san diego published in the journal pediatrics sheds new light on the possible relationship between obesity and the common cold. this small study of 124 kids tested for antibodies to a particular form of adenovirus which can cause colds and diarrhea. fifteen percent of the kids had antibodies to the virus suggested that they had been exposed to it previously. but the interesting thing was that on average kids who tested positive for the virus were fifty pounds heavier than kids who had not gotten this strain of the common cold. and even when the obese kids were studied separately the antibody-positive group was 35 pounds heavier than the obese children who had not been exposed to the virus. so it appears as though there may be a link between infection with a cold virus and obesity. now what? do we steer our efforts away from diet and exercise and more toward hand washing and vaccine development? not so fast although it’s an intriguing new direction. healthy lifestyle choices and education are the best tools we currently have to prevent obesity in our kids — and ourselves for that matter. but research like this continues to flush out the role that inflammation can have in disease processes and potentially disease management. years ago we started thinking about cardiovascular disease in a similar way. we knew that cholesterol-rich plaque deposited in blood vessel walls was ultimately responsible for heart attacks but we still didn’t understand how it got there. people latched onto diet as one modifiable contributor — hence recommendations to eat more fish and less saturated fat. but our understanding has evolved to a point where we recognize that inflammation has a critical role in determining who gets atherosclerosis. at one point we even identified a higher prevalence of anti-chlamydial antibodies in individuals with heart disease. this led to studies of using antibiotics as a possible preventive measure but unfortunately it didn’t really work. but the concept of inflammation continues to guide future research and has even steered our thinking regarding how diet may be playing a role. understanding inflammation will likely be one of the keys to understand heart disease and how it can be prevented. it’s fascinating to think that childhood obesity — and possibly other chronic disease processes — will fall under a similar umbrella. speaking of umbrellas it may turn out that walking outdoors with wet hair is worse for you than we thought.

this could be nutritional and a lack of protein could be contributing. it sounds like the nutritional supplements you are taking contain vitamins and minerals that can help with hair growth. however after weight loss surgery a lack of protein in the diet can contribute to hair loss. you need to talk to your doctor to determine the best ways for you to get more protein -- and to determine if that might be the cause. you should eat a variety of types of protein including meat beans eggs rice etc.

Patient Question:
how is the source of nausea or vomiting diagnosed?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the health care provider will try to find the underlying illness that is causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. at the same time steps will be taken to treat the symptoms and prevent dehydration. any testing will likely be directed to finding the underlying diagnosis. however blood tests may be taken to assess whether the electrolyte balance in the body has been disturbed due to dehydration from continued vomiting. a urinalysis may be done. concentrated urine is associated with dehydration as the kidneys try to hold onto water in the body. ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9806
symptomatic treatment may occur while the underlying illness is being investigated because ideally nausea and vomiting should resolve when the cause of the symptoms resolves. nausea and vomiting are often made worse when the patient is dehydrated resulting in a vicious cycle. the nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid making the dehydration worse which then increases the nausea. intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue. there are a variety of antinausea medications (antiemetics) that may be prescribed. they can be administered in different ways depending upon the patient's ability to take them. medications are available by pill liquid or tablets that dissolve on or under the tongue by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by rectal suppository. common medications used to control nausea and vomiting include promethazine (phenergan) prochlorperazine (compazine) droperidol (inapsine) metoclopramide (reglan) and ondansetron (zofran). the decision as to which medication to use will depend on the specific situation.

how do i treat severe heartburn?

Actual Doctor's Response:
when severe heartburn and acid reflux happen nearly all the time it could be gerd or gastroesophageal reflux disease. with chronic heartburn your doctor may prescribe a procedure called an endoscopy that allows the specialist to look inside your esophagus to see whether acid reflux has eroded the delicate lining of your esophagus or caused other damage. here are a few self-care tips: eat smaller meals well before bedtime. avoid triggers such as caffeine and spicy foods. cut back on alcohol and caffeine. stop smoking. lose weight if you're overweight. cut back on aspirin and pain relievers if you take them often. if diet and lifestyle changes don't work you might try: over-the-counter antacids such as maalox rolaids and tums. they may not be as effective for chronic heartburn. acid blockers like axid pepcid tagamet and zantac last longer and can be effective for several hours at a time says the aga. drugs called proton pump inhibitors or ppis. they shut down tiny proton pumps in the stomach that produce acid lowering acid levels dramatically. one ppi prilosec is available over the counter. reglan is a prescription drug that works to stop acid reflux by speeding up how quickly your stomach empties. faster digestion means less heartburn. gaviscon an over-the-counter heartburn treatment works as both an antacid and a foam barrier where your esophagus empties into the top of your stomach.

how long is mono contagious?

Actual Doctor's Response:
infectious mononucleosis or “mono” is caused by epstein-barr virus (ebv) a member of the herpes virus family. it’s spread during close physical contact mostly through transmission of saliva. (that’s pretty close earning mono its nickname “kissing disease. ”) ninety percent to 95% of people in the u. s. eventually are infected by ebv although not all of them develop full-blown mononucleosis. people can transmit ebv to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. in studies many people continue to have ebv in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. that’s why most people who get mononucleosis don’t remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. it’s also possible to periodically shed ebv virus in one’s saliva throughout life without having symptoms. it’s not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. fever sore throat fatigue and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. the worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks but fatigue can last for months. vetsika ek. expert reviews in molecular medicine 2004; vol 6(23): pp 1-16. fafi-kremer s. journal of infectious disease 2005; vol 191(6): pp 985-989.

herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .

Actual Doctor's Response:
you have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens. for example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice. when we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again. that said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible. in the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body. we even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place: 'genital herpes' or 'cold sore' or 'whitlow' (on the finger or hand). though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites. in other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection. if reinfection does (unusually) happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals. if reinfection does take place (and i stress it is rare) then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip. around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences. let's not get hysterical about the common cold sore. shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter. by its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies.

unfortunately you can. genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance. and it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions. this is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern. you have most likely seen many people with cold sores/or fever blisters. these are typically type 1 herpes lesions but you can get type 2 lesions (genital types) on your mouth. with that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks. theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility. the fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem. if one of you has active lesions i am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your to-do list at least until you are better. are you both taking suppression drugs? these are daily anti-herpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks.

Actual Doctor's Response:
update from original post. saw ent had biopsy done and ct scan. biopsy was negative for cancer. swelling by ear is gone and one in neck is somewhat smaller. the ent wants me to have the lymph node (neck) removed and biopsied. i'm not in good health have intractable facial nerve pain from dental procedure (going thru nerve blocks for that) among other conditions. i want to wait on removing the lymph node as none of the tests showed a definitive problem. need some advice. probably will ask for a second opinion.

Patient Question:
how is atherosclerosis treated?

Actual Doctor's Response:
once a blockage is there it's generally there to stay. with medication and lifestyle changes though plaques may slow or stop growing. they may even shrink slightly with aggressive treatment. lifestyle changes: reducing the lifestyle risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis will slow or stop the process. that means a healthy diet exercise and no smoking. medication:taking drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure will slow and perhaps even halt the progression of atherosclerosis as well as lower your risk of heart attacks and stroke. using invasive techniques doctors can also open up blockages from atherosclerosis or go around them: angiography and stenting: cardiac catheterization with angiography of the coronary arteries is the most common angiography procedure performed. angioplasty (catheters with balloon tips) and stenting can often open up a blocked artery. bypass surgery: surgeons "harvest" a healthy blood vessel (often from the leg or chest). they use the healthy vessel to bypass a segment blocked by atherosclerosis. these procedures involve a risk of complications. they are usually saved for people with significant symptoms or limitations caused by atherosclerosis.

Patient Question:
i am eligible for medicare in may 2014. i currently have no health insurance. am i required to sign up for the aca?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer under the law you can go without health insurance for up to three consecutive months without facing a penalty. since you're not eligible for medicare until may you will exceed that limit. the penalty is applied to each month you're uninsured. for 2014 the clock doesn't start until april 1. in your case therefore you're only skipping coverage for one month that is subject to the penalty. the penalty is the greater of $95 or 1% of your annual income. so you'll pay 1/12 of the yearly penalty -- it's likely to be a very small amount and no doubt much less expensive than buying insurance. however going without health insurance is a huge risk. if you're injured or diagnosed with an illness between now and may you're completely on your own with regard to the medical bills you'll incur.

unfortunately georgia is one of the states that did not expand their medicaid program. as written the affordable care act required all states to expand their medicaid program for people up to 138% of the federal poverty level (about $16 000) with the federal government paying the full share of the cost. the supreme court struck down this requirement however and made it optional for states. because your state did not expand its medicaid program you may not be eligible for medicaid (you should still check with your marketplace however to confirm). because your income is so low that you do not need to file taxes you will probably not qualify for a federal subsidy to pay for private insurance either. because the law assumed states would expand their medicaid programs the federal subsidies were only made available for people between 100% and 400% of the poverty level. because you do not file taxes however you will not be subject to any tax penalty for not having insurance. a small consolation i know.

this is a very interesting question to me because i love obscure stuff. i should start by saying there often is no answer to "why" for many weird body occurrences. when medicine can't figure out an answer to "why " they call the situation "idiopathic. " this basically means "of unknown origin. " then too sometimes these weird symptoms actually are normal. in your case for instance if your toes have always itched at night then that probably is just normal for you. who knows why? maybe there's something unique about the way the nerves in your toes function. there are certain conditions that can produce the symptom you describe though. one of these is raynaud's phenomenon. in raynaud's blood flow to the fingers toes (and the extremities more generally) is disrupted by exposure to cold temperatures. the vessels go into spasm and the tissue lacks oxygen so it burns or itches or feels painful. a rather obscure symptom of raynaud's is itchy toes. of course if you don't have any other symptoms of raynaud's then it's unlikely this is the cause of your symptoms. another obscure possible cause of your symptoms is gout. usually gout presents with a complaint of sharp pain in the big toe especially at night. gout normally causes swelling too. if you don't have nighttime swelling and redness in the toe then it's unlikely gout is the source of your symptoms. i suggest you continue to monitor the situation and record your symptoms in a log book. even if you just write down the dates and times your toes itch it could be helpful to your doctor in arriving at a diagnosis -- if there is one. like i said many times we have no idea what is causing a benign symptom like itchy toes. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
what is hair loss?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are many types of hair loss also called alopecia: gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. more and more hair follicles go into a telogen or resting phase and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. androgenic alopecia is another form of hair loss. it's a genetically predisposed condition that can affect both men and women. men with this condition can begin suffering hair loss as early as their teens or early 20s while most women don't experience noticeable thinning until their 40s or later. in men the condition is also called male pattern baldness. it's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown. in women androgenic alopecia is referred to as female pattern baldness. women with the condition experience a general thinning over the entire scalp with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. patchy hair loss in children and young adults often sudden in onset is known as alopecia areata. this condition may result in complete baldness but in about 90% of cases the hair returns usually within a few years. with alopecia universalis all body hair falls out. tearing out one's own hair a psychological disorder known as trichotillomania is seen most frequently in children. telogen effluvium is hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time causing shedding and subsequent thinning.

there's a reason it's called "common acne" -- nearly everyone suffers from outbreaks of pimples at some point in life. it starts when greasy secretions from the skin's sebaceous glands plug the tiny openings for hair follicles (plugged pores). if the openings are large the clogs take the form of blackheads: small flat spots with centers darkened by exposure to air. if the openings stay small the clogs take the form of whiteheads: small closed flesh-colored bumps. both types of plugged pores can develop into swollen tender inflammations or pimples or deeper lumps or nodules. cysts associated with severe cases of acne (cystic acne) are firm swellings below the skin's surface that become inflamed and sometimes infected. although acne remains largely a curse of adolescence about 20% of all cases occur in adults. acne commonly starts during puberty between the ages of 10 and 13 and tends to be worse in people with oily skin. teenage acne usually lasts for five to 10 years normally going away during the early 20s. it occurs in both sexes although teenage boys tend to have the most severe cases. women are more likely than men to have mild to moderate forms into their 30s and beyond. acne lesions are most common on the face but they can also occur on the neck chest back shoulders and upper arms. acne isn't caused by a harmful diet poor hygiene or an uncontrolled sex drive. the simple truth is that heredity and hormones are behind most forms of acne. swearing off chocolate or scrubbing your face 10 times a day won't change your predisposition to this unsightly sometimes painful and often embarrassing skin problem.

bottle rot is indicated by dark stains around the teeth. but if you are concerned see your local pediatric dentist as soon as possible. the risk of potentially devastating nursing-pattern dental decay exists for the breastfed child just as it does for the bottle-fed child. this kind of decay is caused by extended and repetitive feedings with prolonged exposure of erupted teeth to fermentable carbohydrates. some general recommendations 1. infants should not be put to sleep with a bottle. nocturnal breastfeeding should be avoided after the first primary tooth begins to erupt. 2. parents are encouraged to transition infants into drinking from a cup as they approach their first birthday. infants should be weaned from the bottle between 12 and 14 months of age. 3. consumption of juices from a bottle should be avoided. 4. oral hygiene measures should be implemented by the time of eruption of the first primary tooth. 5. an oral health consultation visit within six months of the eruption of the first tooth is recommended to educate parents and provide anticipatory guidance for prevention of dental disease.

most helpful answer sorry you're going through this. some people are prone to developing sebaceous cysts and it's not a pleasant process to go through. if you are not running a fever you can probably take a wait-and-see attitude toward the situation. (a fever is indicative of an infection though a localized skin infection may not cause much of a fever. ) drainage is good when it comes to cysts so you can try applying very warm compresses to the area to help "draw out" the remaining fluid. the white head you're seeing could be a layer of skin cells re-growing to cover the opening. although you can gently scrub the skin to keep the cyst open we generally discourage people from doing this because you don't want to inadvertently introduce infection to the area. speaking of which you also can apply antibacterial ointment to the area to reduce the chances of the wound becoming infected. it's not unusual for a large sebaceous cyst to take several days to completely drain after it has burst on its own. assuming you're not allergic to any over-the-counter pain remedies you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain. if you continue to have concerns about the cyst or if it emits a smelly greenish pus or if you start running a fever then it's time for a trip to the doctor. it's not necessarily an emergency but i'd recommend you call your primary health care provider if the situation gets worse or doesn't clear up over the next several days. wishing you well!

how do you lose weight if you are supposed to eat 1500 calories but only excerise 300 of it away daily? . i'm just trying to understand the concept of being told that i need to eat a minimum of 1500 calories daily drink 64 ounces of water daily and exercise at least 300 calories daily.

Actual Doctor's Response:
every person burns a certain amount calories at rest along with activities of daily living which is called basal metabolic rate. upping exercise is one way to increase the total amount of calories you burn daily. this webmd page will help you estimate your basal metabolic rate. the key is to monitor how much weight you lose. a safe and steady amount is 1 to 2 pounds per week. good luck!

if a woman has a small prolactinoma there is usually no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. the pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. but damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than 1% of pregnant women with prolactinomas. in women with large tumors the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater. if a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy the likelihood of future successful pregnancies is extremely high. a woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to pregnancy. this evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. as soon as the patient becomes pregnant her doctor will usually advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (parlodel) or cabergoline (dostinex). patients should consult their hormone specialists (endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop – particularly headaches visual changes nausea vomiting excessive thirst or urination or extreme lethargy. bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy.

Patient Question:
how can i treat adult acne?

Actual Doctor's Response:
acne is not caused by dirty skin or by eating sweet or fried foods. acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. the worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly. one would think that as you age you would no longer have issues with acne. however women are especially prone to adult hormonal acne because your androgen levels fluctuate with your monthly cycle. other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. the women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. this form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. this becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin. keeping your face clean is a good beginning and you may want to turn to some of the many acne medications on the market but be aware that these are formulated for severe teen acne and will be very strong. if you wish to try these formulations try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. watch what you put on your face. steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate lanolin lauryl alcohol oleic acid vegetable butters oils and waxes. if over-the-counter acne solutions don't work for you you should make an appointment with your dermatologist. there are prescription medications that can be very helpful to you.

the pregnancy would not survive. the sperm and egg of different species are incompatible. technically a pregnancy may begin but will soon spontaneously terminate. a human has 46 chromosomes with the male and female each contributing 23 chromosomes to their offspring. a horse has 64 chromosomes with the male and female each contributing 32 chromosomes to their offspring. a union between a horse and human would result in a shared chromosome total of 55. therefore the egg recognizes the irrational number of chromosomes and rejects the pregnancy.

Patient Question:
what is the difference between a class 1 and class 2 narcotic?

Actual Doctor's Response:
in the united states narcotics are classified by the drug enforcement administration (dea) into different "schedules" based on several criteria. schedule i substances are defined as drugs with no known medical application and a high potential for abuse. schedule i substances include narcotics like cocaine and heroin. interestingly however marijuana also is classified as a schedule i substance. it remains to be seen if this will change as some states have voted to legalize marijuana and claim it has medicinal properties. schedule ii substances include narcotics that are deemed to have therapeutic benefits yet maintain a high potential for abuse. these include morphine fentanyl and even "mixed amphetamine salts" (the brand name adderall). so basically the difference between schedule i substances and schedule ii is simply in whether or not a drug is deemed to have a valid medical application. hope that clears things up for you! in the u. s. prescription drugs are categorized through the controlled substances act which places drugs into classes or schedules according to the government’s view of potential for abuse. schedule 1 drugs are also referred to as class 1 drugs. drugs that fall under schedule 1 classification are illicit or illegal drugs have no medicinal purpose or use have an increased potential for abuse and if the drug poses a safety issue. narcotics such as lsd heroin and cocaine are all schedule 1 drugs and although two states (colorado and washington) have legalized it and other states allow use for medicinal purposes marijuana is also still classified as a schedule 1 drug. schedule 2 drugs have acceptable medical use and importance an increased potential for dependency abuse and severe addiction. schedule 2 includes opiates with high dose codeine opium morphine oxycodone and fentanyl as well as barbiturates and methamphetamine. schedule 2 drugs also include the adhd drug adderall. the primary difference between a schedule 1 and a schedule 2 drug is whether there is a valid medical purpose for the drug. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article. i have a protein shake which relieves me of that felling of being hungry. protein! most protein shakes are specifically formulated for post workout fuel and also contain other useful ingredients for your muscles and recovery. if you want food cottage cheese tuna oatmeal peanut butter are good examples. you do need to eat before two hours. it is good unless it's liquid item then 1hr is sufficient. as for the hunger after exercising out you will always get hunger after even if you ate before. you burn a lot of calories when you workout and your body wants more. it's fine to eat after you workout. that's one of the few times that carbs are okay. after i workout i drink a carb drink that's 400 calories and 100 carbs. and then i drink my protein shake after that.

i'm sorry to hear this. walking is excellent for your health. except when it causes exhaustion! if this is a new symptom i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for an exam and some blood work. many things can cause these feelings of tiredness from seasonal allergies to anemia. only a medical professional can give you a good answer. if you just started a walking regimen and are feeling tired all day maybe it's because you're overdoing it. try starting with a 10-15 minute walk and then work up to longer time periods as your stamina increases. of course while walking is usually considered safe no one should start an exercise program without their doctor's consent. wishing you all the best!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking!

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. sinus pain can feel so miserable! sinusitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tissue that lines the sinus cavities. this swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain (and sometimes an infection). sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment. i hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have nasal polyps. while polyps aren't extremely common in 14 year olds they're not unheard of. if you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an ear-nose-throat doctor for an exam. meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including: using a vaporizer (warm mist) in your bedroom (be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold) inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot (not boiling) water warm compresses (wash rag soaked in very warm water) laid across the eyes/bridge of the nose saline nose drops (available over the counter) if there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms. if possible spend as much time as you can in a smoke-free environment. because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom pet-free and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly. i hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief!

Patient Question:
i have hurt my inner knee before playing football a 2-3 years ago. now im feeling the same pains again what should i do? . the football injury i had my schools trainer check and she said it was pinched cartalidge. it got really swollen and in 3-4 days it went back down but the pains didnt. the pains happen when i walk especially when putting pressure on my heel. the pain isnt unbearable but it surely is annoying since walking is a huge part of where i need to be.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you will need to see an orthopedist for a thorough examination of your knee and probably an mri of that problematic joint. since this problem has been going on for 2-3 years it is high-time for you to get it checked out medically. the school's trainer may have just guessed and a guess is not a diagnosis.

Patient Question:
i did not believe the second-hand smoke showed positive in a drug screen. does it or not? . my adult grandson is staying with me at this time. he does smoke pot. i have gotten high from only his second hand smoke. by 'high' i mean i fell asleep in my recliner. i have chronic pain and am never without pain. he smoked in same room for two days and i had no pain since i can ever remember. it did not show on a ua. it has been 8+ years since i actually smoked any pot. is there a chance i could show positive even though i do not smoke pot?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it depends on how much came in to your body. if you were breathing the smoke even a little bit you are technically smoking it or breathing it anyway. if it was enough to give you a relief from your pain then it could possibly show up on a test. it could easily be that the small amount you got from second hand smoke was enough to help you but not enough to show on the ua but i'd advise caution if you have to go through those a lot.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it is difficult to assess what is causing your skin irritation. have you been out in the sun without sunscreen? some antiaging products make your skin more susceptible to the sun. you may now require more sunscreen or may have used another substance on your skin (like makeup) that doesn’t mix well with your antiaging cream. typically we suggest that you stop using everything and reintroduce one at a time. you may have used too much. try smaller amounts and see if you can again get the improvements without the irritation. if it persists go to your dermatologist for help. i think over using these creams must have caused the irritation. i would suggest you to use natural products for your skin as they have no side effects on your skin. visit asyana at <link> to know more about these natural tanning products as they keep your skin hydrated.

Patient Question:
i may begin bp medication in the near future. what are the different classes of bp meds and the pros/cons of each.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer this is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider. it's a bit too involved to go into here but i'll briefly outline some (not all) of the options. and luckily webmd offers this handy comparison of some common blood pressure medications. a water pill or diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system. this essentially lowers your overall blood volume. if you have tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) you should talk to your health care provider about using a "potassium-sparing" water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse. ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have become a popular choice. these medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure. these medications usually have few side effects. beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts. this combination causes your blood pressure to come down. if your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions. some beta blockers shouldn't be taken when your pulse rate is low. again you ask a good question for your doctor. if you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does (specifically) why it's a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for. hope this helps!

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9544
although it may not have the fame of herpes or the clap hpv is actually the most common sexually transmitted disease. fifty percent of all men will have it at some point in their lives. in most cases hpv causes no symptoms and doesn’t lead to any health problems. but some strains do cause genital warts. the only way to prevent transmission of the virus is to avoid skin contact. condoms may help reduce transmission but that’s not really clear. the virus has no cure. if you do get genital warts they’re most likely to appear on the head of your penis. they can also show up elsewhere including your anus. while they may fade on their own they can also be treated with creams or surgery. hpv does raise the risk of getting cancers of the anus and penis -- however those risks are still extremely low.

Patient Question:
is there a correlation between hair loss and stress?

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes definitely chronic stress or other emotional factors may lead to hormonal changes and trigger hair loss. you may see a sudden hair loss pattern associated with stress. this can also signal an underlying medical condition that may require immediate treatment.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
both emotional and physical stress (such as a serious illness or recovery from surgery) have been associated with hair loss. it is possible that stress induces hormonal changes that are responsible for the hair loss since hair loss is a known consequence of other hormonal changes due to pregnancy thyroid disturbances or even from taking oral contraceptives. nervous habits such as scalp rubbing or hair twisting or pulling may also be responsible for hair loss. these habits may be responses to psychological stress in some people and may be another cause of stress-related hair loss. excessive hair-pulling is a form of impulse-control disorder medically referred to as trichotillomania. the hair loss from hormonal changes often disappears after a period of months to two years. as with other stress-related symptoms learning and practicing effective stress-management techniques can help reduce the severity of the symptoms.

if you have a fairly regular 28 day cycle a period due on 25th of may would indicate ovulation was expected to be around 11th of may. the 4th of may is 7 days before that but sperm only live about 4 days (at most 5 days) while swimming around searching for the egg. pregnancy would seem unlikely but it all depends on the regularity of your cycle and your certainty about the dates provided.

exactly how much exercise is needed to lower cholesterol has been a matter of some debate. in general most public health organizations recommend at a minimum 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise such as walking jogging biking or gardening. but a 2002 study by researchers at duke university medical center found that more intense exercise is actually better than moderate exercise for lowering cholesterol. people who exercised vigorously also raised their levels of hdl -- the "good" kind of lipoprotein that helps clear cholesterol from the blood. "we found it requires a good amount of high intensity exercise to significantly change hdl " says william kraus md an assistant professor of medicine at duke and lead author on the study. even though moderate exercise was not as effective in reducing ldl -- the "bad" cholesterol -- or increasing hdl it did keep cholesterol levels from rising.

Patient Question:
how is colitis diagnosed?

Actual Doctor's Response:
patient history diagnosis of colitis and its causes always begins with the taking of the patient's history. the information the patient provides helps the physician guide the direction for diagnosis and treatment. in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea it is important to find out when the symptoms began how long they have lasted whether they come and go and what makes them better or worse. questions may be asked about travel because infections may arise while traveling particularly in undeveloped countries. patients often ask if the cause of symptoms is food poisoning but that is often a difficult question to answer immediately. if the patient has blood with bowel movements (which in general is not normal) further questions may be explored to screen for colon cancer or polyps. food poisoning not due to bacterial infections usually does not cause blood in the stool. evaluation of the body's other systems (cardiovascular neurological) may be necesseary. physical examination once the history is taken physical examination will be helpful in determining potential causes of the symptoms. signs of more severe disease with dehydration may include orthostatic changes in blood pressure and pulse rate (decreases in the former and increases in the latter upon standing). in patients who are low on fluid or blood blood pressure and pulse may be normal when they lie flat but may change with standing; the blood pressure falls and the pulse rate rises. temperature often is checked for fever. examination of the abdomen will disclose areas of tenderness and potentially abnormal masses if tumors or crohn's disease are present. the exam also may include a rectal examination to test the stool for blood and to feel for abnormal rectal masses. in patients where ischemic colitis is a consideration the health care practitioner may examine the heart and listen for sounds of abnormal restricted blood flow (bruits) in arteries located in the neck groin and abdomen as signs of coexisting vascular disease. in patients where there is clinical suspicion of viral infection no further testing may be needed. however in a patient who appears ill dehydrated or has significant pain fever or blood in the stool more evaluation may be required. other tests blood tests may be useful to explore the possibility of anemia or low red blood cell count due to bleeding. an elevated white blood cell count may be present as the body's response to infection. however an elevated white blood cell count does not necessarily mean infection since the white cell count may be elevated as part of the body's general response to any type of inflammation. blood chemistries may be measured looking for changes in electrolyte concentrations in the body especially abnormal sodium and potassium levels that would suggest serious diarrhea or loss of fluid. kidney function may be checked by measuring the bun (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels; this may be an important clue that patients are dehydrated. as well certain bacterial causes of diarrhea may also cause kidney failure. stool samples will likely be collected for culture searching for bacterial and parasitic infections as the cause of colitis. imaging colonoscopy is a test in which a gastroenterologist uses a thin flexible tube with a fiberoptic camera attached to it to look at the inside of the colon searching for the cause of the symptoms. the appearance of the colonic lining often allows the doctor to make the diagnosis and also provides the opportunity to look for tumors and polyps. biopsies -- small bits of tissue --can be removed from the mucosal lining during colonoscopy and then evaluated under the microscope to make or confirm a diagnosis of the presence or cause of colitis. computerized tomography and barium enemas are tests that are performed by a radiologist to explore the cause of colitis but often are ordered as part of the evaluation of abdominal pain or diarrhea.

if your doctor suspects that you have prostatitis or another prostate problem he or she may refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the urinary tract and the male reproductive system) to confirm the diagnosis. patients typically undergo a comprehensive exam including a digital rectal exam. the doctor will be able to evaluate whether the prostate gland is enlarged or tender. then if the doctor is still not sure what you have more tests may be done such as a prostate fluid analysis for signs of infection transrectal ultrasound biopsy or voiding studies. voiding studies involve the collection and analysis of urine to determine which part of the urinary system is infected.

the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps! i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did

i checked this out for you using a pharmacist's reference. xanax and valium both common medications for anxiety are contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to risk of birth defects. also i saw a note saying this is true for most mild anti-anxiety medications. your best bet is to learn some meditative techniques like deep breathing exercises. it's physically much more difficult for you to be fearful if you are breathing deeply and slowly. you can literally trick your body out of panic by doing it. best of all it's god for the baby too. avoid stimulants before flying such as caffeine because they can help you be more nervous.

some antacids may pass into breast milk. however no evidence exists that indicates that the ingestion of antacids through breast milk causes problems for nursing babies whose mothers use antacids occasionally. it is important that you check with your pharmacist about any possible interactions prior to taking an antacid. without knowing the name of a specific antacid it is difficult to say it is safe.

what are warts and what causes them?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a wart is a harmless skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (hpv). there are more than 100 known types of hpv. hpv infects the top layer of skin usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. the virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly forming a wart. most warts go away on their own within months or years. warts can grow anywhere on the body. they are most common among children and young adults. there are five kinds of warts. they look different and form on different parts of the body. common warts grow most often on the hands but they may be anywhere on the body. they are rough shaped like a dome and gray-brown in color. plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet. they look like hard thick patches of skin with dark specks. plantar warts may cause pain when you walk and you may feel like you are stepping on a pebble. flat warts usually grow on the face arms or legs. they are small (usually smaller than the eraser on the end of a pencil) have flat tops and can be pink light brown or light yellow. filiform warts usually grow around the mouth nose or beard area. they are the same color as your skin and have growths that look like threads sticking out of them. periungual warts grow under and around the toenails and fingernails. they look like rough bumps with an uneven surface and border. they can affect nail growth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

shingles is a skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. this virus is called the varicella zoster virus (vzv) and belongs to the herpes family of viruses. after an individual has chickenpox this virus lives dormant in the nervous system and is never fully cleared from the body. under certain circumstances such as emotional stress immune deficiency (from aids or chemotherapy) or with cancer the virus reactivates and causes shingles. in most cases of shingles however a cause for the reactivation of the virus is never found. anyone who has ever had chickenpox is at risk for the development of shingles although it occurs most commonly in people over the age of 60. it has been estimated that up to 1 000 000 cases of shingles occur each year in the u. s. the herpes virus that causes shingles and chickenpox is not the same as the herpes viruses that causes genital herpes (which can be sexually transmitted) or herpes mouth sores. shingles is medically termed herpes zoster.

what medications and treatments are available to treat bacterial vaginosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the antibiotics metronidazole (such as flagyl metrogel) clindamycin (such as cleocin clindesse ) and tinidazole ( tindamax ) are used to treat bacterial vaginosis. depending on the antibiotic you are prescribed you may take it by mouth or use it vaginally. during pregnancy women who are high-risk for preterm labor are advised to avoid vaginal application of any treatment. some doctors recommend that all pregnant women avoid vaginal treatments. studies generally show that vaginal antibiotics are as effective as oral antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis. 9 medicines inserted into the vagina cause fewer side effects than oral medicines although they can make you vulnerable to vaginal yeast infection. when considering treatment for bacterial vaginosis ask your doctor whether you should: use oral medicine or medicine inserted into the vagina. some women prefer to take pills rather than using a vaginal medicine. avoid having sex during the time that you are being treated. continue treatment during your menstrual period. medicine placed in your vagina is more difficult to use during your period but your doctor may recommend continuing treatment during this time. avoid drinking alcohol during treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. these medicines can cause severe nausea and vomiting if you drink alcohol when you are taking one of them. clindamycin does not. the mineral oil in clindamycin cream or ovules can cause latex condoms or diaphragms to fail. this is also true for metronidazole cream and tablets (the gel is fine for use with condoms and diaphragms). don't trust barrier methods of birth control when using this type of vaginal medicine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

could my 1-year-old's ear infection cause a high fever (103f)?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a fever is very non-specific -- there can be many things causing his fever but if he has an ear infection this is the most likely culprit. most ear infections are preceded by a cold so even colds can cause fevers of this magnitude but unfortunately i do not know enough about your child or his particular case to know if "something else" is going on. don't let a fever frighten you. children can get some pretty impressive fevers. medical providers rarely get excited with fevers under 105f in a one-year-old. children tend to get higher fevers because their immune system is not very good (the fever helps fight infection) and their "cooling system" is not very efficient (we cool by sweating over a large skin surface area so the smaller the body the less cooling). most fevers should improve on day three or four of the illness but if it does not or if you child is experiencing any other worrisome symptoms you will need to have him re-examined.

Actual Doctor's Response:
remember that most of the men on this planet are not circumsized but rather just the way that nature made them. the male foreskin is just a skin covering not unlike the lips or eyelids. it does not need to be removed and whatever is causing the irritation can likely be fixed. circumcision at age 12: not likely covered by insurance; this would be considered a cosmetic procedure done under anesthesia may be general or local will be painful for several weeks following surgery risk of infection and other post-surgical complications hi don't if he has some kind of irritation is this from him not washing behind his foreskin if its to tight get him to play with his foreskin he needs to start stretching it sideways and length ways and slowly he will be able to get his foreskin back then using a seas salt water wash this will help clean and get rid of any irritations behind it. it would be far better for his later sex life if he is left intact than having a circumcision. do hope this helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
what is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack or tia?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. up to 10% of people will experience a stroke within three months of a tia. since there is no way of predicting whether the next episode will resolve the patient needs to be educated that should symptoms occur they need to access medical care immediately. activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911 is recommended. if a stroke occurs there is a very short period of time where thrombolytic (clot dissolving) drugs [for example alteplase (tpa)] can be used to reverse a stroke. in most hospitals the drug can only be given within three hours of onset of stroke symptoms. in that three hours the patient needs to get to the hospital the diagnosis needs to be made laboratory tests and head ct scans need to be performed neurologic consultation needs to occur and the drug administered. the longer the delay the higher the risk that the drug won't work and that complications like bleeding into the brain will occur. specialized interventional radiologists can inject tpa directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. this can extend the time frame to six hours but currently this treatment is not widely available. tias should be considered the equivalent of angina of the brain. in heart disease angina is the heart pain that warns of potential heart attack. when heart muscle is damaged it cannot be replaced or repaired. similarly brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it too cannot be replaced.

Model's Recommendation:

transient ischemic attack therapy treatment for a transient ischemic attack is aimed at preventing a second stroke. since there is no way of determining the severity of future episodes and no guarantee that the symptoms will resolve prevention of a future tia or a stroke is crucial. treatment guidelines address a variety of targeted goals. antiplatelet therapy if the patient was not taking aspirin when the tia occurred it needs to be started (325 mg per day). if the patient was taking aspirin then another antiplatelet drug called dipyridamole needs to be added. aggrenox is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. if the patient cannot tolerate aspirin then clopidogrel (plavix) should be used. high blood pressure therapy even if the patient does not have hypertension or high blood pressure there may be benefit in taking antihypertensive medications. two classes of drugs are recommended to be started at the same time a diuretic and an ace inhibitor. the goal for normal blood pressure is 120/80. cholesterol lowering therapy guidelines recommend that a statin drug be started even if cholesterol levels are normal. risk modification smoking excessive alcohol obesity and lack of physical activity are considered risks for future stroke. the following recommendations are now suggested: smoking: counseling smoking cessation aids like nicotine gum or medications like varenicline (chantix) should be considered. environmental smoke should be avoided. alcohol: intake should be limited to two or fewer drinks a day for men and one or less for women. obesity: overweight people should try to lose weight using a combination of diet exercise and counseling. the goal is a bmi of 18. 5-24. 9 and a waistline of 35 inches or less for women and 40 inches or less for men. exercise: 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily is recommended for those who are able. for patients with disabilities a tailored exercise program to their capabilities should be arranged.

what can be absorbed by the stomach? . what percentages of various normally consumed foods and liquids can be absorbed into the body through the stomach. while i understand that the intestines absorb most of the nutrients we consume i was lead to believe that a potion of some foods and beverages were absorbed into the body through the stomach.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the stomach does not absorb nutrients but it does play a role enhancing absorption of certain nutrients in the small intestine. for example the stomach secretes intrinsic factor which binds to b12 for absorption in the small intestine. stomach acid turns iron into a form that is better absorbed in the small intestine. and people who have part of their stomach removed may be at risk for osteoporosis because the stomach empties faster which can decrease the amount of calcium being absorbed and utilized by the body. anyone who has surgery to remove part of the stomach should see a dietitian to be sure they are not at risk for nutrition deficiencies.

most helpful answer i do not see how drinking something acidic (lemon juice is citric acid) will make your body alkaline. doesn't make sense. i have never heard that having an alkaline body (alkalosis) would prevent a cancer reoccurrence. sounds like a bunch of baloney to me. i am not sure where you read this or the credentials of who is recommending it but i think this notion lacks scientific validity. our body works very hard to maintain a properly ph balance. drink lemon juice in water (lemonade! ) if you want or if you like it. the vitamin c will be nice but don't expect it to make your body alkaline. dr moser is incorrect. lemon and lime juices are absolutely alkalizing to the body. this is not to say they are alkaline in nature because the are obviously acidic. but the way the body metabolizes the juice produces an alkalizing effect. here is a video that might help explain it better: youtube. com/watch? v=wndfdia6a0s&feature=player_embedded#! there are many licensed dietitians and nutritionist who have written of this fact. do yourself a favor and research it at length. most doctors are not aware of the chemistry involved (note: the average md has fewer than 8 hours of preventative medicine education - many have none whatsoever). an answer i found elsewhere: lemon lime apple cider vinegar and tomato are highly acidic. strong acids bring the ph of a solution waaay down even in small amounts. also your blood has a "buffer" system to neutralize acids keeping your blood ph relatively stable regardless of what you eat. it seems to me that this alkaline cooking fad has no scientific basis or at least led by? misguided science. i really dislike throwing around scientific words when you don't know what you are talking about. according to a studies evaluated in the journal of environmental and public health on the alkaline diet it is possible to alkalize your body through diet. see the article here --<link> one of the studies looked at alkaline supplementation using potassium bicarbonate which was effective. similarly i have personally used baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to alleviate the symptoms of lactic acid buildup from high intensity training (leg day). it works rather rapidly to neutralize blood acidity and removes the feelings of nausea. none of the studies references examined lemon juice. the alkaline diet is primarily an overhyped vegan diet. meat is not evil nor bad for you. however eating multiple daily servings of leafy green onions and cruciferous vegetables is enough to raise and maintain a higher blood ph in a healthy way. in addition they are an excellent source of fiber vitamins and minerals. by the way the temporary lower blood ph caused by resistance exercise is good for you as it causes the secretion of growth hormone and causes fat loss.

Actual Doctor's Response:
well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps! i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an "expert" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail.

i know of no std that appears as a "bump" a few hours after having sex so this may be just some vaginal trauma. since you did have sex two weeks ago probably without a condom there is still the possibility that you were exposed to an std. getting tested would be advised. using a condom next time would be less expensive less-stressful for you and infinitely safer.

what can a mom do to get their child with mrsa in ear better. his ent is not doing much. its been ongoing for 4 months. . my 20 month old son with ear tubes is battling mrsa in his ear for 4 months. we have done massive amount of antibiotics his ent doctor says that he thinks the last chance we have is to remove his ear tube and replace it as well as remove his adenoids. im really worried that with the mrsa still present inside the ear if it is ok to have him go into surgery. how could he gotten mrsa in the first place. there has been puss coming out of my sons right ear for 4 months. his ent doesn't seem to care.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the ent does care but mrsa (assuming he has a community-acquired type and not the more-severe hospital type) is very challenging to treat. you can ask for an infectious disease consultation but your ent may be doing the best that can be done. you can also ask to see another ent for a second opinion. sometimes we have no idea where the infection came from but we do know it came from people. some people are carriers and do not know it. some kids get it in day-care now. i can understand your frustrations so the only thing you can do is try to get his evaluation and treatment to a higher level but getting a second opinion or adding an infectious disease specialist to the treatment team.

pain in this area especially in a person who has been coughing for a week could indicate a few different things but unfortunately the exact cause could not be determined based solely on symptoms. he would need to be examined and perhaps have another chest x-ray (findings can change). basilar pneumonia (pneumonia the lower parts of the lungs can cause chest pain). someone who is coughing can have muscle strain of the intercostal (between the rib) muscles. finally people who cough often swallow a great deal of air. when this air is trapped in the large intestines it can migrate upward under the ribs and cause pain due to pressure against the diaphragm. there can be other causes of course. you are right to be concerned so please see his medical provider again.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9717
yes. chest pain has many possible causes; some are harmless but some (like a heart attack) can be life-threatening. part of the problem is that the heart and other internal organs have a type of sensory nerve conduction where it is sometimes difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact origin of a painful sensation. pain due to something wrong in the heart lungs or belly can be vague or feel like something else. this is why chest pain can be such a difficult problem for those who have it as well as for their doctors. gas causes swelling in the intestines and a bloated feeling. when gas causes pain it’s usually in the abdomen (belly). however the pain may also be felt in the chest. if pain is due to gas it should go away within a short time. other causes of chest pain not due to the heart include problems with the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) musculoskeletal (chest wall) pain problems in the lungs and many others. studies have shown that even doctors have a hard time identifying the cause of chest pain just through conversation or physical examination. laboratory tests a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram are generally needed to know for sure that chest pain is nothing serious. no one wants to call 911 or sit in an emergency room to be treated for what turns out to be gas pain. however playing a waiting game when you are having chest pain can be a gamble with your health or maybe your life. if you’re having chest pain in almost all cases a doctor’s recommendation will be to seek medical attention. yes thanks i have been having a chest pain and thru my underarm since early this morning i am scared it could be a heart attack then again i have experienced this pain before but does not last as long as it has today. it gets worse when i lay down. could it be gas or should i go to the emergency room yes yes

can you help with condylox genital warts treatment and side effects? . hi i have used the treatment for the 3days twice a day and now it is sore swollen the skin in white with little open skin marks where warts used to be. also it is a little smelly. is this normal? . the warts appear to have gone but i can't even wipe myself properly once been to the toilet although it doesnt hurt when i do go. i hope you can help.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation. assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods. the chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue. this can appear burned white or even black. this is expected. soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated.

pressure from the growing uterus on the blood vessels carrying blood from the lower body causes fluid retention that results in swelling (edema) in the legs and feet. recommendations: try not to stay on your feet for long periods of time. avoid standing in one place. drink plenty of fluids (at least six to eight glasses of fluids a day). avoid foods high in salt (sodium). elevate your legs and feet while sitting. avoid crossing your legs. wear loose comfortable clothing; tight clothing can slow circulation and increase fluid retention. don't wear tight shoes; choose supportive shoes with low wide heels. keep your diet rich in protein; too little protein can cause fluid retention. notify your health care provider if your hands or face swell. this may be a warning sign of preeclampsia. rest on your side during the day to help increase blood flow to your kidneys.

Patient Question:
will penicelin cure an uti?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a urinary tract infection (uti ) is a bacterial infection so an antibiotic is an effective treatment. penicillin specifically may be used to treat a uti but the choice of medication sometimes is based on the specific bacteria causing the infection. it's important not to try to self-diagnose a uti. only a urine sample can confirm the presence of bacteria. many of the symptoms of uti such as pain or burning with urination (peeing) can be caused by other things. that's why it's important to see a health care provider for an examination if you think you may have a urinary tract infection. it's also important never to self-treat conditions like this. never use "leftover" antibiotics (you should never have any leftover antibiotics; it's extremely important to take every pill in the bottle whenever an antibiotic is prescribed) to treat a cold flu or any other problem such as when you think you might have a uti. misuse of antibiotics in this way can lead to the development of "superbugs" that are resistant to treatment. if you think you have a uti i urge you to see a health care provider for a simple urine test. that way you'll be on the right path toward treatment. best to you!

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9883
it depends on the bacteria that is causing the urinary tract infection. penicillin is not the preferred drug that is used for utis since it usually is not sensitive to the common bacteria usually bacteria that normally live in the colon (enteric bacteria). i have never treated a uti with penicillin. penicillin works great for strep so if the uti is caused by strep it could help but most of the time utis are other types of organisms that are resistant to plain 'ol penicillin. i am assuming you have not had a urinalysis or a urine culture. if you are self-diagnosing and self-treating a uti with an old prescription of penicillin i would strongly caution you against doing this. utis can quickly get out of hand if treated improperly and could end up involving the kidneys. diagnosing and treating a uti is best left up to a medical professional.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if you’re drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones -- the most common type -- eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones.

Actual Doctor's Response:
only your girlfriend could possibly answer this question but clearly she is having some issues associated with your sexual intimacy. there can be many reasons and some may be deeply private. for instance if she had a past experience that was troubling to her like a prior molestation she may have difficulty. she could have some underlying fears of getting pregnant getting an std or she may be just frightened about sex. if possible she may benefit from discussing this with a counselor or you can try talking with her. i would suggest that you be very gentle and understanding and not push her to be more sexually involved than she is comfortable doing. back off for a while and allow her more time. go slow.

it's impossible to say what's going on without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider or your gynecologist. breast cancer can cause nipple soreness so it's not something you want to ignore (even if you're a man). another common cause of nipple soreness is called "runner's nipple. " this occurs when the nipple becomes irritated due to clothing rubbing across it repeatedly. this chafing can cause the nipple to become red inflamed and very tender. you don't have to be a runner to have this happen; any constrictive clothing can cause it from tight bras to t-shirts. you can treat runner's nipple by gently cleansing the nipple applying lotion and then putting an adhesive bandage over it to protect it from chafing. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
it’s sunday and my 3 year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an “ear infection” is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the “middle ear. ” the medical term for this is “otitis media ” sometimes called “acute otitis media” to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasn’t been congested it probably isn’t an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you don’t necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isn’t thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isn’t super-miserable it’s ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what they’re feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.

Actual Doctor's Response:
something has changed. since you were both virgins when you started it could be assumed that you were both free of disease and safe for each other. this changes as soon as one partner is unfaithful to the other and creates the potential for diseases to come into the relationship. maybe you should both see a doctor about this.

the spleen is on the same side as your left kidney so one possible explanation for hematuria (blood in the urine) would be a contusion of the kidney with bleeding. free blood in the abdominal cavity from a ruptured spleen would not anatomically be able to get into your "closed" urinary system so i suspect that your injury was not completely limited to your spleen.

most helpful answer yes you definitely could have gotten pregnant. you should be alert for a missed period because if you are pregnant you should remove the nuvaring as soon as possible after you know positively you're carrying a baby. like any other type of hormonal birth control method (such as birth control pills) the nuvaring typically takes a month to be considered fully effective. since you didn't wait for the required amount of time before having unprotected sex it's possible for you to have become pregnant. that said it's less typical to become pregnant while you're on your period. a woman is most fertile (likely to become pregnant) a couple of days before her body releases an egg (ovulates). while that time frame is different for every woman it generally occurs around days 13-15 for a woman with a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. the answer to your question then is: it's possible but not likely you got pregnant when you had unprotected sex the same day you inserted the nuvaring. if you ever have questions about your birth control method you can always ask your pharmacist or your gynecologist. wishing you well!

i am 17 and sexually active and i've been having some vaginal discomfort recently. recently my vagina have been itching like crazy and a little puffy almost like its swollen and accompanied by burning while urinating and a yellowish discharge with a slight odour. i am not getting any abdominal pain. can this be a yeast infection? . what are some remedies? . are there over the counter drugs?

Actual Doctor's Response:
go to a gynaecologist immediately if you know the person you have been sexually active with speak to them about their medical problems and maybe bring them to the gynaecologist because they could have something they may not know about. you are experience inflammation discolouration which can be caused by cysts forming on the vaginal wall either from a cut friction burn (are you lubing or just dry balling it) which can get infected. odour is normal in private areas it is just bacteria forming in a humid moist area proper cleaning can fix that but if it smells sickening then it could be harmful bacteria. you could have a urinal tract condition which effects the urinary tract system which could be seen with blood in your pee. make sure you clean it thoroughly before visiting a gynaecologist avoid anymore intercourse with people as you may spread it is possible your partner or partners may be carriers meaning they do not show symptoms similar to yours.

hi masturbating with a sex toy would not be classed as having sexual intercourse it would be best if you go get checked out though or try using some coconut oil(extra virgin) is best and good at helping to clear up what could be a yeast infection that does not want to leave you. but also try these for help. <link> <link> <link> <link> <link> also google sea salt and the vagina. vaginal itching natural cures includes sea salt fungi live in air in soil on plants and in water. some live in the human body. only about half of all types of fungi are harmful. some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. you can inhale the spores or they can land on you. as a result fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. you are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics. fungi can be difficult to kill. for skin and nail infections you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections. so you can get a yeast infection from many sources and also remember we do carry many yeasts around on our body's as we need them. do hope this helps you. good luck

what causes warts?

Actual Doctor's Response:
warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv) which enters the skin and causes cells to multiply rapidly. usually warts spread through direct contact. each person responds differently and not everyone exposed to hpv will develop a wart.

Patient Question:
my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?

Actual Doctor's Response:
seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.

tramadol (ultram) is an fda pregnancy category c drug which means that animal reproduction studies have shown risks to a developing fetus but there no adequate studies done in humans to determine risk to a developing baby. in animal studies tramadol was toxic to the fetuses of pregnant mice rats and rabbits when given at very high doses to the mothers. the doses given were 2 to 15 times the human dose (on a pound-for-pound basis). at these doses tramadol was toxic to the mothers and the fetuses had low birth weights bone problems and developmental delays after being born. for these reasons doctors recommend tramadol not be given during pregnancy unless the risks to the mother (from uncontrolled pain) clearly outweigh the risks to the developing baby.

Patient Question:
i rode a train 12 hrs ago & now feel dizzy & feel like i am still on it. is this motion sickness? and will it go away?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you may have a condition called mdd (mal de debarquement) a type of vertigo that occurs after an individual gets off a boat usually a cruise lasting several days but it could happen from this 12-hour train trip. people describe the imbalance symptoms as a rocking boat worse when you stand still or lie down. these annoying symptoms can last months or can fade relatively fast. it is more common in women between the ages of 40-50. unfortunately most medications that work for other forms of dizziness (meclizine scopolamine) do not work very well for mdd. valium (diazepam) and the antidepressant drug amitriptyline has been used with limited success. these drugs help block or suppress those aberrant inner ear signals that are causing those symptoms and help with the associated anxiety. vestibular rehabilitation therapy has also been shown to be effective if your symptoms are lasting a long time. since there are many many other medical causes for imbalance and vertigo your first step is to be properly evaluated by an ent specialist.

i am 37 and trying to get pregnant for a year and a half. will clomid be effective if i have been ovulating normally? . we have a 4 year old daughter and had no problems conceiving her. both my husband and i were tested and our results were within normal limits.

Actual Doctor's Response:
in many cases unexplained infertility is associated with an age-related decline in fertility. unlike sperm that are being made continuously eggs are all made before a woman is born. as a woman ages her eggs age which results in embryos that make mistakes in cell division more often. this causes more unrecognized miscarriages (infertility) recognized miscarriages and down's syndrome as women age. the average age that women show up complaining of unexplained infertility is around 34-36 years old. for this reason a common theme in counteracting the age-related decline in fertility is increasing the number of eggs that a woman recruits each month. clomid is a drug that corrects some ovulation problems and it also occasionally increases the number of eggs that a woman recruits. it is a fairly safe and inexpensive first step. however many women will eventually need to use gonadotropins (fsh) to increase the number of eggs. this is call controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and can be followed by intercourse insemination or oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer. the differences between these therapies is the probability of success each month the risk of multiple gestation or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the cost of the therapy. your doctor can help you navigate these options.

Patient Question:
how does smoking affect my skin?

Actual Doctor's Response:
smoking is a very unhealthy habit to start in your lifetime. not only can using tobacco products cause cancer and heart disease but it can also affect the complexion of your skin and cause you to age prematurely. the byproducts found in tobacco products deprive the skin of oxygen and vital nutrients. this deprivation can lead to a pale and uneven skin tone. if you begin smoking at a young age changes in your skin can begin to be seen early on. there are more than 4 000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke; many of these harmful chemicals encourage the destruction of collagen and the elasticity of the skin. even being around secondhand smoke can cause deeper wrinkles and sagging of the skin. now let's discuss how smoking physically affects the appearance of your face and body. smoking loosens the skin around the eyes causing deep wrinkles and crow's feet. deep lines and wrinkles can also develop around the mouth from dragging on your cigarette; this look is also known as the "smoker's pucker. " your breasts can also begin to droop and fall prematurely. the skin on the back of your upper arms can also start to sag. you are also more prone to develop age spots (liver spots) on the face and body. your fingers and fingernails can begin to turn yellow or brown after years of smoking; however these stains will begin to fade after you quit smoking. smoking also increases your chances to develop alopecia (hair loss). now that you know how the use of tobacco products affects can your appearance let's look at some of the benefits of quitting smoking. once you quit smoking your circulation improves; this leads to an increased amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the skin. some of the damage from smoking can be reversed by using retinoids antioxidants (such as a and c vitamins) and chemical peels. make an appointment with your dermatologist to see what skin-care regimen is best for you. here are some overall health benefits that come with the cessation of smoking. after 20 minutes your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. after 24 hours your risk of a heart attack begins to drop. after a few weeks the cilia will begin to sweep impurities from the lungs again. after a year you decrease your risk of a heart attack by half. if you want to quit smoking and you are having trouble consult your physician.

cigarette smoke contains more than 4 000 chemicals that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream and are taken right into the skin. smoking causes the blood vessels in the top layers of skin to get smaller so your skin gets less oxygen. smoking also makes skin thinner slows its ability to heal and increases wrinkles. you may get lines on your upper lip often called smoker's lines. your skin can also take on a grayish color.

Actual Doctor's Response:
high blood pressure makes your heart work harder and over time can damage blood vessels throughout your body. if the blood vessels in your kidneys are damaged they may stop removing wastes and extra fluid from your body. the extra fluid in your blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more. it's a dangerous cycle. high blood pressure is one of the leading causes of kidney failure also commonly called end-stage renal disease (esrd). people with kidney failure must either receive a kidney transplant or go on dialysis. every year high blood pressure causes more than 25 000 new cases of kidney failure in the u. s.

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patient’s condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local children’s hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry you're dealing with an abnormal pap smear result. before i get to your questions about hpv let's back up for just a moment. an abnormal pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have human papillomavirus (hpv). the pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. an abnormal pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. in fact most abnormal pap test results are not cancer at all. certainly hpv can cause cervical cancer. however you need to receive a special test (not unlike a pap test actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for hpv. in answer to your question hpv is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. the centers for disease control estimate as many as 50% of sexually active men and women get hpv at some point in their lives. often people who are infected with it have no symptoms. so while it's not exactly true to say hpv can lie dormant in your system it is accurate to say you can be infected with hpv and live with it for many years without knowing it. your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal pap test result with you. when that happens you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about hpv. i hope you find this response helpful!

Patient Question:
how is drug-induced hair loss treated?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's important to review any medications you take and discuss their potential side effects with your doctor and pharmacist. when hair loss does occur from a drug you're taking there is a good chance that the hair will grow back on its own after you stop taking the medication. if stopping the drug does not improve hair thinning you may need to be treated with finasteride (propecia) or minoxidil (rogaine) medications that slow hair loss and can stimulate new hair growth. one technique may help prevent hair loss during chemotherapy. it's called scalp hypothermia and it involves placing ice packs on the scalp a few minutes before -- and for about a half-hour after -- chemotherapy treatment. cooling the scalp reduces blood flow to the hair follicles making it harder for the chemotherapy drugs to get into the follicular cells. cooling also reduces biochemical activity making the hair follicles less susceptible to damage from chemotherapy drugs. one concern with this technique is the risk of cancer recurrence in the scalp. after chemotherapy treatment the hair usually grows back in very quickly but it may change in texture. in rare cases the hair will stay thin even after treatment has been stopped. minoxidil can help regrow hair that is slow to return. some chemotherapy patients wear a wig or hat to hide their hair loss until their hair grows back.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9885
if you are experiencing hair loss your doctor will ask you several questions including: when did the hair loss start? how quickly has the hair been falling out? what other symptoms do you have such as scalp itching burning or tingling? what drugs were you taking in the four months leading up to the hair loss? what other illnesses do you have? have you made any changes to your diet or hair-care routine? the doctor also will examine your scalp to look at the pattern of hair loss. tests that may be done include: thyroid function tests to look for thyroid disorders which can sometimes cause hair loss. hair shaft exam to look at the shape length and fragility of the hairs. pull test: gently pulling on about 60 hairs to see how many come out. biopsy: removing a piece of scalp tissue for examination. hormone tests. it can be difficult to prove which drug is causing the hair loss or even that a drug is to blame. your doctor may ask you to stop taking one drug at a time and see whether your hair stops falling out but it can take two to three months after stopping a drug for the hair loss to end.

contagious period for cold. i have been sick with a cold off and on for about 2 months. the last time i got sick was about week ago. i am going to visit my sister and her newborn. is it safe to do so?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a cold only lasts a week so i am concerned that you have been sick for two months. you are either getting back to back colds or there is another reason for your symptoms. since i have no way of knowing exactly what you have or when you contracted your "cold" i really cannot tell you if you are contagious or not. well avoid meeting a newborn if you are down with cold and cough as it is highly contagious. we advise to take curcuma with tinospora powder daily to increase your immunity. steam inhalation will help you get rid of viral infection. in warmth cold virus cannot survive.

Patient Question:
can allergy shots affect sexual function? . i've recently started experiencing difficulty reaching an orgasm. i am on hrt and 57 years old. i am trying to narrow down what might be the cause and the only change i have made has been in starting allergy shots at the first of the year. . . . this may be a reach in my thinking. i have been unable to reach my ob/gyn doctor to ask her questions and the information online with regard to sexually active older women is almost non-existent. men apparently rate #1.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have never heard that allergy shots would have any adverse sexual side-effects. as a matter of fact i do not think it would be medically possible for this to ever happen. see your ob-gyn for a consultation. if there is a discoverable cause for your inorgasmia it will not be your allergy shots.

i don't believe that a personal choice to be celibate has any medical consequences. while humans are inherently sexual beings celibacy does not cause disease. it does require an strong conviction however. i've done a fair amount of non religious research on this and the answer is that the body will eventually get used to complete celibacy. after a while you might have a wet dream. even if you don't your sperm will eventually reabsorb into your body. you might get prostatits if you are used to having release and suddenly go down to nothing and epididymitis is also possible though less common. you also might find prostate fluid oozing out of you when you defaecate after a while. you do want to be clear in your reasons for doing this however. any time you do something that isn't natural like not ejaculating at all even if it isn't harmful you want to know why. if it's to please a partner for instance then make sure it pleases you too. otherwise resentment and other problems will build up. if it's because of guilt or shame issues have those taken care of you'll be happier and healthier. i'm not judging or presuming anything i just wanted to mention this as a friendly reminder.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i don't know the accuracy or even the type of tests that you had. this may be question for the lab or the medical provider who ordered them. there are many people have had sex with a herpes infected partner who have not contracted the disease. i suspect your 20 second encounter was a "missed bullet" and that you did not get herpes but that is just a guess based on what you have shared.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi when you say your cycle this means your menstrual cycle ovulation is just a 1 day thing and it happens mostly around day 14 give or take a day male sperm needs to be in place around 3 to 4 days before that day? its take male sperm 3 days to get in place to receive your egg either side so sperm splits up and goes to both ovary's and can live for up to 7 days if it gets there after day14 your probable safe. did you get spotting around day 21? but some times you may not notice this happen. good luck

hi so the 20th your just 5 days into your cycle then and just finished with bleeding then? around day 14 is ovulation day its like give or take a day and male sperm lives in side you at most 5 to 7 days so there is this an outside chance of not being pregnant. but rereading the above you was having unprotected sex during your period then? correct then the chances are high your not pregnant and this what you call cervical fluid was probably your mucus plug forming or from that. but its still a waiting game but please don't stress keep happy and when you do get the chance just think bc and do something about it the pill is probably the best choice around. hope this helps you. good luck

Actual Doctor's Response:
as much as i would like to address your question there can be dozens of reasons why your period was shorter this time. it would really be impossible to offer you a specific reason without knowing your complete medical history and of course being able to examine you and run a few diagnostic tests. i suggest that you make an appointment with your women's health care specialist for a consultation so that you can be properly assessed.

choose endurance activities such as jogging aerobics bicycling rowing or swimming. exercise at a moderately intense level. you should be able to talk without running out of breath during the activity. exercise for more than 40 minutes. during the first 20 minutes your body taps into your sugar reserves (carbohydrates stored as blood glucose and muscle glycogen). between 20 to 40 minutes of exercise the body continues to use up your sugar reserves and starts to tap into your body fat. after 40 minutes the body starts to burn even more fat. choose aquatic workouts or exercise in the cold. this causes the body to burn more energy and melt fat more quickly. the body draws on its fat reserves to stay warm.

Actual Doctor's Response:
trichomoniasis is sexually-transmitted so one or both of you had it. perhaps as long as a year or more. your risky sexual practices did not cause trich. it was contracted by contact with someone who had it not likely from sex toys or vaginal-anal sex (this can transmit colon bacteria to the vagina and cause a urinary tract infection or vaginitis). hi! partner in the last year but how many before? the trouble with tric is you can get and then it hide deep in tissue so it could be from a previous partner? you will only know many you have had that's not a put down nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite. but in future just go from vaginal to anal never back or the other way round. hope this helps you. good luck

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very unpleasant. a viral infection such as the common cold can last as long as 14 days though most people only experience symptoms for up to a week. so it's possible this is a virus. on the other hand it could be a sinus infection. i've heard patients describe a "crushing" sensation with sinus infections. no matter what's causing your symptoms i think after a week of suffering through them you deserve a diagnosis. i'd suggest visiting your primary care provider to see what's going on. if it's something that can be treated with antibiotics then you'll get a prescription and should feel better within days after starting on the meds. if you do receive a prescription for antibiotics be sure to take the entire course of pills. do not stop taking them just because you begin feeling better. this is very important. you've done the right thing by trying to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter products but obviously that hasn't helped. i hope you'll now seek medical attention. you've earned it. all the best to you!

Actual Doctor's Response:
halcion is a medication that has been used in the past to treat insomnia and you can become dependent on it. it has a special code on it which means that there are special laws that the pharmacist has to follow and the doctor has to follow when they write for something like this. as far as dependency how do we judge what dependency really means? dependency would mean that if you stop taking the medication you would experience withdrawal effects which means that you would be -- maybe have the shakes. this particular medication doctors need to monitor closely to make sure that you are not on it all the time. a lot of people are on it for maybe 7-14 days. so it shouldn't be something that should be prescribed every single day every single night for a longer period of time. there are newer medications like lunesta like ambien that have better medication profiles as far as side effects. we would rather see you on something like that instead because of the fact that they have decrease side effects. won't make you as tired won't cause falls in the home; especially for the elderly patient halcion we really don't want to use that drug because it has been shown that they can fall out of bed sometimes on it. so once again we have got to be really carefully about the choices that we make and once again talk to your pharmacist about concerns questions side effects and possibly we would refer you back to your physician or healthcare provider. for instance if you find a medication that works for you and you don't have as many side effects that's the key. that's what we want to do. we want to make sure that you are having the best quality of life.

falafel a middle eastern dish is high in protein and popular with vegetarians. it’s usually made from chick peas shaped into a ball and served in a pita pocket or on folded flat bread. my family members are fans too and we love getting falafel pita sandwiches at the farmer’s market in town. we are such falafel fans that i want to be able to make them at home too. they are actually easy to make ahead of time and can be used as a fun lunch entree for grown-ups and kids alike. falafel are usually deep fried but you can lighten them up by either cooking them in a nonstick frying pan with a controlled amount of canola or olive oil. or you can lightly coat the outside of the falafel balls with canola or olive oil cooking spray and bake them until nicely browned. here’s a recipe for the baked version. ingredients 1/3 cup dry bulgur wheat 15 ounce can garbanzo beans (chickpeas) drained and rinsed (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup chopped green onions 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1 large egg higher omega-3 if available 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons minced or chopped garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional) 1/2 cup finely ground italian-style or plain breadcrumbs canola or olive oil cooking spray preparation 1. place bulgur in a small bowl and pour in boiling water to cover it by 2 inches. let soak for about 15 minutes. 2. in the bowl of a food processor combine 3/4 cup of the cooked bulgur (remove the bulgur from the bowl with a slotted spoon) with garbanzo beans green onions whole wheat flour egg parsley garlic cumin and red pepper flakes if desired. pulse scraping the sides of the bowl after about 5 seconds until the mixture is thick enough to form into balls. 3. place breadcrumbs in a small bowl. use a tablespoon measure to scoop a level tablespoon of falafel dough and drop it into the breadcrumbs; roll it around in the breadcrumbs to lightly coat. place the coated falafel on a sheet of waxed paper on the counter. repeat with the remaining falafel dough. cover the falafels loosely and let them stand for 1 hour. (you can skip this waiting period if you don’t have the time). 4. preheat oven to 450-degrees. while still on the waxed paper coat the tops of the falafels generously with cooking spray. lay the falafels cooking-spray-side down on a cookie sheet. spray the tops of the falafels generously with more cooking spray. 5. bake until golden brown about 22 minutes. while they are baking you can whip up a batch of tahini dressing. yield: makes about 5 servings. nutritional analysis per serving: 182 calories 9 g protein 31 g carbohydrate 3 g fat . 4 g saturated fat . 4 g monounsaturated fat . 4 g polyunsaturated fat 42 mg cholesterol 6 g fiber 464 mg sodium. calories from fat: 14 percent. omega-3 fatty acids =. 1 gram omega-6 fatty acids =. 3 gram. tahini dressing ingredients 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste or butter) room temperature and stirred to smooth 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon minced or chopped garlic 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon tabasco sauce (optional) 2 teaspoons honey preparation 1. place all the dressing ingredients in a blender or small food processor bowl or small mixing bowl. 2. beat or pulse until well blended (it should look whipped). 3. place dressing in a bowl and serve or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. yield: makes 1/2 cup. nutritional analysis per tablespoon: 50 calories 2 g protein 3 g carbohydrate 3. 5 g fat . 5 g saturated fat 1. 5 g monounsaturated fat 1. 5 g polyunsaturated fat 0 mg cholesterol . 4 g fiber 38 mg sodium. calories from fat: 63 percent. omega-3 fatty acids = 0 gram omega-6 fatty acids = 1. 5 grams.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sooboob. i've got the same symptoms & spent a week in one hospital & a week later a week at another hospital while dr. s were trying to figure out what was causing the extreme nausea that was sooo forceful it made me dry heave but never a true vomiting. the only thing they found after extensive examining with every kind of mri ultrasound ct scan & lab u can think of. was a golfball size tumor in the center of my liver. i've read several threads of people with tumors in their liver that claim to have the same symptoms & their dr. would never attribute the symptoms to the tumor. i had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago & started having the nausea april of last yr & the pain started as an occasional pain. similar to the gallbladder pain but grew in intensity & frequency over a several month period. i'm a woman & notice that the pain is at it's peek a week before my cycle starts (pms) & during my cycle then it subsides to tolerable & the nausea increases to intolerable. they take turns ruining my day lol. hope this isn't what's wrong with u but your symptoms are the same as mine & all the dr's i've seen are too eager to hand me the ibs med & nexium. however the meds make the pain worse.

i'd recommend seeing your physician since pain of this type can be indicative of many different organ issues including but not limited to stomach liver and (your non-existent) gallbladder. as a fellow ibs sufferer i sympathize--if this feels different than ibs pain it probably is. if the urination is frequent or painful (or both) and the back pain persists this could be a uti that's got a foothold in your right kidney and could be developing into a nephritis which is nothing to play around about. drink plenty of water and book yourself in to see a doctor.

Patient Question:
will eating turkey help me sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
well there’s a big myth about turkey okay so turkey does have l-tryptophan in it. you’d have to eat about a 46 pound turkey to get enough tryptophan in your system to for it to make a difference and the truth of the matter is that tryptophan doesn’t work particularly well in the presence of protein. so it doesn’t really work. there’s just as much tryptophan in beef and pork so if you eat a big thanksgiving meal it’s not what’s making you sleepy is not the turkey. it’s probably the preparations and the lack of sleep you got the night before getting the meal ready that’s actually making you tired.

well first of all everybody knows what somebody looks like who hasn’t had a good night’s sleep so just aesthetically we see that there’s a big difference in somebody who has had a good night’s sleep and somebody who hasn’t but what does that really mean? one of the things we know is that with sleep deprivation circulation is down. you don’t circulate nearly as well as you would have if you were well rested. and so one of the things we see with poor circulation we see edema underneath the eye. the same thing holds through for dark circles. the skin underneath your eye turns out to be almost paper thin. it’s incredibly small and so the capillaries that are under here when the blood is not circulating well and giving that nice rosy appearance can pull which again can cause these dark circles. now you may get a ton of sleep and still have dark circles because that could be genetically predisposed. next we look at overall skin health. okay and so when we look at your skin what we now say is a healthy skin it’s sort of a glow rosy cheeks red cheeks things of that nature not necessarily the red nose per se but just the appearance. again that’s a circulation issue and we know that circulation is decreased significantly with sleep deprivation.

want to know side effects of facedown mastrubation. i have been doing face down masturbation since i am 14 now i am 28 recently i came to know about facedown mastrubation it can cause dangerous side affects and it is not usual pattern of mastrubation request if some one can give me the details on this till now i haven't tried for an intercourse as i am not married yet. will there be any problem in intercourse because of this way of mastrubation? will it lead to impotency?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are no "side effects" (like impotency) from masturbation. face down face up face sideways or hanging upside down. i began masturbating as a small child. i didn't know anybody else did it but decided it was wrong and kept trying to stop! anyhow i did it lying on my stomach and it was many years before i read that doing it that way could be bad for one but i don't remember why unless it was too much pressure on the penis. eventually i learned that masturbation in general was not only not immoral depending on the circumstances but it took me a long time to learn to do it lying on my back but it was something i rarely did until after my wife died. hi the problem by ding this is when it comes to real sex you may not have the sensitivity that you should have this stems from dry masturbating and dry masturbating is not good for you you could end up with scars on your gland so take a break for a couple of weeks the start masturbating with some kind of oil baby oil will do the using you hand start masturbating slowly with a featherlight touch not a hard grip masturbating should have the same touch as the inside if a vagina this way when it comes to real sex your brain will know just how it should feel. good luck usually when masturbating the only side effect is stomach cramp

Patient Question:
what level of spf should one use on a daily basis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should use a minimum spf a 15 but even more importantly than that you can even go higher to a 30 or up to a 50. i think beyond that it doesn't make much difference. but the most important thing is to reapply it every few hours because whether or not you are out there swimming sweating or rubbing it off it wears off over time and it gets degraded by the sun exposure itself. so you have to apply enough product but also reapply it often enough in order to maintain that protection. don't forget to put it on your neck and your chest because those are areas that are exposed. if you are wearing a scoop neck or a v-neck and you are just walking around it's incidental sun exposure. the sun exposure is cumulative. your skin remembers that first exposure as a child and that's been building up building up building up in your skin and eventually it crosses a threshold when you hit your; it could be in your 20s 30s 40s or beyond depending on your skin type and how much exposure you have had where all of a sudden it starts to show. both as signs of aging and even worse signs of skin cancer.

diphenhydramine is a commonly used otc product. it is an antihistamine medication with one side-effect profile of drowsiness. it is found as the active ingredient by itself or in combination products with pain relief medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. if you are pregnant and have trouble sleeping i would first consult your ob-gyn before taking any medications. diphenhydramine has a pregnancy risk category listed as b which means studies have not been able to prove an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. if you were to select an otc product for aid with sleep stay away from the combination products that contain pain aids specifically ibuprofen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (nsaids) medications. more importantly continue to keep your health-care professionals in the loop about your otc selections. while otc medications are easily available for self-treatment it doesn’t always mean it is safe and effective for your individual purpose. read the bottles carefully and ask questions with your pharmacist.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry you're going through this. pain issues can negatively impact a person's quality of life and in your case you've had to reduce your running because of it. if it's been a year since you last saw the doctor about this it's time to go back. for one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel. for another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it re-checked. many conditions can cause the pains you've described. anything from sciatica to worn cartilage in the joints to arthritis could be the culprit. if you don't feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion. i wish you all the best!

how to get rid of the poison ivy rashes? . although i thought i was being careful when cutting down some poison ivy in by backyard i now have it. itching is under control but can anyone help on getting rid of the rashes or do i just wait it out? got it 5 days ago. it is also spreading to my surprise. i read that it would only spread from the original toxic oils from the plant not after exposure. i'm not even very itchy but every day have a new patch of rashes.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you are correct about it appearing to spread based on your original exposure. you may have been exposed by the oils on your clothing or shoes that you touched later or by some of the tools you used to cut it down. the oleoresin is so stable that it can last on objects for years so you better carefully wash any clothing or objects that may have become contaminated. if you have a dog and dog came in contact with poison ivy the oil can be on the fur so wash the dog too. in my opinion there is no such thing as a mild case of poison ivy so i tend to treat them more aggressively (based on my own childhood experience of the misery it causes). prescription prednisone topical steroids and oral antihistamines is the treatment of choice so it is time to consult a medical provider.

what is consider a diabete if your have low sugar level to be 44 then goes up to 67

Actual Doctor's Response:
to diagnose diabetes your doctor may do a fasting blood glucose test. this is a preferred method since it’s easy to do and less expensive than other tests but you have to refrain from eating anything for at least 8 hours priors to testing. also it is normal for your blood sugar to go up after eating. fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 99mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 100 – 125mg/dl diabetic – greater than 126mg/dl non-fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 139mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 140 – 199mg/dl diabetic – greater than 200mg/dl the standard diagnosis of diabetes is made when at least two separate blood tests show that your blood sugar is elevated. based on the information you provided it appears that you have a low blood glucose value. i would actually review this article about hypoglycemia or low blood sugar ( <link> ) since your blood sugar was initially very low on this occasion. keep in mind that even a normal blood glucose test with risk factors (listed here: <link> ) may warrant further testing. it would be best to discuss with your doctor if you have further questions.

Patient Question:
what are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes recently diagnosed?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your (or your child's) symptoms of type 1 diabetes probably developed quickly over a few days to weeks. these symptoms are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia) and include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. if your child has already learned to use the toilet he or she may have started wetting the bed during naps or at night. the kidneys are trying to get rid of the excess sugar in the blood. in order to do that they have to excrete more water. more water means more urine. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. this happens if you lose through frequent urination enough water to become dehydrated. weight loss. this happens because you are dehydrated. weight loss may also happen if you are losing all of those sugar calories in your urine instead of using them. increased hunger. you feel hungry because your body is not using all the calories that it can. many of them are being excreted in urine. blurred vision. your vision may blur when sugar builds up in the lens of your eye. the sugar sucks extra water into your eye which changes the shape of the lens and blurs your vision. fatigue. you feel tired for the same reason you feel hungry. your body is not using the calories you are eating and your body is not getting the energy it needs. all of these symptoms will get better or go away when your blood sugar levels are controlled. if your blood sugar rose to very high levels at the time you were diagnosed with diabetes you may have received treatment in a hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis which is an emergency. what symptoms might i have now? now that you are taking insulin injections watch for signs of either high or low blood sugar. high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) usually develops slowly over a few days or weeks. but it can also develop quickly (in just a few hours) if you eat a large meal or miss an insulin dose. on the other hand low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) can develop within 10 to 15 minutes. children especially very young children are at greater risk for harm caused by very low blood sugar levels. watch for the following symptoms of high or low blood sugar. you (or your child) may not have the same symptoms every time and you may have symptoms that are not listed. symptoms of low blood sugar include sweating weakness and inability to concentrate. severe low blood sugar can cause loss of consciousness and seizures. symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst and increased urination. signs of high or low blood sugar in young children can be confusing but may include paleness and a sudden change in emotion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
my boyfriend and i had sex using both the pill and a condom. the condom broke. should i worry about rubber inside me? . we think most stayed on his shaft and i found a small piece about 3/4 inch x 1/2 inch. like it ripped and a portion tore off. do i have to worry about this causing tss? .

Actual Doctor's Response:
no you will not get tss from a piece of condom (most likely latex not rubber). if there is a retained piece it will not likely cause any problems but you can carefully check with your finger or use a gentle warm water douche to wash out any possible remnants.

i would guess that vaginal dryness is the cause of your primary complaint. the lack of estrogen-a chief post-menopausal culprit. if your vaginal walls are dry the motion of intercourse can make the penis like sandpaper to your delicate tissues. after sex the pinkish discharge could be your body's attempt to recover from the 'chaffing '. also your vagina is more susceptible to overgrowth (infection) of naturally occurring organisms (yeast gardnerella etc) when it is dry. i would see a doctor before attempting self treatment for any sort of vaginosis and she could prescribe or suggest treatment for the dryness. good luck

Patient Question:
what foods should i avoice for meneire's disease? . my doctor told me to eat a "no salt chocolate wine cheese and caffeine diet (a migraine diet? ). can you provide me with an established diet that avoids triggers for meniere's?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the mainstay of a diet for menieres is low sodium typically under 2000mg daily. that means focusing on whole foods that naturally have less sodium over processed foods with sodium added. these foods include fruits vegetables whole grains unprocessed meats and healthy fats. when choosing other items read the label. this list should help you figure out low sodium choices. it's also beneficial to limit caffeine in items like coffee tea and soda. these are other foods high in caffeine. i think the cheese and wine has to do with migraines and not menieres so you'll have to check with your doctor on that. i would focus on sodium first. good luck!

montelukast sodium 5 mg tablet can be given to 4. 5 year child to treat eczema or frequent allergic child? . my son has got rashes over the body. normally it appears when there is fever around 100 f. every month or two he gets these rashes. initially they were limited to chest and back but in subsequent fever it appeared again over body specially on chest back arms and joints. doctor has diagnosed and there is a possibility of eczema or allergic. initially cetirizine hydrochloride 2. 5ml two times a day was given for a more than week. now montelukast sodium 5 mg one tablet a day is advised. .

Actual Doctor's Response:
it makes a lot of sense. it's another non drowsy medication that works to reduce the allergic response over the long term and the 5 milligram chewable is the children's dose. though it's also used to control asthma it is very useful for allergies. here's more information: <link>

how long does a rash last. had a rash all around my mouth for 6 weeks ( just like a go-tee) and nothing is helping hydroclorasone eucerine etc. now it's under one eye and eyelid. the doctor told me it was a rash . it doesn't really itch but it gets quite red and lightens up from time to time. another doc said infection bacteria or fungal. tried anti baceria and fungal cremes to no avail. heeeeeeeeelp!

Actual Doctor's Response:
it would be impossible to predict the outcome of a skin eruption since every person is different when it comes to healing times. additionally it appears that you have not been definitively diagnosed so seeing a dermatologist at this point would be prudent. a "rash" is a very very vague diagnosis. there are thousands of causes so after six weeks of treatment failure i think you need to see a specialist.

Patient Question:
what can you put on bites from fire ants?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you have been stung by a fire ant you should softly wash the skin with a mixture of soap and water; this will get rid of the venom on the surface. if you have rubbing alcohol around you also should disinfect the area of the bites. you can then put some ice in a washcloth and hold it next to the bites for about 15-20 minutes. that will help keep down swelling and make it a little less irritating the next day. fire ant stings are also accompanied by a lot of itching so you may want to use a hydrocortisone or diphenhydramine-based cream. be careful and don't scratch! this could lead to secondary skin infections a trip to the doctor and possibly antibiotic treatment.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal "red blotch". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated.

sexual excitation leading to an ejaculation is controlled in the brain not the penis. the fact that you can continue to have sexual activity after ejaculation is really good so that first "fast one" is really not that problematic (other than changing condoms). yes there are some special techniques you can employ to postpone ejaculation if you have a cooperative partner. a little research on the internet for "premature ejaculation techniques" would likely provide you will ample information. no there are not special foods that will increase your sexual stimina but if you eat a lot of garlic your partner is unlikely to have sex with you at all!

Patient Question:
i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry you're going through this and that it's concerning you. the skin is an amazing organ. one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin's surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm. this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing (a red appearance) and may make the skin feel hot. the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core. i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday? is it because you're exercising for example? are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes? or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day? our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you're getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit. i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally (your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat) but perhaps there's some underlying cause for this that should be checked out. i wish you all the best with this! i have a question for you. do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring? the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating. over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i don't. the heat is trapped inside. not being able to sweat is known as "anhidrosis" research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue. i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways. hope this helps. this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call "empty heat" or "empty fire" "the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general (irrespective of organ) are: - a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening - a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips - malar flush (red cheekbones) - a dry throat at night - a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called a5-palm heat@) - dry stools - scanty-dark urine - a floating-empty and rapid pulse - a red tongue without coating. " <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body. see the url above for more information. western medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms. i would recommend seeing a competent traditional chinese medical doctor in your area preferably one with the degree omd (orental medical doctor) a traditional chinese medical doctor not just a licensed acupuncturist.

can you get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery?

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery. yes i've done it

Actual Doctor's Response:
a fatty liver is reversible. being overweight is one of the many causes for this condition. lose some weight and lose some liver fat. hypothyroidism should not interfere with your losing weight objective. in order to maintain a weight of 200 pounds you're consuming about 1844 calories per day. to reduce your weight by one (1) pound per week reduce your daily calories to about 1344. here is my abbreviated version of a plan that will enable you to eat better and lose some of the excess weight. : - begin by seeing your family doctor and obtain approval to start a reduced calorie diet. eliminating 500 calories from your daily diet can be challenging but will also prove to be rewarding and is achievable. - search the web for free 1300 daily printable diet plans. look for one that includes at least seven (7) days of planning covering three (3) meals per day and snacks. some of these diet plans may even include a printable shopping list and recipes to complete the main courses for each meal. look for diets that use a safe breakdown of calories (55% carbs -15% protein- 30% fats). - drink at least 64 oz. of water each day. - with your doctor's approval start a modest exercise program. a brisk walk will burn about 100 calories per mile while gardening will burn an additional 100 calories in 30 minutes. - take steps to learn dieting do's and do not's. do not skip meals but do learn how to substitute one food for another and how to order a meal at the restaurant while not sabotaging your diet. - keep a diary of foods and beverages consumed along with a record of your weight losses. - reward yourself for accomplishing diet goal objectives (have your nails manicured and painted get a new hair style or purchase a new handbag). - consider joining a dieting support group. you'll hear success stories make new friends and will learn additional tips to making dieting a positive self-improvement venture. best wishes for your success.

penicillin can be harsh on the stomach. it is important to take it with food and not on an empty stomach. your pharmacist may also be able to flavor the medication to make it easier for your son to take. i would make sure the vomiting has subsided before giving him another dose. since i don’t know the original diagnosis or the reason for his penicillin prescription i wouldn’t know if the condition is causing the vomiting or the medication. let his stomach settle a bit and try giving him something small to eat something that will be light on his stomach. see if he can hold this down before giving him another dose of medication. if the vomiting continues consult your health care provider to discuss an option that may be less upsetting to his stomach.

what is fraxel and how does it compare to a co2 laser peel?

Actual Doctor's Response:
fraxel is a non-ablative erbium-glass treatment that has been used to improve acne scars and uneven pigmentation with some success. usually 4-6 treatments are needed. there is usually little down time with redness and scaling for a few days after the treatment. fractional co2 treatments build on the gold-standard co2 resurfacing laser for improvement of lines wrinkles sun damage and other signs of aging. usually only a treatment is needed but it is ablative which means that there is greater recovery time usually about 7-10 days.

Actual Doctor's Response:
commonly hfm is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. information regarding fetal exposure to hfm during pregnancy is limited. no solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects. however should a baby be born to a mother with active hfm symptoms the risk of neonatal infection is high. typically such newborns have a mild illness. rarely overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as liver heart and brain can be lethal.

Patient Question:
what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for bacterial vaginosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your doctor may only test you for bacterial vaginosis if you: have symptoms. are going to have a hysterectomy or surgical abortion ( bacterial vaginosis increases infection risk afterwards). are pregnant and have had a preterm delivery in the past (a past preterm delivery may have been caused by infection). your doctor can diagnose bacterial vaginosis based on your history of symptoms a vaginal examination and a sample of the vaginal discharge. laboratory tests to detect signs of bacterial vaginosis may include: wet mount. a sample of vaginal discharge is mixed with a salt (normal saline) solution after placing it on a microscope slide. the prepared slide is examined to identify the bacteria present to look for white blood cells that indicate an infection and to look for unusual cells called clue cells. the presence of clue cells is the most reliable indicator of bacterial vaginosis. whiff test. several drops of a potassium hydroxide (koh) solution are added to a sample of vaginal discharge to determine whether a strong fishy odor is produced. a fishy odor on the whiff test suggests bacterial vaginosis. vaginal ph. the normal vaginal ph is 3. 8 to 4. 5. bacterial vaginosis usually causes the vaginal ph to rise above 4. 5. gram stain. a sample of the vaginal discharge is placed on a microscope slide. a special dye is applied to the slide causing certain types of bacteria (gram-positive bacteria) to turn a shade of purple while coloring others (gram-negative bacteria) pink. in bacterial vaginosis gram-negative bacteria especially gardnerella vaginalis are most common. oligonucleotide probes. this test detects the genetic material ( dna ) of bacterial vaginosis bacteria. oligonucleotide probe testing is very accurate but is not routinely available in most labs. the presence of clue cells an increased vaginal ph and a positive whiff test are enough evidence to treat for bacterial vaginosis. bacterial vaginosis may be detected during routine pap testing. but pap testing is not a standard test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
why do nipples get hard during exercise? . i'm not cold when i exercise in the gym but my nipples are always erect. what is the physiological response that's taking place?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your nipples most likely become erect during exercise as part of the thermoregulation process of maintaining your body’s internal core temperature or as a result of other stimuli. there doesn’t seem to be a clear agreement for the physiological response that is taking place during exercise specifically but here are a few ideas: • your body heats up during exercise and it produces sweat as a response. your sweat evaporates from your skin removing heat and cooling your body in the process. your nipples can become erect as they are being cooled since coldness is a stimulus for erect nipples. • exercise shirts are designed to be “breathable” by increasing circulation to disperse heat away from your skin. this increased airflow and circulation could compound the cooling effect of evaporation. • your nipples are very sensitive so the continual friction caused by your shirt vigorously moving back and forth as you exercise may be irritating them. • your body may just be at a heightened state of arousal during exercise. this doesn’t mean sexual arousal rather just a physiological state of heighted autonomic arousal that you experience during exercise in the same way that you experience changes to heart rate respiratory rate perspiration etc. erect nipples may just be another natural component of that. try to take notice of when you first experience this happening so that maybe you can better identify what’s triggering it. if it bothers you i would suggest wearing a padded exercise bra if you’re a woman or experiment with different clothing materials for your shirt. try putting your exercise shirt as a base layer and a cotton t-shirt over it to help keep you warm and to cover it up. you can also buy nipple covers or put a band-aid over them to help conceal them.

Patient Question:
how do you get tendinitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
tendonitis is usually caused by overuse of a muscle group or joint. repeated sliding of the tendon during heavy use especially when a person is unaccustomed to it can result in irritation causing pain in and around the tendon. “tennis elbow ” or lateral epicondylitis is an example of tendonitis resulting from overuse or strain. other sports activities (e. g. golf) and chores (house painting) can cause tendonitis too. for some people with tendonitis no repetitive activity can be blamed as a cause; wear-and-tear from aging probably plays a role in these cases of tendonitis. using proper swing mechanics in tennis and golf and trying not to overdo it when starting a new activity are the best ways to avoid tendonitis. should i get an xray to determine whether i have a tendinitis or fracture round my knee?

there are some skills that you can develop to help you improve your ability to manage anger. just like with any other skill set it’s best to practice when you don’t have the pressure of needing to be doing it well in that moment. with this in mind consider the following abcd approach: activity: exercise regularly and then also do it when you feel your anger building. if you don’t already have an exercise routine explore different types of exercise to find the ones you most enjoy (e. g. jogging weight lifting pilates). breathing: deep (or diaphragmatic) breathing can be very helpful in calming down or reducing anxiety. you breathe slowly taking time to pause at the end of each inhale and exhale. with this kind of breathing your stomach will ‘inflate’ like a balloon when you inhale and ‘deflate’ when you exhale. meanwhile your chest will not expand. if this is difficult for you try lying on your back with your knees pulled up and your feet flat on the floor. it can also help to place a hand on your stomach to feel its rise on your inhale. calming activity: find a hobby or activity that you enjoy and can engage in with your full attention. examples are gardening yoga painting or playing music. deepening understanding — of yourself and the other person: it can be extremely helpful to be aware of what ‘pushes your buttons. ’ by fully understanding this you can step back and see it happening which also means that you will not be as caught up in it and can choose to respond differently. so for instance you might say to yourself “there i go again. every time someone even implies that i’m not doing a good job i get furious. ” it can also be helpful to understand the person triggering your anger. chances are that they think their actions are valid; so by understanding their perspective (even if you disagree) you might be able to lessen your own anger and even respond in a way that they can respond more positively to.

Actual Doctor's Response:
dermatologist plastic surgeons and certain ent doctors who are aesthetically trained can inject dermal fillers into the earlobes to create more volume which will make the hole smaller; and this is a temporary fix for this problem. over time if that earlobe continues to stretch if that hole continues to stretch and pull the earlobe down with earrings then it can actually be removed and sown back together and then you can make a new hole to solve that problem on a permanent basis. however it also might help if you wear an earring that has a larger back that gives more support and try not to wear earrings that are too heavy that are going to pull down or if you do wear those once in a while try not to wear them for longer than you absolutely have to.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
it sounds like you're doing a good job caring for your post-surgical wounds. be sure to keep following all the post-surgical instructions you were given. the risk of infection for your procedure is relatively low. the classic signs of infection are: fever loss of appetite feeling like you're coming down with the flu severe pain/swelling/bleeding in the surgical area. if the "gooey pus" you're seeing is yellowish in color chances are good this is not an infection. as the skin heals itself it tends to over-produce protein cells. these cells look kind of yellow gooey and sticky. if that's what you're seeing it's probably a normal part of the healing process. don't scrub these cells off. just gently wash with warm soapy water and rinse well. if your surgeon told you to use antibiotic ointment like bacitracin then continue to do so according to the post-surgical instructions you were given. as your wounds heal you also can apply a vitamin a & vitamin d ointment (often used for diaper rash) to help your skin heal. if you develop a fever or any other signs of a true infection contact your healthcare provider immediately.

it makes me itchy just thinking about lice. you too probably. but learning about these little guys makes it a bit easier to tolerate when your child comes home with them someday! what are lice? the human louse feeds on our hair. and they travel from one head to the next by crawling. no they don’t fly (they are wingless). and lice really like it if you share combs hairbrushes or hats with another person — that way they can be easily transported to a new home on someone else’s head. are lice a sign of poor hygiene? head lice do not care whether you are rich or poor have stellar hygiene or bathe once a week. they are equal opportunity creatures. don’t be embarrassed if your child gets an infestation. grossed out yes. embarrassed no. how do i look for head lice in my child? adult lice are brown and large enough to be seen but they move very quickly. so it’s much more common to diagnose head lice by finding their white eggshells (called nits). the nits stick firmly to the hair shaft close to the scalp. (unlike dandruff that easily brushes out or moves when you shake your head. ) you’ll find them mostly behind the ears and the back of the neck. start looking if your child is suddenly scratching his head for no other good reason (they’re pretty itchy! ). how are lice treated? 1. start with tried and true over-the-counter remedies like rid or nix (1% permethrin or pyrethrin). do one treatment and then repeat seven to 10 days later. 2. don’t obsess about cleaning the entire house! 3. any items that are used in the hair (brushes combs hair clips) can be placed in an airtight plastic bag for four weeks and then they are ready for use again. 4. the problem: lice are becoming increasingly resilient and resistant to treatment. other options include: prescription ulesfia (benzyl alcohol) wash or ovide (malathion). some doctors also prescribe a higher potency permethrin product called elimite. there are also other over-the-counter options. tea tree oil and cetaphil lotion may also treat head lice but the evidence that they work is more anecdotal than scientifically proven. does my child need to stay home until the lice are treated? no. kids often get sent home from school when lice are detected. however this week the american academy of pediatrics (aap) reiterated their position on this outdated strategy: kids should not be excused from school due to head lice. lice are an infestation and they have usually been alive and well on a child’s head for at least four weeks before the itchiness occurs and diagnosis is made. and they do not spread when children are sitting at their desks and learning. so kindly ask your school to check out the aap’s website if they have any concerns.

because ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine it can cause severe and sometimes bloody diarrhea putting patients at risk for iron deficiency and anemia. ulcerative colitis can also deplete stores of folate. that's especially dangerous for women of child-bearing age since folate deficiency is linked to birth defects. fluid loss from diarrhea can also cause electrolyte imbalances. severe infections can occur in the large intestine but they are uncommon. ulcerative colitis is also associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. for that reason doctors recommend frequent colonoscopy examinations. your doctor may discuss other risks with you.

blood transfusions pancolitis and toxic megacolon patients with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum (proctitis) or colitis limited to the end of the left colon (proctosigmoiditis) usually do quite well. brief periodic treatments using oral medications or enemas may be sufficient. serious complications are rare in these patients. in those with more extensive disease blood loss from the inflamed intestines can lead to anemia and may require treatment with iron supplements or even blood transfusions. rarely the colon can acutely dilate to a large size when the inflammation becomes very severe. this condition is called toxic megacolon. patients with toxic megacolon are extremely ill with fever abdominal pain and distention dehydration and malnutrition. unless the patient improves rapidly with medication surgery usually is necessary to prevent colon rupture. in a published scandinavian cohort study of over 500 patients with ulcerative colitis followed for up to 10 years after diagnosis it was found that their mortality rate did not differ from the general population. also the cumulative colectomy rate after 10 years was 9. 8% nearly 50% of the patients were relapse free in the last five years of the study and only 20% of the patients with proctitis or left-sided disease progressed to pancolitis. cancers colon cancer is a recognized complication of chronic ulcerative colitis. the risk for cancer begins to rise after eight to ten years of colitis. patients with only ulcerative proctitis probably do not have increased risk of colon cancer compared to the general population. among patients with active pancolitis (involving the entire colon) for 10 years or longer the risk of colon cancer is increased compared to the general population. in patients with colitis limited to the left side of the colon the risk of colon cancer is increased but not as high as in patients with chronic pancolitis. the current estimates for the cumulative incidence of colon cancer associated with ulcerative colitis are 2. 5% at 10 years 7. 6% at 30 years and 10. 8% at 50 years. patients at higher risk of cancer are patients with positive family histories of colon cancer long durations of colitis extensive colon involvement and primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) another complication of ulcerative colitis. since these cancers have a more favorable outcome when diagnosed and treated at an earlier stage yearly colon examinations may be recommended after eight years of known extensive disease. during these examinations samples of tissue (biopsies) can be taken to search for precancerous changes in the lining cells of the colon. when precancerous changes are found removal of the colon may be necessary to prevent colon cancer. other complications of ulcerative colitis complications of ulcerative colitis can involve other parts of the body. ten percent of the patients can develop inflammation of the joints (arthritis). some patients have low back pain due to arthritis of the sacroiliac joints. ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a type of arthritis that affects the vertebral joints of affected individuals. there seems to be an increased incidence of ankylosing spondylitis among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. rarely patients may develop painful red skin nodules (erythema nodosum). others can have painful red eyes (uveitis episcleritis). because these particular complications can risk permanent vision impairment eye pain or redness are symptoms that require a physician's evaluation. diseases of the liver and bile ducts may also be associated with ulcerative colitis. for example in patients with a rare condition called sclerosing cholangitis repeated infections and inflammation in the bile ducts can lead to recurrent fever yellowing of skin (jaundice) cirrhosis and the need for a liver transplant. finally patients with ulcerative colitis also might have an increased tendency to form blood clots especially in the setting of active disease.

Patient Question:
how much should i weigh?

Actual Doctor's Response:
doctors nutritionists and public health authorities most often use the body mass index to define a healthy weight. body mass index (bmi) is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2). according to the cdc a bmi of less than 18. 5 is considered underweight. a normal bmi falls within the range of 18. 5 to 24. 9. the bmi range of 25. 0 to 29. 9 is considered overweight and a bmi of 30. 0 or higher is considered obese. . obesity increases the risk for diabetes high blood pressure heart attack stroke certain cancers. losing weight reduces your risk. waist size matters too. even in people who are only slightly overweight a waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women increases health risks. don’t believe your pant size; it often underestimates waist circumference. measure your waist yourself with a tape measure just below the belly button.

getting your blood sugar under control quickly is very important. the damage to your body starts well before your blood sugars are in the diabetic range. that's why once we know you have diabetes (or even prediabetes) it's very important to act quickly to get things under control. even once you start medicine it's also very important to continue to work on your weight and exercise. it's wonderful that you're focused on that! once you start medicine it doesn't mean you have to be on it forever. most people with diabetes can actually go off medicine if they get their weight down enough and make the right lifestyle changes. i would encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctor as only he knows your health as well as you do. but it is important to get your blood sugar under control as quickly as possible and your best bet is probably to take the medicine as your doctor suggests remembering it can be just temporary. what are your blood sugar numbers?

Actual Doctor's Response:

Actual Doctor's Response:
you and your husband can purchase separate policies if you prefer. your eligibility for a tax subsidy to help you purchase your policy if you qualify would be based on your household income. so if you are purchasing two policies you would each be able to use half of the credit. whether you should purchase an individual or a family policy based on you and your husband's health circumstances will depend on the policies available to you. you should look at whether the deductible applies to each of you individually or whether there is a family deductible. in the case of the family deductible your husband's health expenses may satisfy the deductible for both of you and it could be advantageous to purchase a family policy vs. two individual policies.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should always have the final say with what goes on with your health and your body. if you believe you have a health condition you did a good thing to express your concerns with your doctor. unfortunately your doctor doesn’t seem to be legitimizing or validating your concerns. your doctor may have good reason however to not support your claims. think back to the explanation that your doctor provided for you – is there any possibility that he or she could be right? research online is great but medical advice from a doctor is of course very credible as well. your doctor may have limited exposure to the condition though so maybe you could find a specialist in the area. it’s important to consider the source of your information. another point to consider is that maybe you didn’t express yourself well enough. print out some of the research that you’ve found and try talking to your doctor about what could be causing some of the specific symptoms. in general it’s also important to consider the test itself too. how accurate and reliable is it? is it invasive or are there risks to having it done? what are the pros and cons of doing the testing? there’s no harm in getting a second opinion. just as different people may have different political views; doctors may have differing medical views as well. maybe you can find a different doctor that will better support your views or help you to understand why testing may not be in your best interest. you always have the right to change doctors especially if you have one who will not listen to your concerns. maybe he is not familiar with this condition called sads. <link>

you ask an interesting question but unfortunately the spread of pathogens doesn't follow a precise course like the one you outline. different pathogens spread in different ways and you also have to take into account the relative "virulence" of the pathogen as well. virulence is a word used to describe a bacterium's ability to infect a host. some viruses and bacteria are considered very "weak. " in other words almost as soon as your immune system attacks them they die off. other pathogens are stronger (more virulent) and are better able to fend off immune system attacks. in general pathogens can be spread through direct contact through the air through water and through other organisms (such as when you get malaria from a mosquito bite). the method of transmission is unique to each type of pathogen. in the scenario you describe let's say someone deposits a pathogen on a vending machine button. let's say it's a hardy pathogen that can reside on the vending machine button for several days before it dies off. each time a person touches the sample containing cells with the pathogen some of those cells stick to the person's finger. eventually all of the pathogenic cells either will have stuck to someone's finger or will have died naturally due to exposure on the metal. if you are the 100th person to contact a live pathogen and pick up even one cell theoretically you could contract an illness from the pathogen. but it depends a lot on how virulent the pathogen is how healthy the person is and so on. your example illustrates why hand-washing is so important. your best defense against transferring a pathogen from a vending machine button to your nose for instance is by washing your hands frequently with good old soap and water. wishing you well!

common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding and diarrhea but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. generally patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. the different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation: ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. in many patients with ulcerative proctitis mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may in addition experience rectal pain urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling) and tenesmus (ineffective painful urge to move one's bowels). proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). symptoms of proctosigmoiditis like that of proctitis include rectal bleeding urgency and tenesmus. some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and the descending colon). symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal cramps weight loss and left-sided abdominal pain. pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon left colon transverse colon and the rectum). symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal pain and cramps weight loss fatigue fever and night sweats. some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. generally however patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration severe abdominal pain protracted diarrhea with bleeding and even shock. they are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colon rupture (perforation). patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. unless they respond to treatment promptly surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colon rupture. while the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. therefore when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his disease the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. nevertheless a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. thus patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis.

the symptoms of ulcerative colitis may include: diarrhea or rectal urgency. some people may have diarrhea 10 to 20 times a day. the urge to go to the bathroom may wake you up at night. rectal bleeding. ulcerative colitis usually causes bloody diarrhea and mucus. you also may have rectal pain and an urgent need to empty your bowels. abdominal pain often described as cramping. your abdomen may be sore when touched. constipation. this symptom may develop depending on what part of the colon is affected. constipation is much less common than diarrhea. loss of appetite. fever. in severe cases fever or other symptoms that affect the entire body may develop. weight loss. ongoing (chronic) symptoms such as diarrhea can lead to weight loss. too few red blood cells ( anemia ). some people develop anemia because of low iron levels caused by bloody stools or intestinal inflammation. you also may have symptoms and complications outside the digestive tract such as joint pain eye problems skin rash or liver disease. but some of these problems are generally more common in crohn's disease the other major inflammatory bowel disease. other conditions with symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis include crohn's disease diverticulitis irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and colon cancer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

boils themselves are not contagious but the bacteria that cause boils are. boils are skin infections commonly caused by the bacteria in the family staphylococcus or by other bacteria. the bacteria manage to temporarily evade the body’s defenses and grow in a tightly defined area. small boils often go away without treatment. in some cases the skin infection may progress to become an abscess: a lump with a pocket of infected liquid (pus) inside. touching someone’s boil then your own skin won’t necessarily cause a boil to form there. the process by which boils form is more complicated than that. the bacteria may spread to the new person’s skin but never cause a boil. some people are more susceptible to boils and skin infections than others. one member of the staphylococcus family called mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) causes a large percentage of boils today. mrsa is spread from person to person in close contact. outbreaks of mrsa have occurred in dormitories military barracks athletic facilities and prisons -- all places where people are in close contact. good personal hygiene is the most sensible approach to prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause skin infections. wash your hands with soap and water after touching a boil. a boil can be kept lightly covered with clean gauze. apply warm-water compresses to help your body clear the infection. if you have a persistent boil or feel you need to squeeze or lance a boil see a doctor. in my family it has been contagious just by walking into the infected persons home with never touching a thing and walking right back out and within 25-48 hours will have one so for us it has been airborn and recently when one gets a boul another gets mrsa well yes yes yes

many types of food poisoning are contagious. you usually get food poisoning from eating food contaminated with bacteria viruses or parasites. however if you have food poisoning it is possible to pass those germs to someone else. some of the most common types that are contagious are salmonella e. coli and norovirus. when you have food poisoning your vomit and feces is full of these germs. that’s why it’s so important to disinfect areas that may be contaminated. for instance if any bacteria remain someone could come along touch that area put their fingers near their mouth and end up with symptoms of food poisoning. other types of food poisoning are caused by toxins produced by bacteria in the food – usually from spoiled food that has been left at room temperature too long. this is a less common type of food poisoning but it’s not contagious from one person to another. you can get it only from eating the contaminated food. but since you may not know exactly which type of food poisoning you have it’s always best to be cautious. fully disinfect any contaminated areas just in case.

Actual Doctor's Response:
good for you for trying to help your partner! i can only imagine how this takes a toll on you. i agree that she should see her doctor again and get a few blood tests done. if she is losing that much blood she may be anemic causing her to feel weak and tired. try to get her to a gyno and go with her if possible. i personally would be most worried about the drinking and paranoia. alcohol is a depressant and is more than likely making things worse though she may feel a bit better at the time she is drinking. there could also be some underlying depression. until she gets to the doctor do your best to be patient and kind. she is clearly not herself at this time and probably feels bad about how she treats you afterwords. try distracting her and getting her to do a bit of excersice (a walk around the park) as it can help some period symptoms. worse comes to worse offer chocolate!

does treatment reverse osteoporosis damage or just stall it?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most treatments for osteoporosis -- like bisphosphonates and serms -- work by slowing down the process of bone loss. since your body is always naturally remodeling bone slowing down the rate of bone loss may allow it to make new bone faster than you lose it. however forteo is the first treatment that directly spurs the growth of bone. it's usually given as an injection once a day in the thigh or abdomen. prolia works to stop bone loss by directing inhibiting cells that remove bone before they cause bone loss.

this is kind of a "loaded" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find "specialists" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that.

while it is uncommon to conceive after having had a tubal ligation it can happen. moreover there is an increased risk of it being a tubal or ectopic pregnancy. thus you were wise to do a reliable pregnancy test given your prior history of super light flows while actually pregnant. if you develop any pregnancy symptoms your should have the test repeated by a gyn or local family planning clinic as an ectopic pregnancy can delay the production of normal amounts of hcg (pregnancy hormone). a more likely explanation for the "too light flow" would be a missed ovulation. if the pregnancy test is negative then the next most common cause of a missed period is not having ovulated that cycle. in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone "stabilizes" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus—as a missed/late period. alternatively just a small amount of the top of the lining can be shed which appears as a very scant flow. causes for not ovulating are many: thyroid problems pituitary problems ovarian cysts physical stressors (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting) emotional stressors (problems with partners children finances) increased body weight anorexia rotating shifts at work etc. you mentioned a prior history of "weird periods" that were "never normal. " that might also suggest alterations in your ovulations. there is a second less common cause for not having a period--or a too light flow. in some women the estrogen levels become very low. the levels are so low that no uterine lining is available to be shed. bottom line repeat the pregnancy test if you have pregnancy signs. if it is negative then you may want to keep a menstrual calendar. if your cycles become absent for three months (or are just minimal spotting) see your gyn or clinic for follow up. certainly if you develop other symptoms such as pelvic pain (e. g. ovarian cyst) get seen promptly. if your tubes are tied its almost if not completely impossible to get pregant. periods are wierd and not really predictable. just dont assume its over yet. wear something for the next few days just to make sure its completely over.

Patient Question:
how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.

an upset stomach is one of the most common discomforts during pregnancy. nausea is a result of hormonal changes and most often occurs early in pregnancy until your body adjusts to the increased production of hormones. nausea can begin in early pregnancy but is usually gone by the fourth month. it can occur at any time of the day but may be worse in the morning when your stomach is empty (this is often called "morning sickness") or if you are not eating enough. recommendations: if nausea is a problem in the morning eat dry foods like cereal toast or crackers before getting out of bed. or try eating a high-protein snack such as lean meat or cheese before going to bed (protein takes longer to digest). eat small meals or snacks every two to three hours rather than three large meals. eat slowly and chew your food completely. sip on fluids throughout the day. avoid large amounts of fluids at one time. try cool clear fruit juices such as apple or grape juice. avoid spicy fried or greasy foods. if you are bothered by strong smells eat foods cold or at room temperature and avoid odors that bother you. talk to your doctor about taking vitamin b6 or other treatments. contact your health care provider if your vomiting is constant or so severe that you can't keep fluids or foods down. this can cause dehydration and should be treated right away.

Actual Doctor's Response:
to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it.

Patient Question:
what factors contribute to a successful nose job?

Actual Doctor's Response:
at consultation the evaluation includes a lot of factors some patients aren’t aware of. it’s not just the shape or size of your nose. it’s the quality the material there that is available to work with. for example thick oily skin tends not to drape down even though you shave down the bump and narrow the tip because what you are doing is narrowing the under the surface structures the bone and the cartilage. but the upholstery meaning the skin it does best when it’s thin and will shrink down uniformly and give a nice contour. so thick skin is a bit of a challenge for us. and oily skin has a greater tendency to have breakouts and all those things that kind of be a bit of a hassle for the patient. and the other question is even the strength of the cartilage because strong cartilages are really ideal because you can work with them easier. people that have very soft cartilage there’s a very narrow window in which you can work because if you’re a little over zealous and take out too much that cartilage is so weak that often the nose will kind of start to collapse and dip down. you’ve got to factor all these things into your decision making but that decision making is done really at the time of consultation. that’s where our most intense thoughts are being hatched because we have the patient in front of us we have the ability to feel to look size up the situation. we need to look inside the nose and see if there’s blockage because often if you make the nose a little narrower and the airway isn’t so super to begin with the patient may note afterwards that gee my breathing isn’t quite as good as it was before what’s going on here? so that patient may need to have the discussion about gee i think we need to open up your air passages a little bit while we’re there because after all the nose is still a functional organ regardless of how good it looks if it doesn’t work the patient is not going to be happy.

sometimes patients are disappointed after rhinoplasty or nose surgery because various changes can evolve negatively in the postoperative period. one of the more common effects is the so-called “dropped tip. ” here’s what that means. initially when seen from the side the profile view the tip sits at a desirable level in relation to the rest of the nose’s profile. but with time the tip actually settles down drops and gives a round or convex appearance to the front half of the profile. it may look like a new bump has formed. there are several reasons why this happens. in most cases such a drop is predictable — and preventable. the first reason is that the surgeon fails to allow for an anticipated drop and therefore incorrectly sets the tip position in reference to the rest of the nasal profile including the bridge. it is well-known among experienced nasal surgeons that there will always be some downward contraction of the tip owing to the fact that their incisions tend to contract. the natural downward pull of gravity and contractile forces from those incisions will tend to make the tip drop. the surgeon must anticipate that during the planning of your operation and during its execution. the second common reason for the tip dropping is that there is not enough strength in the remaining tip cartilage to maintain its position. if the surgeon fails to recognize that the tip cartilage is weak and will not hold its posture after part of it has been removed to narrow the lower half of the nose then such a dropped tip will occur and the profile will be imperfect. an assessment of the prospects of that happening should take place at the consultation as the surgeon feels the strength of the nasal cartilages and makes an estimate as to what percentage of the strength can be maintained after a portion of the cartilage is removed. here is the analogy in architecture and construction: if you weaken a load-bearing support wall too much the roof will sag or come tumbling down. reason number three for the “dropped tip” is that in fact the tip does not drop but the tissue of the nose above the tip rises up and makes it look like the tip has dropped. this is generally due to the surgeon’s failure to anticipate the contraction and tightening that will certainly take place during healing. as swelling diminishes and the tissues begin to weld together an upward elevation of the cartilages in the midportion of the nose can occur. these “upper lateral” cartilages automatically and naturally migrate toward the middle and if they had not been trimmed enough in anticipation of this migration then they tend to rise above the anticipated profile level. thus a profile convexity occurs that makes the tip look as though it has dropped. an illusion has been created. rhinoplasty is a complex operation which requires imagination on the part of the surgeon a working game plan based on anticipated changes and most importantly a knowledge of the consequences of each and every surgical maneuver that takes place during the operation. no wonder rhinoplasty holds its reputation as the most difficult operation in the world of cosmetic plastic surgery. and remember not all plastic surgeons are equipped by training experience or talent to perform it.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is a lot of hype around "detoxing" and "cleansing" these days. most of what you'll hear is untrue and can be just a waste of your time and money. there’s no evidence that detoxing and cleansing has any health benefit. nonetheless there are lifestyle changes you can make to “detox” your body. cutting back on saturated fats daily calories refined grains sugar and sodium can help you reap all kinds of health benefits. instead choose fruits and vegetables whole grains fat-free or low-fat dairy lean protein seafood and healthy fats. detoxification or “detox” is a buzzword that has no medical rational or scientific basis for its claims. the simple fact is that your body already has the full capabilities to remove toxins and if anything you may actually be harming your body through commonly promoted detox pills and diets. if you feel as though you might need a detox try making lifestyle changes through eliminating processed foods eating more whole foods like fruits and vegetables and beginning an exercise routine. check out the following articles for more information regarding detoxification: <link> and <link>. here are some things to do to help you cleanse your body naturally. drink water. exercise and do aerobics. take a fiber supplement. add body cleansing foods to your diet drink green tea use colon cleansers supplement today's many product in market but look on the colopril reviews to get the solution of your problem. 1. by drinking plain water about 2 litres everyday. 2. eat more fibres to induce excretion from our body. 3. eat less frozen or ready made food (fast food) cause it contains preservatives that slow the cleaning or detoxification process. they may also promote more toxic inside our body) 4. drink green tea with much plain water. (must increase your water intake at least for 2 litres or the green tea may harm your body since the medium which is water is insufficient) 5. exercise. 6. smoking and drinking alcohol less. ( they only promote more toxic inside our body. ) 7. practice a healthy life-style. 8. take care your kidney (detoxification process happen there). detoxification does happen and can be done naturally without any medication. detoxification helps in curbing unhealthy cravings for food makes you feel lighter medication if being taken act better and generally promotes a feeling of well being. you can try this with complete switching over to salads and fruits only once a week and drinking plenty of water. for full benefits please adopt naturecure procedures

the short answer is: it depends. the type of plan you have as well as how your employer (assuming you get your insurance through work) has structured benefits will impact how your deductible is met. according to michael thompson of pricewaterhousecoopers’ health and welfare practice most plans have an individual and a family deductible. satisfying your deductible generally works like this: ppos and deductibles with a traditional ppo-style plan (preferred provider organization) if one person in your family meets his or her individual deductible benefits will kick in for that person. “under the traditional ppo approach the individual would be in benefit even though the family deductible has not yet been met ” thompson says. in any case you won’t pay more than the total family deductible before insurance begins to pick up the bill for care meaning if you have five members in your family each member won’t need to meet the individual deductible. high-deductible plans it’s a different story with high deductible hsa-qualified plans. in these arrangements if you’re covering a family it’s the larger family deductible (as opposed to the individual deductible) that must be met in order for your benefits to take effect. “if you have a $1 500 individual deductible and a $3 000 family deductible the plan won’t pay any expenses before the aggregate expenses of the family exceed $3 000 ” thompson says. in some cases thompson says employers offering health insurance may elect to treat their deductibles the same with all plan types which is why you always need to check to be certain how your benefits operate to avoid expenses you didn’t plan for.

what causes a low white blood cell count?

Actual Doctor's Response:
white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. as they mature white blood cells are continually released into the bloodstream. white blood cells circulate throughout the body ready to fight infections. they live about two or three weeks when they are broken down and recycled by the body. a normal white blood cell count is between about 4 500 and 10 000 cells per microliter. many conditions can cause a low white blood cell count: • infection (which usually increases the white blood cell count but may decrease it). • drugs especially chemotherapy. • human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). • severe alcohol abuse. • radiation therapy. • cancer affecting the bone marrow. • connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). many african-americans have a naturally lower white blood cell count. this is caused by a gene mutation that may have evolved as a defense against malaria. most often a low white blood cell count is temporary and improves on its own.

Patient Question:
what causes parkinson's disease?

Actual Doctor's Response:
bodily movements are regulated by a portion of the brain called the basal ganglia whose cells require a proper balance of two substances called dopamine and acetylcholine both involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. in parkinson's cells that produce dopamine begin to degenerate throwing off the balance of these two neurotransmitters. researchers believe that genetics sometimes plays a role in the cellular breakdown. in rare instances parkinson's disease may be caused by a viral infection or by exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides carbon monoxide or the metal manganese. but in the great majority of parkinson's cases the cause is unknown.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra die or become impaired. normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next "relay station" of the brain the corpus striatum to produce smooth purposeful movement. loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. studies have shown that most parkinson's patients have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear. recent studies have shown that people with parkinson's disease also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body such as pulse and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non-motor features seen in parkinson's disease including fatigue and abnormalities of blood pressure regulation. many brain cells of people with parkinson's disease contain lewy bodies -- unusual deposits or clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein along with other proteins. researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of the disease. the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally or they may actually be helpful perhaps by keeping harmful proteins "locked up" so that the cells can function. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson's disease and many more genes have been tentatively linked to the disorder. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson's disease can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson's disease. although the importance of genetics in parkinson's disease is increasingly recognized most researchers believe environmental exposures increase a person's risk of developing the disease. even in familial cases exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 2 3 6-tetrahydropyridine or mptp (found in some kinds of synthetic heroin) that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans. other still-unidentified environmental factors also may cause parkinson's disease in genetically susceptible individuals. viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson's disease. people who developed encephalopathy after a 1918 influenza epidemic were later stricken with severe progressive parkinson's-like symptoms. a group of taiwanese women developed similar symptoms after contracting herpes virus infections. in these women the symptoms which later disappeared were linked to a temporary inflammation of the substantia nigra. several lines of research suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson's disease. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals -- molecules that damage membranes proteins dna and other parts of the cell. this damage is often referred to as oxidative stress. oxidative stress-related changes including free radical damage to dna proteins and fats have been detected in brains of parkinson's disease patients. other research suggests that the cell's protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson's disease causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death. additional studies have found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson's disease may contribute to the death of neurons and that inflammation or overstimulation of cells (because of toxins or other factors) may play a role in the disease. however the precise role of the protein deposits remains unknown. some researchers even speculate that the protein buildup is part of an unsuccessful attempt to protect the cell. while mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson's disease the actual cause of the dopamine cell death is still undetermined.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park further away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. if you prefer a more ambitious routine you can join a gym or try working out at home. try for 30 to 60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity (such as swimming biking walking dancing or jogging) at least three to five times a week. weight training can also help tone your muscles and elevate your resting metabolism rate. (the rate that the body burns fuel for energy) whatever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals.

only your doctor can give you that patient-specific "okay" or you will need to be cleared by another doctor. working out may not be an issue four weeks after mono but if your liver and/or spleen is still enlarged (not all people have this mono-related response) you should avoid contact or collision activities that could injury them. it takes an exam and perhaps an ebv titer (blood test) to know your state of recovery. some people improve rapidly and others do not.

Patient Question:
causes of nausea tightness around mid-section shortness of breath sweating trembling and pain (not heart or anxiety). heart had been checked 1 year ago with all tests possible and everything perfect. electrocardiogram at emergency room showed no change. have gastroparesis and esophageal spasms but have not had an attack like this before. gall bladder removed 1 1/2 years ago. had slightly elevated white count (had sinus infection) and sligtly low potassium level. woke up in the night with nausea and went downhill from there. a lot of pain and trouble breathing with sweating and trembling hands.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i am not able to tell what might be going on particularly since you've had quite a few tests in the past. your condition is too complicated to figure out without the benefit of examining you. you need a doctor to examine you and i would be concerned particularly about the shortness of breath and pain/tightness. that is not something you should ignore. i assume when you had your heart checked it was because of these same types of symptoms. however they should still not be ignored and you should give your doctor a call.

Patient Question:
after having my appendix removed how long should it be until i have the staples from the surgery removed. (on the intestine/inside)

Actual Doctor's Response:
your surgeon's office should have given you instructions on this. usually though staples come out between 10-21 days after surgery. note this is not a "do-it-yourself" deal. your doctor has a special tool to remove the staples without pain or pulling the wound open. in the meantime keep the incision clean. if your doctor told you to apply antibiotic ointment to the incision do so at least once a day. if your doctor did not tell you to apply any ointment to the incision then just leave it dry. never take a hand-held shower wand and use it to "blast" water on the incision at close range. this is a surefire way to force bacteria into the wound. just allow the shower water to run down over the incision and then pat it dry. remember to take it easy when it comes to lifting. your incision is rather fragile for awhile. in fact it takes about six weeks for scar tissue to equal the strength of sutures (below the skin). so be sure to follow all of your post-op instructions and activity restrictions carefully. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you do have a blood flow issue then you should get great results from penile injection therapy (it does not hurt) or a vacuum erection device. if those do not work for you then you can still have a penile implant placed with great results and very happy patients and their spouses. i assume you are seeing a urologist who can discuss these and other options with you. if not you should. if these options were not discussed you may want to seek out urologists who have specialized their practice in ed.

traditionally it was felt that testosterone (t) replacement in men who had low t (called "hypogonadism") would increase the risk for prostate cancer. more recently it has been suggested that it may be better for a man to have a normal t to maintain an average or lower risk for prostate cancer in the future. dr abe morgantaller a noted urology expert in this area and a friend of mine who works in boston has written a lot about this. in your case even though you seem to have a strong family history of prostate cancer it may be very reasonable to give you supplemental t to get your levels to normal. you should see a urologist or an endocrinologist for your specific case. in addition to a normal psa (which you currently have) the doctor should do a digital rectal exam (dre) before starting you on t replacement to make sure this "prostate screening" is also normal. the current most popular way to replace t is with topical gels (androgel or testim) that are rubbed on the skin of the shoulders or upper back or chest daily.

Patient Question:
what is rheumatoid arthritis and how is it different from "old age" arthritis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn on itself attacking tissue that normally helps protect and preserve joint function. during an ra "attack" -- known as a flare -- the immune system sends out a barrage of white blood cells to the affected joint which in turn causes inflammation in the area. it is this inflammation that is responsible for the symptoms of ra including joint swelling and pain. osteoarthritis also known as "old age arthritis" or "wear and tear arthritis" is a natural degeneration of the cartilage between joints that occurs with aging. the degeneration can be worsened by overuse or injury but its impact is limited to the affected joints.

Model's Recommendation:

what are at-home remedies for hives?

Actual Doctor's Response:
one of the best remedies for hives is a soothing bath. add five or six tablespoons of oatmeal and three tablespoons of cornstarch or sodium bicarbonate to your bath water. if you are allergic to specific things such as bee stings or other insect bites certain foods or medications ask your doctor about prescribing an emergency kit containing epinephrine (also called adrenaline) which is an injection used to treat the severe or acute hives of anaphylaxis.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9797
the first step in controlling hives is to identify the cause if possible. once you have identified the source of the problem try to avoid exposure to it in the future. a mild case of hives often disappears on its own after a few hours. a longer-lasting case should respond to the manufacturer's recommended dosage of an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. if your hives don't disappear in a few days see a doctor. if you develop symptoms of angioedema or anaphylaxis get medical help immediately. for chronic or especially troublesome outbreaks of hives your doctor will probably order a course of prescription antihistamines. treatment with oral corticosteroids will sometimes reduce swelling when antihistamines don't work but they are usually reserved for more severe cases. if you have the subsurface welts of angioedema you may require hospitalization.

obviously you should have two vas. cutting just one would not do you much good. under anesthesia he can probe around and find the other one which should be there. it would be highly unlikely that you just have one. you are welcome to get a second opinion from a urologist. if the second person finds both of them then it can be done in the office. by cutting just one and waiting for a negative semen analysis you could end up getting two procedures if you are still having viable sperm so it is best to see if you can get it done completely at one visit.

what’s the best diet for great glutes?

Actual Doctor's Response:
quality: stick to whole foods. abandon processed and refined products because they’re not real food just “food-like” products. i like to call them science fair projects. most are laced with refined sugars that play havoc with your insulin levels resulting in a never-ending appetite for more junk. keep it simple. veggies fruits lean proteins and whole grains. eat smart fats that are healthy and satisfying like avocados and nuts. don’t forget to combine protein and fiber like a high protein greek yogurt with walnuts and blueberries. quantity: even if you’re eating whole foods you still have to rein in the calories and control your portions. steamed raw and grilled veggies especially the watery ones you can feast on. watery not densely sugared fruits are best (apples oranges berries melons). be careful with the whole grains especially bread products rice and pasta. make sure you read the labels and stick with one serving when you eat. you’ll need 4-6 oz of lean protein at any one sitting. frequency: eat a balanced meal or snack every 3-4 hours. if you do you’ll feel satisfied enough to eat less throughout the day resulting in more rapid and effective weight removal. make sure to cut off eating after dinner (which should be ideally no later than 8pm). or if you’re up and moving around after dinner and are truly hungry a 100-150 calorie healthy snack is acceptable like a yogurt or cottage cheese or an ounce of cheese.

at what age or point is the t-score in bone density scans used instead of a z-score?

Actual Doctor's Response:
a z-score compares your bone density to what is normal for someone your age. while a z-score alone is not used to diagnose osteoporosis in premenopausal women it can provide important information. here are some tips to help you understand your z-score: *if your z-score is above -2. 0 your bone density is considered within the ranges expected for your age or normal according to the international society for clinical densitometry (iscd). for example a z-score of 0. 5 -0. 5 and -1. 5 is considered normal for most premenopausal women. *if your z-score is -2. 0 or lower your bone density is considered below the expected range. examples are -2. 1 -2. 3 and -2. 5. if your z-score is in this range your health-care provider will consider your health history and possible causes of bone loss including secondary osteoporosis before making a diagnosis of osteoporosis. *if your z-score is normal but you've broken one or more bones from a minor injury your health-care provider may diagnose you with osteoporosis because some people with normal bone density break bones easily. as mentioned above a bone density test will also show a t-score. a t-score compares bone density to what is normal in a healthy 30-year-old adult.

the good old-fashioned exercise treadmill test remains one of the most powerful diagnostic tests we have to assess a person’s cardiovascular risk. a stress test typically consists of a brisk walk on a treadmill according to a protocol of increasing speed and elevation. electrocardiographic monitoring documents abnormal heart rhythms and other indicators that your heart is under stress from lack of oxygen during exercise. these more sophisticated measurements coupled with simpler signs like heart rate blood pressure and exercise duration help your doctor better understand your level of fitness and your risk of having coronary artery disease. but the latest research suggests that we haven’t been doing it entirely the right way… for about half of the population. you have probably heard that if you subtract your age from 220 you will get your predicted maximal heart rate. that is if you’re a man. the research studies that gave us this equation were performed on men back in the 1970’s. and like many studies performed on men (and like many things in the 1970’s in general) the results don’t always apply to women today. so a group of researchers at northwestern university decided to tackle this question by monitoring exercise tests in over 5 000 women and looked for correlations between heart rate and increasing risk for heart attacks. their data resulted in a new improved and gender-appropriate calculation of 206 minus 0. 88 of a women’s age to predict maximal heart rate. the changes between the old and the new calculations might result in small differences in the peak heart rates doctors might expect you to achieve or the targets that might be used in exercise testing or even when you’re at the gym. it’s interesting information but is it useful? for years stress tests have been used to estimate cardiovascular risk with excellent track records in both women and men despite using the same calculations. occasionally a stress test is considered suboptimal or less diagnostic if a person does not achieve a particular heart rate. now that the threshold is different this may result in more “conclusive” tests. but how should this impact your workout? while treadmills and elliptical machines present information about heart rate and zones for “fat burning” and “cardiovascular training ” the reality is that tailoring your workout to your heart rate is not as important as tailoring it to how you feel. you can have an excellent workout at a lower or higher heart rate depending on what you do and how long you are doing it. and tailoring your workout to your age (by using the heart rate calculation) just seems sort of depressing. the bottom line is that you should exercise consistently and to the best of your ability — regardless of your heart rate age or sex. competitive athletes and gadget hounds will find this new information helpful in gauging the intensity of a particular workout but for the rest of us the most important calculation is how to find time to get to the gym in the first place.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the low estrogen level could be the result of stress hormones on the brain and not early menopause. depression can cause alterations in the complex interaction of hormones that result in monthly periods. restoring balance into your life by treating depression might be all you need to regularize your periods. yet other hormones should also be analyzed. simple blood or urine test are needed to determine whether this is the result of depression or something directly hormonal. premature ovarian failure elevated prolactin levels thyroid disease etc occasionally more specialized stimulation test are needed as is a referral to a hormone specialist such as an endocrinologist or reproductive endocrinologist. for now protecting your bones is utterly important until a definite diagnosis is made. a diet rich in calcium vitamin d and estrogen are considerations to prevent bone loss and restore periods. birth control is an option given your age but a more intensive evaluation is needed first.

hi try these for help. vitamin e is vital to scalp circulation and cell regeneration both necessary for hair growth. the daily recommended dose is 15 to 19mg. vitamin c is a natural antioxidant and helps maintain healthy hair. it aids in synthesis of collagen and is readily available in the diet. the daily recommended dose is 90 to 120mg. biotin deserves special mention. it is also a b vitamin but its importance in the role of hair growth cannot be overstated. while it can be consumed it was once said by clinical researcher andrew lessman that thousands of calories would have to be eaten to get the amount of biotin needed to make a difference. it promotes hair growth and is crucial to prevent hair dryness. the daily recommended dose is 30mcg. b complex just as the name suggests the bs are complex. there are many of them and some of them depend on one another in order to function. b12 can be responsible for hair loss by itself simply due to a deficiency. frequently injections of b12 can resolve hair loss issues. it is not stored well by the body and is required for the body's use of oxygen and for metabolism. it is needed for activation of b6 and helps in creating niacin. b12 is most absorbable when taken with vitamin c and the daily recommended dose is 50mg. b6 is also thought to prevent hair loss. it also aids in hair coloring and has a major role in creation of niacin which is needed for healthy circulation. b6 must be entirely obtained through diet or supplementation because the human body cannot synthesize it by itself. the daily recommended dose ranges from 1. 3 to 2mg. b3 also known as niacin is thought to reduce cholesterol in the scalp which inhibits hair growth. it is also essential for healthy blood circulation to the body and scalp. the daily recommended dose is 16 to 18mg. vitamin a is an antioxidant that aids in scalp oil production. it's important to note that excess amounts of vitamin a can have undesirable effects by inhibiting hair growth and can even be toxic. the daily recommended dose is 5 000 iu however the linus pauling institute of oregon university has noted increased risk of developing bone diseases such as osteoporosis associated with 5 000iu intake and therefore some supplement manufacturers have reduced content to 2 500i this above info come from livestrong com once a month you could also try giving your hair the olive oil treatment leave it on for a hour before washing it out great for hair health. do hope this helps you and your hair. good luck

Patient Question:
what are the chances of becoming pregnant while using a contraceptive and no condom?

Actual Doctor's Response:
they say the odds are like 0. 1%. personally i lack faith in that since my oldest niece and my youngest son were conceived on birth control without missing any pills. but it is unlikely. but a condom is still important. birth control does not protect from stds. so unless you know for a fact that your partner is free of all stds its always best to use a condom.

maybe if specifically prescribed by your medical provider for this purpose. i caution you against any self-treatment with steroids if this was your intent. i was given a direct injection in my bursae of cortisone which is quite different that taking it orally. if you look up definition of bursitis symptoms and treatment this is one of the recommended treatments. i recently had a fractured femur and am post operative three months and overdid my activity and got this pain i never have had before but with researching bursitis it was like a checklist item. thank goodness i had a follow up post surgical appointment and told my orthopedic doctor he did x-rays of my hip femoral head and the bump swelling i got on the side of my leg definitely follows the symptoms of bursitis. the doctor did not say "you have bursitis" but gave me a cortisone injection quickly after seeing the "bursae bump" as i call it. that is the only thing i fault him for but am glad i came here and coming from the medical field knew it had to be a bursae as it did not feel like muscle or nerve although i did have sharp sudden pain when it first started. i had been gardening as i was feeling better but think i over did it so i am "resting" the area but doing the band exercise gently as recommended by my doctor to strengthen my muscles around my surgical site. so i get to add this incident to now knowing what bursitis feels like. hope this helps someone else get help and evaluated by their doctor.

one of the easiest and convenient ways to add flax-seeds to your diet is by using flax-seed meal. most grocery stores sell it -- the seeds are already ground up for you. simply add spoonfuls to cereal like oatmeal baked goods (like pancakes and muffins) and in smoothies. it really doesn't have a taste (a bit nutty) and it's a great way to get more omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. for more recipes and info on the benefits of flax-seeds see this webmd article.

Patient Question:
how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food

broccoli is a great vegetable and can add texture flavor and nutrition quickly and easily. start your day with an extra boost of vitamin c (not just from orange juice) by tossing broccoli into your breakfast scramble or omelet. add it to your lunch by finely chopping it and stir into soup or toss in a salad raw. break out of the “steamed” box at dinner and change up the side dish by roasting broccoli in the oven. the trick is to use a high heat (450 degrees) for 5-7 minutes. first slice a head of broccoli into quarter-inch to half-inch pieces. spread them out on a sheet pan drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and splash with soy sauce and sesame seeds. another variation is to drizzle with extra virgin olive oil sea salt and fresh chopped herbs. finally try adding a minced shallot and a dash of sea salt and red pepper chili flakes. again all of these variations are completed within 5-7 minutes in a hot oven. and you can use this method with many different vegetables including swiss chard kale cauliflower and asparagus. my shortcut when i’m teaching classes is: “olive oil salt pepper heat. ” it’s an easy way to remember a great tip on preparing delicious veggies quickly. i haven’t come up with any broccoli desserts but if i get inspired i will let you know! you will not hear me advocating for you to sneak them into a brownie or cake — i am passionately convinced that if you make a vegetable delicious and not overcooked you will never need to hide or sneak them into your meals! with your other three meals you can find many ways to utilize this inexpensive nutritious and delicious vegetable.

a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be suspected in patients with fatigue cold intolerance constipation and dry flaky skin. a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. when hypothyroidism is present the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually decreased. however in early hypothyroidism the level of thyroid hormones (t3 and t4) may be normal. therefore the main tool for the detection of hyperthyroidism is the measurement of tsh the thyroid stimulating hormone. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if a decrease of thyroid hormone occurs the pituitary gland reacts by producing more tsh and the blood tsh level increases in an attempt to encourage thyroid hormone production. this increase in tsh can actually precede the fall in thyroid hormones by months or years. thus the measurement of tsh should be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism. however there is one exception. if the decrease in thyroid hormone is actually due to a defect of the pituitary or hypothalamus then the levels of tsh are abnormally low. this kind of thyroid disease is known as "secondary" or "tertiary" hypothyroidism. a special test known as the trh test can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. this test requires an injection of the trh hormone and is performed by an endocrinologist (hormone specialist). blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism but does not point to an underlying cause. a combination of the patient's clinical history antibody screening and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the precise underlying thyroid problem more clearly. if a pituitary or hypothalamic cause is suspected an mri of the brain and other studies may be warranted. these investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Patient Question:
sharp back neck and arm pain on the left side. this began suddenly about 12 hours ago. the pain worsens with movement such as using my left arm turning my head to the left or lifting my head in general. the main spot of pain feels like it's near my spine just under my left shoulderblade. if i sneeze the pain shoots up and down on my spine and out to my left arm occasionally leaving a numbness in my left hand. i am not an "active" person i primarilly work at my computer every day.

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should see your doctor. sharp pain like that could be a sign of something serious but there is no way to know without seeing your doctor. this sounds like a pinched nerve or possibly nerve damage. cat/mri will be required for diagnosis.

Patient Question:
is hpv contagious?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hpv or human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted disease. it's usually detected as warts in the genital area of women and men. hpv is a serious disease that can cause several types of cancer including cervical cancer. hpv most certainly is contagious. hpv is transmitted by direct sexual contact with a person who has the virus. unfortunately many people who have hpv do not know it because they have no symptoms. using a condom during sexual encounters may help minimize your risk of getting hpv from a sex partner. two vaccines have been developed in recent years that can protect you from getting hpv. the vaccines will not cure hpv if you already have it. the centers for disease control and prevention recommend young women and men receive the vaccine to protect against getting and spreading hpv. you may want to speak with your healthcare provider to get more information about hpv and the two vaccines. hpv is contagious. there is a vaccine for girls but there is not one for boys. also i don't think there is a test that males can take to find out if they have hpv - but there is one for girls.

Patient Question:
how does touch impact my sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
what do i mean by touch? well touch is everything from sheets to your mattress and to your pillow. there’s lots of different theories and thoughts out there but one of the things i can tell you is that if you’re not comfortable on the surface on which you sleep and the system in which you sleep you will get a bad night’s rest. and that’s one of the things i talk about with my my boomers is you know let’s make that bed as comfortable as possible. most people don’t know this statistic and it’s kind of gross but so i’m gonna warn you but the weight of your mattress will double every 7 to 8 years based on oil sweat and dust mites. it’s pretty gross but the truth of that matter is people don’t change their mattress enough. you can only imagine what this does to your pillow. so you need to be changing your pillow probably about once every 18 – 24 months you need to be changing your mattress about every 7 years. sheets are another factor. the truth of the matter is sheets anything over 450 threads it’s almost impossible to get more than 450 – 500 threads in a square inch and that’s how they measure sheets by thread counts. there is a thread count myth out there. if you buy a 1 000 thread count sheet it’s actually 2 500 thread count woven together. so it may last a little bit longer but it’s not going to get you any softer than a 450 to 500 thread count sheet.

Actual Doctor's Response:
to avoid a serious reaction to a bee or wasp sting carry a bee-sting kit (be sure you know how to administer a self-injection). you should also wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace describing your allergy. if you have had a severe reaction to a sting and a positive venom skin test venom immunotherapy -- a series of weekly shots of venom -- works well to prevent anaphylaxis. reduce your chances of being stung by avoiding brightly colored white or pastel clothing. don't use cosmetics or perfume with floral scents. food odors attract insects especially yellow jackets so be alert when you are cooking or eating outdoors.

the first thing to do for an earache is to find out why it’s aching. the main concern would be for acute otitis media an infection of the middle ear (the space behind the eardrum). acute otitis media causes pain and sometimes decreased hearing in one or both ears. acute otitis media is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. your doctor can diagnose acute otitis media by looking in your ear with an otoscope. in acute otitis media the eardrum (tympanic membrane) is often swollen and inflamed and fluid sometimes builds up behind it. another cause of ear pain is inflammation of the outer ear or ear canal called otitis externa or "swimmer's ear. " otitis externa is sometimes caused by an infectious agent. your doctor can perform an ear exam and determine the appropriate treatment.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the common cold is a self-limited contagious illness that can be caused by a number of different types of viruses. the common cold is medically referred to as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. symptoms of the common cold may include cough sore throat nasal congestion runny nose and sneezing. more than 200 different types of viruses are known to cause the common cold with rhinovirus causing approximately 30%-35% of all adult colds. other commonly implicated viruses include coronavirus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. because so many different viruses can cause a cold and because new cold viruses constantly develop the body never builds up resistance against all of them. for this reason colds are a frequent and recurring problem. in fact children in preschool and elementary school can have six to 12 colds per year while adolescents and adults typically have two to four colds per year. the common cold occurs most frequently during the fall and winter months. the common cold is the most frequently occurring illness in the world and it is a leading cause of doctor visits and missed days from school and work. it is estimated that individuals in the united states suffer 1 billion colds per year with approximately 22 million days of school absences recorded annually.

Patient Question:
can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck

Actual Doctor's Response:
sometimes a person wants to be pregnant so desperately that their brain creates a false-pregnancy. i had one patient who had a complete hysterectomy that even sent out birth announcements and started wearing pregnancy clothes. she wanted a miracle birth where none could exist. could it be that this person was experiencing a similar false-pregancy and a "loss" of that pregnancy? this person may have lost a "child" that never really existed except in her own mind. i do not know any of the details of this case as you know so i can only speculate. if there is medical evidence like ultrasound results pregnancy tests etc. only she has the right to reveal it. or not. she may need some psychological help not trouble her for documentation to prove or disprove her story. she has experienced a loss but perhaps the loss was her inability to ever have a child because of the hysterectomy. this can be very very difficult for a woman who wanted a child so desperately that her mind may have created one. i trust that you will approach this with sensitivity and understanding. my heart goes out to all of you.

acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease. normally acne develops between the age of 12-25 years. however acne is not limited to any particular age group. as people grow and become older or in younger people acne is becoming a point of concern. acne is known as the disease of the pilosebaceous units (psus). psus are found underneath the skin surface but are more in number on the face back and chest. psus consist of oil glands (sebaceous gland). these oil glands secrete oil to the skin which makes skin moisturized and soft. but in case of any pathophysiological changes in these glands due to external or internal factors can lead to acne this can be either be blackheads or whiteheads. for more information on this you can visit drugsdropship24. the acne triggering factors are listed below: oil glands are over stimulated by increase secretion of sex hormones called androgens that release in both boys and girls during adolescence. diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome and cushing's syndrome hormonal changes due to menstruation pregnancy or hormonal therapy like birth control pills cosmetic mostly moisturizers and oily preparations genetics pathogenic invasion like propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis secondary physical factors such as diet personal hygiene (dirt sweat) and stress incidence of acne on the basis of age: acne affects 90% teenagers. acne generally begins with the onset of adolescence when androgen concentration begins to increase in the body on the basis of gender: acne is more common in males than females during puberty. however during adulthood due to hormonal changes women become prone to acne.

Patient Question:
what other conditions can cause dementia?

Actual Doctor's Response:
doctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. many of these conditions are reversible with appropriate treatment. reactions to medications. medications can sometimes lead to reactions or side effects that mimic dementia. these dementia-like effects can occur in reaction to just one drug or they can result from drug interactions. they may have a rapid onset or they may develop slowly over time. metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. thyroid problems can lead to apathy depression or dementia. hypoglycemia a condition in which there is not enough sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion or personality changes. too little or too much sodium or calcium can also trigger mental changes. some people have an impaired ability to absorb vitamin b12 which creates a condition called pernicious anemia that can cause personality changes irritability or depression. tests can determine if any of these problems are present. nutritional deficiencies. deficiencies of thiamine (vitamin b1) frequently result from chronic alcoholism and can seriously impair mental abilities in particular memories of recent events. severe deficiency of vitamin b6 can cause a neurological illness called pellagra that may include dementia. deficiencies of vitamin b12 also have been linked to dementia in some cases. dehydration can also cause mental impairment that can resemble dementia. infections. many infections can cause neurological symptoms including confusion or delirium due to fever or other side effects of the body's fight to overcome the infection. meningitis and encephalitis which are infections of the brain or the membrane that covers it can cause confusion sudden severe dementia withdrawal from social interaction impaired judgment or memory loss. untreated syphilis also can damage the nervous system and cause dementia. in rare cases lyme disease can cause memory or thinking difficulties. people in the advanced stages of aids also may develop a form of dementia (see hiv-associated dementia page 14). people with compromised immune systems such as those with leukemia and aids may also develop an infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). pml is caused by a common human polyomavirus jc virus and leads to damage or destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells. pml can lead to confusion difficulty with thinking or speaking and other mental problems. subdural hematomas. subdural hematomas or bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer covering (the dura) can cause dementia-like symptoms and changes in mental function. poisoning. exposure to lead other heavy metals or other poisonous substances can lead to symptoms of dementia. these symptoms may or may not resolve after treatment depending on how badly the brain is damaged. people who have abused substances such as alcohol and recreational drugs sometimes display signs of dementia even after the substance abuse has ended. this condition is known as substance-induced persisting dementia. brain tumors. in rare cases people with brain tumors may develop dementia because of damage to their brains. symptoms may include changes in personality psychotic episodes or problems with speech language thinking and memory. anoxia. anoxia and a related term hypoxia are often used interchangeably to describe a state in which there is a diminished supply of oxygen to an organ's tissues. anoxia may be caused by many different problems including heart attack heart surgery severe asthma smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation high-altitude exposure strangulation or an overdose of anesthesia. in severe cases of anoxia the patient may be in a stupor or a coma for periods ranging from hours to days weeks or months. recovery depends on the severity of the oxygen deprivation. as recovery proceeds a variety of psychological and neurological abnormalities such as dementia or psychosis may occur. the person also may experience confusion personality changes hallucinations or memory loss. heart and lung problems. the brain requires a high level of oxygen in order to carry out its normal functions. therefore problems such as chronic lung disease or heart problems that prevent the brain from receiving adequate oxygen can starve brain cells and lead to the symptoms of dementia.

chlamydia which strikes over 4 million americans a year is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the u. s. epidemiologists believe it's twice as common as gonorrhea and 30 times as common as syphilis. the good news is that chlamydia is easily cured by antibiotics. the bad news is that 50% of women who contract the disease don't know they are infected and 30% develop serious complications such as damage to the fallopian tubes (the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus) causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in sterility. untreated chlamydia infection can also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus) and premature birth. the infection can be passed on to an unborn child and cause serious complications. babies born to infected mothers may suffer from pneumonia or conjunctivitis an inflammation of membranes in the eye that may lead to blindness. fifty percent of infected men also have no symptoms. they may develop epididymitis an inflammation of the male sexual organs that can cause sterility. men can develop discharge from their penis or burning when urinating.

Patient Question:
can an antihistamine allergy pill be taken with high blood pressure medication?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most antihistamines are safe to use with medications for high blood pressure. but i would avoid the ones that also contain a decongestant as these may raise blood pressure. i would need to know which medications you take in order to provide a more precise answer. you should talk to your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medications especially if you have high blood pressure.

it is important to watch what over-the-counter medications are taken with prescription medications. steroids such as prednisone can be harsh on the stomach. the same holds true with ibuprofen. if it is for temporary use separate out the doses and take with food. aspirin and prednisone have a mild drug interaction and is more of a concern when tapering or taking someone off steroid therapy. always consult your pharmacist or health care provider with your specific request and to discuss the reasons you want to use the combination of therapy before using it.

there are four phases to a diet after having gastric bypass surgery. phase 1 is a liquid diet and can be started 1 to 2 days after surgery. phase 2 is pureed foods and this can be started a few days after starting phase one. phase 3 is a soft solid foods diet and can be started after a few weeks. these foods include ground meats canned or soft fruits and cooked vegetables. phase 4 is the solid foods diet where you can gradually return to eating firmer foods. your doctor or dietitian will guide you through the diet phases above. three to four months after the surgery you can start to return to a normal healthy diet. keep meals small and sip on liquids slowly throughout the day. each meal should include about a half-cup to a cup of food. always consult with your doctor before proceeding through the phases.

excedrin is a nonprescription medication that contains acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. aleve is a nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) and its active ingredient is naproxen. the aspirin in excedrin and the aleve (naproxen) are similar medications and are used for similar things. aleve itself can be used for a migraine. and excedrin can be used as well. if you are taking the aleve chronically (all the time) for something other than migraine (like pain) and you have tried the aleve for the migraine and it hasn’t helped then go ahead and try the excedrin. you can take both together for a short period of time. the biggest side effect you might notice is increased bleeding or bruising.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're suffering like this. it's bad enough to take on a new job without then coming down with mysterious physical symptoms! unfortunately it's impossible to tell whether this is serious or not. obviously you should know the symptoms of a heart attack and also know the risk factors for heart disease. while anyone can have a heart attack it's more likely among people with multiple risk factors. i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to evaluate your symptoms. your provider probably will want to run some tests such as blood work or possibly and ekg. many medical conditions could cause the symptoms you describe including low thyroid. your health care provider can correlate your health history with your new symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis. i hope you feel better soon!

Actual Doctor's Response:
it's always concerning to have unexpected after-effects from surgery. the pain you're describing isn't unusual after an anterior cervical discectomy. the surgical positioning for that procedure can cause upper back muscle stiffness and soreness that lingers. in addition sometimes as the previously compressed spinal nerves come back to life they can cause tingling shooting or stabbing pain in areas where sensation previously was limited. all that said if your post-surgical pain is getting worse instead of better it's always a good idea to call your surgeon's office and speak to the nurse or physician assistant (pa). he or she can tell you what's expected in terms of pain and the general course of recovery. best of luck to you!

several problems can cause pain in the area of the ovary. if the pain started after your surgery then you may have developed scar tissue that can cause a pulling sensation or sharp pains with movement bowel movements or intercourse. if the pain was there prior to having surgery it is likely it was never due to the ovary to begin with. pain in this area can be caused by endometriosis trigger points (sensitive areas in the soft tissues like muscle) joint (hip) disease bladder disorders colon disorders and many others. pain can also be referred from other areas so it feels like it is the ovarian area but it is actually originating from somewhere else. you should discuss this pain with your doctor. the pain in the belly button may just take some time to improve but you may also have a hernia. again i would recommend that you see your doctor for an exam.

3 questions: does pheromone sprays work does ion/power bracelets work does penis enlargement pills/exercises work?

Actual Doctor's Response:
no these are all basically worthless "quack" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sweating problems are common in fm because of the autonomic nerve dysfunction. the sweat glands receive nerve supply from specific autonomic nerves called sympathetic sudomotor nerves. sweating regulates our body temperature (called thermoregulation). in fm dysutonomia is present and causes too much sweating usually but sometimes the opposite occurs and our skin can be too dry. throw in the usual suspects that overstimulate our autonomics: weather changes heat sunlight certain meds esp ssri's & snri's position changes i. e. laying down stress exercise attempts etc. and we become bona fide sweating machines! treatments for excessive sweating are limited. i advise my patients to avoid aggravating factors if they can use antiperspirants not deodorants and sometimes an anti-cholinergic medicine can be tried. work with your doc.

well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the flu--or influenza --can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot "cause" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well!

" a broken rib can indeed puncture your lung. in fact it's not all that uncommon. if you watch any of those real-life trauma shows on television you will see emergency room personnel placing chest tubes in patients due to collapsed lungs and you can bet some of those collapses occurred due to fractured ribs. but if by "cracked" you mean "not completely fractured or displaced " then the answer probably is "no. " when a rub breaks and the two sides pull away from each other then one of them can puncture the lung. if a rib is "cracked" but the ends never comes apart then it's unlikely to penetrate the tissue surrounding the lung. on the other hand if you took a forceful blow to the chest that alone could cause a collapsed (not "ruptured") lung. so if you experienced chest trauma sufficient to crack a rib you certainly could experience a pneumothorax. surprisingly you can experience a collapsed lung without any known cause whatsoever. wishing you well!

well if by "automatically" you mean the virus jumps across space and into your system then no. transmitting herpes requires skin-to-skin contact. it's generally advisable to avoid having sex with your partner when he or she is having an active outbreak of genital herpes. the problem is that a condom may not cover all of the skin areas that could come into contact with the lesions. if you have unprotected sex with a partner who is having an active herpes outbreak the chances are very high you will also get the disease. genital herpes is incurable so once you have it you have it for life. if you have had protected or unprotected sex with someone who is having an active outbreak of genital herpes and you want to know if you contracted the virus you can consult a medical professional for blood testing to find out. you also should avoid sleeping nude with someone who's having an outbreak of genital herpes. any skin-to-skin contact in the genital region can transmit the virus. i hope this helps!

there are two forms of hepatitis c. the first form is called acute hepatitis c which means that you recently became infected with the virus. the second form is called chronic hepatitis c which means that you have had an infection for more than 6 months. most people who are infected with hepatitis c develop chronic hepatitis c. but even people who have been infected for a while usually do not have symptoms. this makes it common for people to have hepatitis c for 15 years or longer before it is diagnosed. many people find out by accident that they have the virus such as when donating blood or having a routine physical exam. if symptoms do develop they may include: fatigue. joint pain. belly pain. itchy skin. sore muscles. dark urine. jaundice a condition in which the skin and the whites of the eyes look yellow. hepatitis c damages your liver very slowly. about 25% of people who have long-term (chronic) hepatitis c will go on to develop severe liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis) after a period of about 20 years or more. 1 if you develop cirrhosis you may have: redness on the palms of your hands caused by expanded small blood vessels. clusters of blood vessels just below the skin that look like tiny red spiders and usually appear on your chest shoulders and face. swelling of your belly legs and feet. muscle shrinking. bleeding from enlarged veins in your digestive tract which is called variceal bleeding. variceal bleeding can be very serious even though you may not have previous symptoms of the problem. damage to your brain and nervous system which is called encephalopathy. encephalopathy can cause symptoms such as confusion and memory and concentration problems. many other health problems are associated with long-term cirrhosis. for more information see the topic cirrhosis. there also are many other conditions with similar symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i am not a doctor just another mother. my kids are now ages 27 21 and 16. i would take my children to the doctor pretty quickly (within a day or so) for fever as high as 103 degree f. although many times the dr. would say it was something that would pass on it's own and just to provide fever medication and make them comfortable i never wanted to take a chance that it was something serious that we could catch early. i would consider the following: does the fever reduce with medication? if so than you can keep it under control for now. if not you might use that as criteria to go on in. is the child drinking normal amounts or more? if so that is another good sign. fever can really dehydrate someone. if he/she refuses fluids can't keep them down or is drinking less than normal again i might use that as criteria to take the child in. i never used eating as a criteria while a child had fever as long as they could keep something down and would eat a little. other mothers may disagree with this. this last bit is what my mother a registered nurse told me: if in doubt call or take the child in. you'd rather err on the side of caution when it comes to kids.

most helpful answer hi see a uro first perhaps he will have other ideas to what treatment you need. worth a try. found you this piece of info. any other situation that raises the temperature of a man's testis for a long period of time might affect his sperm count and cause infertility. wearing tight or heavy clothing that insulates the scrotal area can raise scrotal temperature by 1 or 2 degrees fahrenheit which could lower sperm count over time although this has not been proven conclusively in research studies. taking long hot baths or using a sauna might also raise testicular temperature after about 10 minutes of exposure to heat which could also lower sperm output if this happens regularly. a study published in october 2012 in "spermatogenesis" suggests obesity and a large belly might cause increased testicular temperature and contribute to decreased sperm counts and infertility. this possibility is somewhat controversial and needs confirmation in additional carefully controlled studies good luck

Patient Question:
i am on birth control. i experienced light bleeding for a couple of days after my cycle ended. what could be happening?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are a couple of possible explanations for this light spotting. the most common one would be light breakthrough bleeding due to the hormones in your birth control pill (bcp). with prolonged bcp use the lining of the uterus can become thinner. this can make it easier for spotting to occur. often such spotting will present after intercourse or even heavy exercise. typically it does not develop into a full on "period-like" bleed. other reasons for spotting after sex can include problems with the face of your cervix. for example if you have a new infection with chlamydia that can make the cervix friable (easier to bleed when touched by fingers penis etc). if you had a polyp in the cervical canal the polyp tissue is very fragile and bleeds easily. . my best guess is bcp caused spotting. if the spotting persists or you have risks for chlamydia (e. g. new partner or multiple partners) you should see your gyn of clinic for follow up. if the bcp is the culprit for the poor cycle control a change in bcp formula or brand can be helpful.

the most important part of any pulmonary rehabilitation program for copd is exercise. all pulmonary rehab centers offer exercises to improve physical fitness. some pulmonary rehab centers provide an exercise program only. other centers provide access to specialists education and psychological support in addition to exercises. pulmonary rehab exercises include: lower-body exercises: most pulmonary rehab centers provide a regimen of exercises that centers on leg workouts. these exercises vary from simple walking on a treadmill or around a track to more intense stair climbing. most of the proven benefits of pulmonary rehab come from studies in people doing leg exercises. upper-body exercises: the muscles in the upper body are important for breathing as well as daily activities. arm and chest exercises might include turning a crank against resistance or simply repetitively lifting the arms against gravity. exercises for breathing muscles: breathing through a mouthpiece against resistance during pulmonary rehab may increase the strength of the breathing muscles. these exercises are infrequently used but may be helpful for people with very weak breathing muscles. strength training : most pulmonary rehab exercises concentrate on building endurance. adding strength training like lifting weights has been shown to increase muscle strength and bulk as well.

Patient Question:
what causes eczema?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the exact cause of eczema is unknown but it's thought to be linked to an overactive response by the body's immune system to unknown triggers. in addition eczema is commonly found in families with a history of other allergies or asthma. some people may suffer "flare-ups" of the itchy rash in response to certain substances or conditions. for some coming into contact with rough or coarse materials may cause the skin to become itchy. for others feeling too hot or too cold exposure to certain household products like soap or detergent or coming into contact with animal dander may cause an outbreak. upper respiratory infections or colds may also be triggers. stress may cause the condition to worsen. the condition is not contagious and can't be spread from person to person.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
doctors do not know the exact cause of eczema but a defect of the skin that impairs its function as a barrier possibly combined with an abnormal function of the immune system are believed to be important factors. studies have shown that in people with atopic dermatitis there are gene defects that lead to abnormalities in certain proteins (such as filaggrin) that are important in maintaining the barrier of normal skin. some forms of eczema can be triggered by substances that come in contact with the skin such as soaps cosmetics clothing detergents jewelry or sweat. environmental allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions) may also cause outbreaks of eczema. changes in temperature or humidity or even psychological stress can lead to outbreaks of eczema in some people.

what increases the risk of getting rh sensitization during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. during pregnancy an rh-negative woman can become sensitized if she is carrying an rh-positive fetus. factors that increase the risk of blood mixing and sensitization during pregnancy include: 2 delivery. abdominal trauma such as from a car accident. abdominal surgery such as a cesarean section. placenta abruptio or placenta previa both of which can cause placental bleeding. external cephalic version for a breech fetus. obstetric procedures such as amniocentesis fetal blood sampling or chorionic villus sampling (cvs). miscarriage (spontaneous abortion ) ectopic pregnancy or elective abortion (medical or surgical abortion) after 8 weeks of fetal age (when fetal blood cell production begins). partial molar pregnancy involving fetal growth beyond 8 weeks. although rare rh sensitization has been known to occur after needle sharing between intravenous drug users. transfusing rh-positive blood in an rh-negative person can also trigger sensitization. but this is extremely rare because blood is always tested prior to transfusion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

is malaria a particular problem for children?

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes. all children including young infants living in or traveling to malaria risk areas should take antimalarial drugs (for example chloroquine and mefloquine [lariam]). although the recommendations for most antimalarial drugs are the same as for adults it is crucial to use the correct dosage for the child. the dosage of drug depends on the age and weight of the child. a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases is recommended for consultation in prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment of children. since an overdose of an antimalarial drug can be fatal all antimalarial (and all other) drugs should be stored in childproof containers well out of the child's reach.

the life cycle of the malaria parasite ( plasmodium ) is complicated and involves two hosts humans and anopheles mosquitoes. the disease is transmitted to humans when an infected anopheles mosquito bites a person and injects the malaria parasites (sporozoites) into the blood. sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver mature and eventually infect the human red blood cells. while in red blood cells the parasites again develop until a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human and ingests human red blood cells containing the parasites. then the parasites reach the anopheles mosquito's stomach and eventually invade the mosquito salivary glands. when an anopheles mosquito bites a human these sporozoites complete and repeat the complex plasmodium life cycle. p. ovale and p. vivax can further complicate the cycle by producing dormant stages (hypnozoites) that may not develop for weeks to years.

how can accidental of acetaminophen overdose be avoided in adults?

Actual Doctor's Response:
to avoid unintentional overdoses among adults here are some suggestions. read the labels of the medication bottles carefully and determine the amount or strength of acetaminophen in each pill or spoonful. become familiar with all of the other medications that you are taking. remember that over 200 drugs contain acetaminophen as one of the ingredients and that certain drugs such as phenobarbital can significantly increase liver damage. before you take the medication write down (record) the maximum safe number of pills or spoonfuls that you can ingest over 24 hours. stick to that quantity and do not deviate. if however you are unsure of the safe number of doses or think that you need to take more than you should call your doctor or pharmacist. when you receive a prescription for a new medication ask your doctor or pharmacist whether it affects the body's metabolism (processing) of the other medications that you are taking including acetaminophen. if you have been drinking alcohol regularly do not exceed taking two grams of acetaminophen over 24 hours. be honest with yourself about the ingestion of alcohol. record the number of pills or spoonfuls of acetaminophen and the time that you take them.

both benadryl and suboxone can cause drowsiness. taking the two together can cause severe drowsiness. they also can both lead to constipation. taking two medications that have similar side effects usually intensifies the side effects. if you need an antihistamine while taking suboxone i suggest you talk to your pharmacist who can recommend on that does not cause drowsiness. suboxone is a controlled narcotic that is used in opioid dependency and addiction treatment and should not be combined with other substances because it can lead to dangerous side effects including respiratory distress loss of consciousness coma and death. you should tell your doctor about any other medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines) and any alcohol consumption as it may be possible to adjust the amount of suboxone to a safer level. the most common side effects associated with suboxone use vertigo and lethargy are intensified when the drug is combined with other medications and may also lead to an increase of the body’s tolerance and dependence to suboxone. this means that the body will require progressively increased amounts of suboxone. there has been a lot of controversy and debate concerning the use of suboxone with other substances. while most people understand that suboxone is used in opiate abuse and addiction treatment what they may not understand is that suboxone itself has the potential for dependency and has been the reason that many individuals on a suboxone regimen to have to undergo another detox. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility specializing in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility you may contact us at 855-338-6929.

(although they are happy to help many of them don’t have their own dads as role models. ) dads’ depression symptoms often go unnoticed. that’s because men don’t cry. depressed men may act angry withdrawn or even abusive. it’s important for friends family and health care providers to identify dads with postpartum depression and encourage them to seek help.

Patient Question:
how to get fluid behind the eardrum to drain. i have been to the doctors several times and on several antibiotics and i have no pain in my ear but i cant hear from the fluid built up. what can i do

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion (fluid). 1. you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent. 2. decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc. have all been used with limited success. sometimes it helps. sometimes it doesn't. antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of "plumbing and ventilation" issue. not an infection. 3. an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid (tympanostomy) or suction and place tubes in your ears. i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum. i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside-down. with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i couldn't hear much through that ear. after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube. now apparently that tube isn't there to drain liquid or it would have done so already; i bet it's just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors. whatever. it's the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it's connection to the nose. i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped. that's the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way. apparently i didn't do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it'd get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside (where the ocean was). then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction. i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube. after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear. fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear. i caution you though about the decision to have "tubes" put in the ear drum to drain this fluid. i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out. i actually had the little tiny plastic rings. they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic. most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not. i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem. i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on. many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts e-coli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water. you do not want this to fester in your ear. depending on the type of tube used scar tissue can be left behind and ear drum will not heal on it's own. so you need another surgery to attempt to have the ear drum heal. the first attempt and it is beyond me why they even do this one the surgeon roughs up the ear drum and then places a thin patch of some kind of material over the hole(s) and hope this will work. this is only 60% effective. but it's your only option. i don't like the odds but that's all i was offered. i did not sneeze nor blow my nose for two months. and i was diligent in this i did not want another surgery i wanted this to work. it did not work at all. so now if i want to pursue it i have to submit to another surgery more anesthesia. risk. and the surgeon doesn't like this one because it's "very tiny surgery" is what i was told. they have to stitch the hole closed and i would imagine it's a big pain in the you know where. so don't just jump into this surgery. especially if you are not having pain. i would try more medications give it some more time try decongestants or antihistamines to dry out the ear(s). another go with antibiotics which i know is a real pain in and of itself. but don't just jump into surgery especially if you want to be able to swim this summer. pools are a better choice because the water is chlorinated but chlorine can damage as well. you will need ear plugs to swim but that's not a 100% guarantee that water will not get into the ear. i was told to use cotton balls covered in vaseline petroleum jelly when bathing or when swimming. this is disgusting and it does not come out of your ear. so you walk around with vaseline in your ears. really think about it. when i was a little girl i had swimmers ear; water behind the ear. i went to the doctor and he told me to drop alcohol in my ear until i heard it 'fill up'. you do this by tilting you head to the opposite side that has the water and slowly drop alcohol in the ear until you hear it 'fill up'. then press a kleenex or clean cloth against that ear to restrict the exit flow of alcohol and slowly tilt your head toward the side that has the water and slowly release the alcohol from the ear. you will hear it chug chugging as it exits and the last bit of flow should feel warm; that is the trapped water. i have used this technique for years when swimming or anytime i think i have water behind my ear. it works beautifully. i have had this for a month and apart from a nasal steroid spray the doctor says it will go on it's own accord. i have tried holding my nose and blowing hard into your cheeks but you just have to keep trying. try drinking laying down as well. it's a miserable complaint.

Patient Question:
is counting calories really the trick to losing weight?

Actual Doctor's Response:
healthy weight management is all about energy balance. that means burning more calories than you're consuming. so it is helpful to become familiar with the calorie counts of the foods you eat most often. keep a food diary for a couple of days and then look up the calorie counts of the foods you've eaten. you can get that information by referring to the nutrition facts panel on packaged foods or by looking online at websites like the usda national nutrient database. this will give you a sense of where your calories are coming from and help you identify some smart and easy ways to cut calories. for instance if you normally drink whole milk you can switch to fat-free milk and save 60 calories per cup. after a while you'll become a good diet detective and be able to estimate the calorie counts of your most regularly eaten foods. also remember that the higher the fat content the higher the caloric level. and of course the larger your portion the more calories you're consuming.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9898
if you can keep it up counting calories is a pretty good way to lose weight. it can be tough for some people to stick to over time. however one of the things i like about counting calories is it makes you more aware of portion sizes. then even if you stop counting calories you have a better idea of what a "normal" portion size is. portion size is one of our biggest enemies today when it comes to weight control. a thousand calories a day may be a bit on the low side. generally we don't recommend people go below 1 200 calories per day because that may not give you the energy you need to get throughout the day. exercise is such an important part of any weight loss plan. and it could be tough getting through a normal day and exercising when you're consuming so few calories. you also run the risk of not getting enough of the daily vitamins and minerals you need. make sure you're eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and lean proteins (lean meat chicken low-fat dairy or beans) to get the nutrients you need each day.

my 2-yr-old son has a very red and swollen penis painful to touch. he peed without any complaints. what can this be? . he is not circumcised

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think you should get this looked at. whatever is causing the problem it's not normal. you may want to gently inspect the position of the foreskin. it should naturally cover the head of the penis (the glans). you should never pull the foreskin back on a boy younger than about age 5 not even to clean. at age 2 you can easily damage your son's penis by forcibly retracting (pulling back) the foreskin. at any rate a red swollen painful penis in a child is not something to take lightly. i'd suggest you put a call in to his pediatrician as soon as possible. best wishes to you both! your son has been jacking off to much tell him to stop or maybe he needs to have sex more you irresponsible parent.

Patient Question:
there have been problems in the past with insurance companies denying certain tests or procedures. . does the new health care law address or change these issues? will insurance companies still be able to block treatments they deem too costly or unnecessary?

Actual Doctor's Response:
insurance companies have to comply with new rules and cover some services they haven't had to in the past. but to have your services covered you do need to comply with the rules of your benefits package in order to get coverage. generally services must be deemed medically necessary in order to be covered.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9126
last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans — typically offered by employers — from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you haven’t been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a “pre-existing condition” – and insurers also won’t be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders.

what is polymerase chain reaction?

Actual Doctor's Response:
polymerase chain reaction is a method to analyze a short sequence of dna (or rna) even in samples containing only minute quantities of dna or rna. pcr is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of dna or rna. previously amplification of dna involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria and took weeks. but now with pcr done in test tubes it takes only a few hours. pcr is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the dna. moreover pcr uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying dna: two "primers" short single-stranded dna sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the dna stretch to be copied. an enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of dna reading its code and assembling a copy. a pile of dna building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy.

what is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd)?

Actual Doctor's Response:
an icd is a sophisticated device used primarily to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation two life-threatening heart rhythms. the icd constantly monitors the heart rhythm. when it detects a very fast abnormal heart rhythm it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. there are several ways the icd can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. they include: anti-tachycardia pacing (atp). when the heart beats too fast a series of small electrical impulses may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. cardioversion. a low energy shock may be delivered at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm. defibrillation. when the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly a higher energy shock may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal rhythm. anti-bradycardia pacing. many icds provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.

if you have heart failure: be sure any exercise is paced and balanced with rest. avoid isometric exercises such as push-ups and sit-ups. isometric exercises involve straining muscles against other muscles or an immovable object. don't exercise outdoors when it is too cold hot or humid. high humidity may cause you to tire more quickly; extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation make breathing difficult and cause chest pain. better choices are indoor activities such as mall walking. make sure you stay hydrated. it is important to drink water even before you feel thirsty especially on hot days. but be careful not to drink too much water. follow your doctor's guidelines about how much fluid you can have in a day. extremely hot and cold showers or sauna baths should be avoided after exercise. these extreme temperatures increase the workload on the heart. steer clear of exercise in hilly areas. if you must walk in steep areas make sure you slow down when going uphill to avoid working too hard. monitor your heart rate closely. if your exercise program has been interrupted for a few days (for example due to illness vacation or bad weather) make sure you ease back into the routine. start with a reduced level of activity and gradually increase it until you are back where you started.

Patient Question:
i had partial hysterectermy for prolapse uterus. i seem to be haveing same problem again. i am concerned and worried

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this issue especially during the holiday season! the problem here is that people use the term "partial hysterectomy " to mean different things. it can mean you had your uterus removed but not your cervix ovaries or other reproductive structures. the term "partial hysterectomy" also can be used to mean the uterus and cervix were removed but not the ovaries and fallopian tubes. because you had your uterus removed it is not possible for that organ to prolapse again. it is gone. i suppose it is possible for the cervix itself to prolapse (that is to hang down outside the vaginal opening) but this would be relatively uncommon. more common would be a possible prolapsed bladder. this can occur when the muscles that hold the urinary bladder in place become weak and the bladder collapses down into the vaginal wall. this certainly could feel the same as a prolapsed uterus and you may have symptoms such as pelvic pain difficulty urinating and tissue protruding from the vagina. i suggest you see your gynecologist or primary care provider to get this checked out. it's not a medical emergency but obviously you want to get an examination soon if only to make yourself feel better in finding out what the problem is. i wish you all the best.

pregnancy is always a tough one and the one thing i can tell you is that the recommendations are usually for lifestyle modification. pregnant women should modify their diet. i know it's hard because they want to have certain foods usually spicy but they need to cut down on these particular items. they need to really eliminate caffeine from their diet as well this will really help with the heartburn problem. if needed their ob/gyn may recommend a calcium tablet like a tums which they can chew during the day. but they want to be careful for the amount that they chew because there are calcium limits in pregnant women. antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate should not be taken by pregnant women because they can lead to fluid retention. some doctors recommend the prescription drug sucralfate for treating chronic heartburn during pregnancy. but remember women who are pregnant should talk to their doctor before using any over-the-counter or prescription drug. by talking to the pharmacist telling us your symptoms advising us that you are pregnant we will be more than happy to help you understand your options.

it is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. once you do get pregnant you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. before you start trying to get pregnant it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. sometimes medicines should be changed and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. each woman is different. so you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own. if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant: do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.

Patient Question:
what causes atopic dermatitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the cause of atopic dermatitis is poorly understood and is the subject of active research. research shows that it develops as a result of interaction between the environment your immune system and genetics (heredity). people with this condition seem to have very sensitive immune systems that are more prone to react to numerous irritants and allergens. most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergic conditions such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ). the skin inflammation that causes the atopic dermatitis rash is considered a type of allergic response. research has shown that even the unaffected skin of people with atopic dermatitis does not hold water as well as it should. 2 3 itching and rash can be triggered by a variety of factors including: exposure to allergens such as pollen animal dander or molds. dust mites may be an allergen although experts don't know whether they affect atopic dermatitis. exposure to irritants such as using soaps rubbing the skin and wearing wool. exposure to workplace irritants such as fumes and chemicals. climate factors especially winter weather and low humidity. cold air does not contain much moisture which can result in drier skin and increased itchiness. temperature changes. sudden changes in temperature can result in increased itchiness. a suddenly higher temperature may bring on sweating which can cause itching. lying under blankets entering a warm room or going from a warm shower into colder air can all promote itching. emotional stress. emotions such as frustration or embarrassment may lead to increased itchiness and scratching. exposure to certain foods typically eggs peanuts milk soy or wheat products. up to 40% of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis also have some type of food allergy. 4 but experts do not agree on whether foods can cause atopic dermatitis. excessive washing. repeated washing dries out the top layer of skin leading to drier skin and increased itchiness especially in the winter months when humidity is low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

the cause of atopic dermatitis is not known but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors. there seems to be a basic hypersensitivity and an increased tendency toward itching. evidence suggests that the disease is associated with other so-called atopic disorders such as hay fever (seasonal allergies) and asthma which many people with atopic dermatitis also have. in addition many children who outgrow the symptoms of atopic dermatitis go on to develop hay fever or asthma. although one disorder does not necessarily cause another they may be related thereby giving researchers clues to understanding atopic dermatitis. while emotional factors and stress may in some cases exacerbate or initiate the condition they do not seem to be a primary or underlying cause for the disorder.

Patient Question:
how do i make a persistent dry cough go away for good? . it's been about two weeks now since i've had a cold/flu and i can't afford to go to a doctor right now. how can i treat this at home? or will i need to go see a doctor for this?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer you are coughing for a reason. coughing helps clear your airway of mucous so if you are still coughing then perhaps you are still having post-nasal drainage. coughing can irritate the respiratory track so the more that you cough the more that you may feel the need to cough. assuming that you are not having signs of a secondary infection like pneumonia (fever chills rapid respiration) or an asthma-reaction (wheezing shortness of breath etc. ) you can quiet an annoying cold-related cough several ways: hydrate: drink plenty of fluids humidify: use a cool mist humidifer or at least take a steamy shower before bedtime soothe: try some honey to coat your throat suppress: you can take an over-the-counter cough suppressant that contains dextramethorophan (dm). a pharmacist can help you select a good one. try some cough drops. many contain soothing glycerine to help the irritated throat. don't leave them in your mouth at bedtime however! control post-nasal drainage. an antihistamine may help dry up a drip. avoid decongestants at bedtime (they increase post-nasal drainage) any persistent cough should be taken seriously so you may need to see a medical professional if the cough does not quiet down and completely resolve.

Patient Question:
to dr. moser i hope you read this. thank you for answering my question. some more information would be appreciated. it was a staph infection that was in his testicle area. i know the needle would've hurt. but should he have felt much more after that. it was a min or less that the dr. waited before he started to lance the infected area. it was a very small incision that he made. no bigger than the tip of a pen

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer a staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced. i have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as i am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved. just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use. many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them. in order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected in the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus. this can be very difficult. sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is less painful that trying to numb up this challenging area. hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now. if the staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again.

Actual Doctor's Response:
that will be up to his medical provider to decide. while there are blood tests (ebv panel and liver function tests) that can determine the current status of this pesky viral infection a hands-on examination may be necessary to know if he is now good-to-go. since some "daily activities" may include contact or collision sports (like football) it is best to get the patient-specific okay from his doctor or health care professional. the fact that he is feeling great is the best news of course so the mono may have completely resolved by this four week mark.

how can i tell if i’m sleep deprived?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you fall asleep before your head hits the pillow that’s not a good sign. that means you’re sleep deprived okay. if you fall asleep in less than 5 minutes on a regular basis you probably need more sleep. if you fall asleep while driving that’s a big danger zone factor a big red flag that you’re going to want to understand a little bit more about. driving a car and operating a vehicle and while it may seem very rote and may seem very easy to do if you notice yourself moving over lanes not being able to stay in the lane as you normally would that’s going to be a definite sign of sleep deprivation. if you’re not thinking as clearly you’re not making the decisions that you would normally make as quickly that’s going to be a sign of sleep deprivation. and just overall movement your reaction time slows down with sleep deprivation your cognition time slows down. believe it or not even your creativity slows down with sleep deprivation. so if you’re at work and you’re trying to answer to a big problem or trying to understand what’s going on and you’re just not clicking you’re not finding the words you’re not doing the right thing or what you would normally do it could be a sign of sleep deprivation.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this? my friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds. i was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight. the first thing i did was not allow her to make her own plate. she thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate. a sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein (1 sausage) and a glass of orange juice. or since you're young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal that's healthy and without all that sugar. an ex could be kashi or something like raisin bran. the second thing i did was teach her about nutrition. her mom is 300+ pounds so i knew there was no one there who knew either. if you ball your hand into a fist that's the size of your stomach. that's how much food can actually fit. anymore than that then you're stretching your stomach out. the more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size it's supposed to be. third which should probably be first but i wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise. you have to exercise. skipping at school or pe isn't enough. i walked with her everyday for 30 minutes. she didn't think she could do it but i stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her. we were even able to start doing it twice a day. hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging. fourth you have to drink tons of water. sometimes your body might feel like it's hungry when you're actually thirsty. a good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day. to help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cups/glasses and that's how you can keep track. fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods. i made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal. her snacks were fruit. also a good time to say eat 5-7 small meals everyday and when i say small i mean the size of your fist small.

Patient Question:
why does coffee give me such an energy boost?

Actual Doctor's Response:
as you're drinking your morning cup of joe you're probably just waiting for that wonderful rush of energy and alertness you've come to know and enjoy. within 15 minutes of gulping your caffeine your adrenalin rises increasing your heart and breathing rates your stomach starts to produce more acids and your urinary output rises (as anyone with a small bladder knows! ). but i bet you didn't know that caffeine tweeks your adrenal glands to produce more cortisol (stress hormone) which then stimulates the release of the liver's stored sugars. any endurance athlete knows this and uses it to their advantage. you drink your caffeine and then use the newly circulating sugar fuel to power through another workout. but what if you're sitting at your desk sipping your coffee with nowhere to go? then you might have problems because when the sugar levels rise with caffeine so do insulin levels which when they finally plummet after handling the circulating sugar leave a rip roaring appetite for more sugar in their wake. for runners and bikers this makes sense since you've just burned a zillion calories and need to replenish the sugar stores. not so for someone in an office cubicle with nowhere to go. here are some suggestions. to kill carb cravings associated with caffeine ingestion make certain to eat a combo of protein and fiber. how about peanut or almond butter on a multigrain cracker? or have that caffeine with a yogurt and blueberries or eggs and veggies. you get the point. when you're downing lots of coffee with nothing in your stomach you're more likely to reach for sugary foods so watch out. or you can just drink beverages with less caffeine in them: 6 ounces brewed coffee 105 mg caffeine; 6 ounces instant coffee 55 mg; 12 ounces colas 35-45 mg; 6 ounces tea 35 mg. now remember when you go to one of your fancy schmancy coffee houses you'll often be purchasing at least 8 ounces of coffee and closer to 12 ounces so you're really consuming over 200 mg of caffeine. all the more reason to be cautious if you just happen to be one of those people who is affected by the sugar rush.

research shows that regular exercise reduces symptoms of moderate depression and enhances psychological fitness. exercise can even produce changes in certain chemical levels in the body which can have an effect on the psychological state. endorphins are hormones in the brain associated with a happy positive feeling. a low level of endorphins is associated with depression. during exercise plasma levels of this substance increase. this may help to ease symptoms of depression. a national health and nutrition survey found that physically active people were half as likely to be depressed. exercise also boosts the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. neurotransmitters are chemicals that send specific messages from one brain cell to another. though only a small percentage of all serotonin is located in the brain this neurotransmitter is thought to play a key role in keeping your mood calm.

Patient Question:
what's the difference between "situational depression" and depression that's not situational?

Actual Doctor's Response:
depression is depression defined by a series of symptoms that involve changes in sleep energy concentration appetite etc. one does not need to have a reason to develop a depression though if there is a particular event that may have precipitated it (e. g. a loss a separation) that may be relevant to the psychotherapy and understanding one's vulnerabilities to depression. not everybody who has a loss or stressful event occur develops a depression so the thinking is that someone either is or isn't biologically vulnerable to developing depression. depression is different from normal grief or sadness. grief or sadness related to an event does not involve disruptions of sleep and appetite or thoughts of suicide. in fact normal grief can become complicated by a depression which in turn can interfere with the resolution of the grief; so in other words depression is a syndrome involving many components and whatever causes it (we don't really know) it should get treated. when the syndrome involves strong physical symptoms (sleep energy concentration not functioning thoughts of suicide) medicines are especially likely to be helpful.

Actual Doctor's Response:
employers have plenty of incentive to offer health insurance. for one it's a very important tool for attracting top-notch employees a fact the law isn't likely to change. second employers reap significant tax benefits by offering employees health insurance. in addition the health reform law requires employers to continue offering coverage or pay fines for failing to do so. and any changes employers make to their plans will have more to do with controlling costs than anything else -- a trend that's been in place long before the affordable care act became law.

although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. a moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men (under 65 years old) and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old. a serving is considered: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits so the answer to your question depends on if you’re male or female how old you are and whether you’re having an appropriate serving size. if you’re already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isn’t to suggest that you start drinking if you don’t already. the potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too. this would be an area to discuss further with your doctor. drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems. keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension. it’s typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you don’t already and it’s important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol.

why [not] flumist? it is an equally effective (some studies say "more effective") flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose. no needles. when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things: 1. i give them choices. they can have one shot (assuming they only need one) or two! 2. i can give them a "booster" instead of a shot. (it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful! ) 3. they can get it in their arm or leg where it doesn't hurt very much or their eye! (of course we don't do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice. 4. i tell them this: "i am not supposed to do this but if you don't tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle. the one we use for infants instead of the big-person needle. how about that? " 5. and finally. "if this little "booster" hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately! " (of course she is going to do that anyway. ) the games we play.

"convince" a reluctant "child" to get a flu shot? who is the adult and who is the child. there's no convincing a child. i've seen bribery done. if it was my situation the child would have learned right from the beginning that sometimes we must do things that aren't the most pleasant but will be over soon. never lie to a child and say it won't hurt. there was one thing i taught and allowed my children to do for a shot: either alone or accompanied by me to sing as loud as possible happy birthday. it always worked and they always wanted me to sing along loud. of course the dr. was warned first.

what's best of day to check your blood pressure. my pressure changes all the time when i check it at different times. i'm 74 and a active person. thomas

Actual Doctor's Response:
keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day. exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards. stress can influence blood pressure too. in fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldn’t be elevated otherwise. make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible. for these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people. also because your blood pressure can vary it’s important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern. the best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel. the accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device. some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too. to determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device. it is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day. the most important reading would then be the average reading so just take your bp a few times a day and write it down. as long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important. my moms blood pressure is 56 over 40 what

how is having a $3000 health care deductible better? . since the aca i now have a $3000 deductible for medical care and $1500 deductible for prescriptions. in effect i pay $200 a month for insurance that does not pay for anything. i will not meet those deductibles within 12 months unless something catastrophic happens (and i cant afford that). i fail to see how this is improving health care in america. all it has done is ensure people go to the doctor less frequently even if they need care and and that they don't get the medications they need.

Actual Doctor's Response:
many people have expressed frustration as you have about the cost of health insurance -- in particular the out-of-pocket costs that come with many health plans. insurers are now required to accept everyone who applies (before the law they frequently refused to sell coverage to people with any type of pre-existing medical condition). in response they have looked for other ways to reduce costs. shifting costs of care to consumers is one way to do that. the plans do provide access to many preventive services without you having to pay anything at the time of the visit. so it's important to take advantage of that -- wellness visits vaccinations many cancer screenings etc. depending on your health condition you may able to get most of the care you need each year at no additional cost. and you mentioned a catastrophic situation which is what insurance is intended to protect against in the first place. under the law your costs are capped at $6 600 for 2015. that's a lot of money but if you were in an accident or got very sick it's a lot lower than it would be if you had no coverage or even a private insurance policy before the law took effect. still i understand your frustration. no doubt there are trade offs. everyone is now guaranteed coverage but healthcare remains very pricey for most people. you might want to revisit the marketplace during open enrollment -- november 15 - february 15 -- to see if you can find yourself a better deal.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the affordable care act does allow insurers to charge smokers a 50% surcharge because of their tobacco use. that can amount to a large increase -- potentially thousands of dollars -- in the cost of health insurance for smokers. and the tax credits available to help lower the cost of insurance premiums cannot be applied to offset the smoking penalty. however insurers do have flexibility in how this surcharge is applied and some states have banned the practice meaning insurers selling in vermont and washington dc for example won't be allowed to charge smokers more for their insurance plan (you can check with your state's department of insurance to learn the law where you live). in addition the law does require insurers to cover treatments that help smokers quit. most employers make smoking cessation programs available as well. and under the law's regulations insurers will not be allowed to charge you the full surcharge if you enroll in a smoking cessation program.

Patient Question:
what surgery options do i have for parkinsons disease?

Actual Doctor's Response:
brain surgery may be considered when drugs fails to control symptoms of parkinson's disease or cause severe or disabling side effects. deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) is a technique for treating parkinson's disease. it affects movement by using electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. the electrical impulses are generated by wire electrodes surgically placed in the brain. deep brain stimulation may be used in addition to therapy with levodopa or other drugs when drugs alone do not control symptoms adequately. this technique is the preferred surgical method of treating most cases of advanced parkinson's disease. it does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than older more destructive surgical methods such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy. 6 deep brain stimulation (dbs) neither cures parkinson's disease nor eliminates the need for medicine. dbs of the thalamus is done to treat disabling tremor caused by parkinson's disease. procedures that stimulate the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus control a wider range of symptoms (in addition to tremor) and are used more often than stimulation of the thalamus. pallidotomy and thalamotomy are rarely done anymore. they involve the precise destruction of very small areas in the deep part of the brain that cause symptoms. neurotransplantation surgery is an experimental procedure being studied for the treatment of parkinson's disease. it involves implanting cells that produce dopamine into the brain. information about the effectiveness of neurotransplantation is limited and it is not a proven treatment or a realistic option for most people at this time. surgery choices deep brain stimulation pallidotomy thalamotomy neurotransplantation what to think about a neurologist with special training in parkinson's disease is most often the best kind of doctor to make a decision about surgery. if you might benefit from surgery or deep brain stimulation your neurologist can refer you to a brain surgeon with experience doing these operations. surgery most often becomes a treatment option for people when parkinson's disease progresses to the point that drugs can no longer control symptoms adequately. with advanced disease existing symptoms may get worse or a person may develop new symptoms that drugs cannot control. (however when a person has severe one-sided tremor deep brain stimulation [dbs] may be considered much sooner because this symptom often responds better to dbs than to medicine. ) people who have extremely advanced parkinson's or who have other serious conditions (such as heart or lung disease cancer or kidney failure ) are not usually good candidates for surgery. surgery is usually not considered for people who have dementia or psychiatric disorders. surgery is not a cure for parkinson's disease. drugs are usually still necessary after surgery but surgery can reduce the number and amount of drugs needed to control symptoms. this reduces the side effects caused by drugs while at the same time controlling symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

does ibuprofen pmr interact with any other medications?

Actual Doctor's Response:
drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel "blood thinners" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval.

emphysema and chronic bronchitis are chronic (long-term) lung diseases that make it hard to breathe. both diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd) meaning they are conditions that cause a limitation in airflow. emphysema and chronic bronchitis can occur separately or together and are usually the result of cigarette smoking. in addition although it happens rarely a genetic form of emphysema can occur early in adulthood even if you never smoked. in the united states copd is vastly underdiagnosed. while only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with copd experts believe the majority of smokers develop some degree of airflow obstruction. emphysema comes on gradually after years of exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke. with emphysema the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged. because the tiny sacs lose their "stretch " less air gets in and out of the lungs. this causes you to feel short of breath. with chronic bronchitis the airways that carry air to the lungs are inflamed and produce a lot of mucus. the mucus and inflammation cause the airways to narrow or become obstructed making it difficult to breathe. once the airways are irritated over a long period the lining of the airways becomes thickened. this thickening of the airways results in an irritating cough hampered airflow and lung scarring. the damaged airways then become a breeding place for bacterial infections such as pneumonia.

Patient Question:
can i break the same bone twice. i broke my 3rd metacarpal 10 months ago. this past weekend while doing some work outside my hand started hurting. there was no trauma that i can remember. it has swelled up and is pretty painful. antiinflamitories dont seem to be helping. is it possible i broke it again?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it would typically require a significant injury again to fracture your metacarpal but the only way you will know for sure it to be examined by your medical provider and perhaps have another x-ray. bones tend to heal well if the fractures were properly lined up but bones can re-break.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have had both infections and only had itching with the yeast infection. any discharge? uti's or bladder infections feel more of an urgency to urinate and then you go and its just a few dribbles that causes discomfort. however maybe its in the hair lice etc. it will live in all hair and on surfaces. i'd have this checked out again and if your doctor still says everything is fine ask what you can do to alleviate the symptoms. good luck that feeling is awful as most women know at one time or another!

alternative medicine also called integrative or complementary medicine features the use of non-traditional (in the western world) techniques for treatment. for example self-relaxation approaches to the therapy of hypertension include yoga biofeedback and meditation. these techniques can be effective in lowering the blood pressure at least temporarily. in order to produce sustained reductions in the blood pressure these techniques may require hours of diligent adherence daily. they are generally practical only for a few highly motivated individuals with hypertension. acupuncture has not yet been established as a standard or proven therapy for hypertension in the western world. certain herbal remedies have blood pressure-lowering components that may well be effective in treating hypertension. most herbal remedies are available as food supplements and the food and drug administration (fda) does not approve them as drugs. therefore herbal treatments for hypertension have not yet been adequately evaluated in scientifically controlled clinical trials for effectiveness and safety. in particular their long-term side effects are unknown. a major problem with most herbal treatments is that their contents are not standardized. the ways in which herbal treatments work to lower blood pressure are not known and currently herbal remedies are usually not recommended for the treatment of hypertension.

hi found this really good answer from yahoo. com its about 7 years old but covers your problem very will. there are times that we cannot visualize the ovaries with either transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound. i am unsure if any of these fit your situation and i mean no disrespect but here it goes. gas in the intestines can make it difficult to see the ovaries. everyone has gas or air in their intestines and the intestines are situated in the same area as the ovaries. air effectively blocks the ultrasound beam so nothing behind that air can be seen. an obese patient is harder to scan because when the ultrasound beam has to penetrate a lot of tissue it has weakened by the time it gets deep enough to see the organs. post menopausal ovaries can be hard to find with ultrasound. young ovaries are like grapes. fat and juicy. older ovaries are more like raisins. smaller and dried up! those young juicy ovaries are easier to see. if the uterus is large (due to past pregnancies or fibroids for example) the ovaries are pushed further towards your sides instead of nearer the midline of your body. if the ovaries are situated further out they are harder to see. with transabdominal ultrasound we use the bladder to help us see the ovaries. if the ovaries are not somewhat near the bladder we might not see them. with transvaginal ultrasound the ovaries need to be somewhat near the cervix. the transvaginal transducer (or camera) cannot see things unless they are within a certain distance from the cervix. it has a limited distance of penetration. the good news is that if you had ovarian cysts or a large mass on the ovaries they would be hard to miss. when we cannot see the ovaries we can be relatively sure that they are small and grossly normal. your doctor might ask you to do another ultrasound at some other point. in any event this is not an abnormal situation and it does happen to patients from time to time. source: i am an ultrasound technologist. do hope this helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
is tylenol safe to use for “flu” symptoms caused by interferon for hepatitis c treatment? is motrin safer?

Actual Doctor's Response:
tylenol (acetaminophen) is toxic to the liver in large doses (such as in suicidal attempts where a patient ingests large amounts often more than 10 grams of the medication) and also in situations where a patient drinks alcohol heavily while taking high doses of tylenol. tylenol with alcohol ingestion can be toxic to the liver with lower doses of tylenol than without the alcohol. otherwise for the general population both tylenol and motrin (ibuprofen an nsaids) have low (1%) liver toxicity at the regular recommended doses. moreover both drugs can usually be used in the recommended doses prescribed by a physician reasonably safely for the "flu" symptoms caused by interferon used for treating chronic hepatitis c. with advanced complicated cirrhosis from hepatitis c for which interferon is rarely used all drugs including these must be prescribed with great caution if at all. in addition in these patients with advanced cirrhosis nsaids including motrin can worsen or even precipitate hepatorenal syndrome (a serious condition with both liver and kidney failure) and possibly cause intestinal bleeding.

since i had brain surgery before is it bad for my health if my boyfriend pulls my hair roughly? . it's been 12 years since i had brain surgery as a child. all i remember is that until my hair grew back i had a scar on the back of head where they had removed a piece of my skull during the surgery. now my boyfriend grabbed all of my hair and pulled it while kissing me which i loved. but afterwards i noticed something didn't feel right in that area in the back of my head for the next couple of days. is it possible that my previous brain surgery makes hair pulling actually unhealthy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your scalp is really not connected to your brain but your scalp is rich in sensory nerves so forceful hair-pulling may result in some residual discomfort as you have experienced. brain surgery 12 years ago should not preclude playful hair-pulling but if this act causes you pain afterwards it should be avoided no matter how much you loved it.

vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue. an accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesn't directly point to either condition. an endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex. your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause. however other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn. i would talk to my gynecologist if it's that much blood. at first i was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if it's a showstopper then that's another story. then did some looking around and fibroids or polyps could be the culprit and they don't affect a pap smear. i had a polyp once and went through a d&c and never had issues again. with fibroids i hear they can come back. i also read that some of this might be hormonal and since you have had a hysterectomy this might make sense. bottom line i'd go see your gyno. hope this helps.

Actual Doctor's Response:
regarding the question about drug costs in actuality 80% of prescription drugs sold in this country are generic -- and prices of drugs haven't risen greatly in the past few years. what has increased however is the portion many of us have to pay toward the cost of our drugs which is likely what you're experiencing. that's not a function of obamacare but rather a funtion of employers (assuming you get insurance at work) and insurers shifting more costs onto consumers as a way of getting control over their own costs. unfortunately that's a trend that's likely to continue.

Actual Doctor's Response:
long-term smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). if the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of copd. i'd suggest your husband see a doctor about this. the coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking. he will only find out by having a physical exam. keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs. smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body. quitting smoking is always the best option but i realize it can very difficult for some people to do. and some people simply don't want to quit smoking. i hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing. i wish you all the best!

how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically "osteoarthritis" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the "wear and tear" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define "arthritis" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed. i am type 2 diabetic so that could have something to do with it. get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life.

Patient Question:
i have a cut on the corner of my mouth that wont heal. what can i use to help?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you're referring to a crack in the corner of your mouth where the upper and lower lips join you may be suffering from perleche known medically as angular cheilitis. perleche can be caused by a fungal infection in which case you'll need to see a doctor for medication to help it heal. the condition also can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin b so you can try taking a vitamin supplement (assuming you're not allergic to any medications or food colorings) or eating more green leafy vegetables which typically contain plenty of different b vitamins. because of the possibility this is a fungal infection i'd suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider for an evaluation. i wish you all the best!

this all depends on how much of your hand was burned – if it is a large area you will want to be seen by a health care provider as soon as possible. do not puncture the blisters and do not put anything on the burn like butter mayonnaise or ice. even if it is a small area you will want to watch it for signs of infection which includes redness swelling continued pain and possible oozing or a "wet" appearance.

Patient Question:
is there another medication besides prednisone that will take down inflammation caused by a severe case of vasculitis. doctors have recently diagnosed this condition in my mother's lower stomach area. prednisone treatment (40mg) after 16 days has done nothing to ease the severe pain or nausea especially after eating. actually the symptoms are getting worse and it seems she is giving up after a 1 year fight with this. is there another medication she can be put on to take away the inflammation so she can have a stint put in? please help me as i believe time is running out.

Actual Doctor's Response:

you may be worried about nothing. please relax and be like your mother. the vast majority of skin lesions are not cancer and those that are may be very easy to treat from removing the lesion in the office to topical creams. if every skin cancer was the dreaded malignant melanoma we would all be in trouble. since i can't see or examine your mother i cannot tell you "what it is" or "how it will be treated". you must first know what the "it" is. there is absolutely no way to predict an outcome of the biopsy or even discuss treatment. to make a wild jump to worrying that a scalp lesion be fatal is going overboard.

Patient Question:
had a period in april spotted may no period june and nothing for july yet. took a hpt 2wks ago negative. pregnant? . had sex recently gained weight during this time and very bad stomach ache 1 day for the last two months. had cramping with no period

Actual Doctor's Response:
a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell.

while there isn't one diet for reflux there are some general diet recommendations. first you want to avoid caffeine found in beverages like coffee and tea and foods like chocolate. alcohol often makes reflux worse so keep intake minimal. you'll also want to note which foods make your symptoms worse. common triggers include fatty foods spicy foods citrus fruits and products made with tomatoes. some people can eat small amounts of certain items without an issue. keep a food journal to be sure. for other lifestyle changes you can make see this webmd article.

is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.

Actual Doctor's Response:
no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.

Actual Doctor's Response:
bronchitis is not contagious (you cannot transmit bronchitis to someone else) but the pathogens (viruses bacteria fungus) etc. that are capable of causing bronchitis can be transmitted to others but exposure to these pathogens does not mean that the exposed person will contract bronchitis. they may only get a simple cold. or nothing at all. you are on an antibiotic that may or may not help bronchitis since it is just a clinical guess that the cause is bacterial.

should i have a follow up on my foot? . i walked into my childs toy last friday. i hit it on the left middle of my foot. it instantly swelled up. i went to the er later that night. they took x-rays said there was not anything wrong. well now 5 days later all of my toes are bruised and above my toes. if i hit the side of my foot it hurts and if i walk on it too much it hurts. its still hard to bend my toes and i really don't understand what my toes have to do with that part of my foot. should i go back to the doctor?

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes. go back to your doctor to have your foot checked. he or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong. your foot has 26 bones. there are 5 long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot. each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes. tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones. any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons. bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes. possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first x-ray. this is not unusual. your doctor will decide whether further x-rays or other testing is needed.

Actual Doctor's Response:
some people who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer do not have any symptoms. sometimes it is discovered before symptoms appear either on a chest x-ray or as part of lab tests. you may be seeing a doctor regularly to check for symptoms but symptoms might start between visits. be aware of what is normal for you and tell your doctor about any changes right away. be sure to let your doctor know if you feel even very small changes. what symptoms you may have will depend on which part of your body is affected by the cancer. call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: a change in bowel habits such as bleeding from your rectum bright red or dark blood in your stools frequent diarrhea constipation a feeling that your bowel is not emptying completely or stools that are narrow (may be no wider than a pencil) pain in your belly bloating or loss of appetite unexplained weight loss constant fatigue cough difficulty breathing or shortness of breath bone pain watchful waiting watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without giving treatment to cure your cancer. watchful waiting may be an option if treatment may cause more harm than good and is unlikely to cure your cancer. remember though that watchful waiting does not mean your doctor won't treat your symptoms such as pain. who to see if you have been treated for colorectal cancer doctors who can evaluate any new symptoms include: gastroenterologist. internist. family medicine doctor. colon and rectal surgeon. medical oncologist. radiation oncologist. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.

tramadol (ultram) is an fda pregnancy category c drug which means that animal reproduction studies have shown risks to a developing fetus but there no adequate studies done in humans to determine risk to a developing baby. in animal studies tramadol was toxic to the fetuses of pregnant mice rats and rabbits when given at very high doses to the mothers. the doses given were 2 to 15 times the human dose (on a pound-for-pound basis). at these doses tramadol was toxic to the mothers and the fetuses had low birth weights bone problems and developmental delays after being born. for these reasons doctors recommend tramadol not be given during pregnancy unless the risks to the mother (from uncontrolled pain) clearly outweigh the risks to the developing baby.

basically anytime that you have unprotected sex (the condom broke) you are capaple of getting pregnant however there are only a few days every month that you are ovulating. two days before your period is not the time you would be expected to ovulate so if you have a predictable regular cycle you are not likely going to get pregnant from this one isolated mistake. however if there were other mistakes in the last month or so then anything is possible. wait another week or so and take another home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for a more accurate pregnancy test and exam.

if you suddenly lose a large volume of blood you may be treated with fluids a blood transfusion oxygen and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells. chronic blood loss is treated by identifying the source of bleeding stopping the bleeding and if necessary giving treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. the most common cause of iron deficiency through blood loss is heavy menstrual bleeding in young women. non-menstruating women or men who develop iron deficiency need to have a colon exam (colonoscopy or barium enema) to help identify the source of chronic bleeding.

how much weight should i gain during pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
pregnancy doesn't equal a get-out-of-jail-free card for a caloric spending spree. if you gain too much weight you're at risk for conditions like gestational diabetes; too little and your baby may be born at a low birth weight. what's "just right" for you? if you're at a normal weight before pregnancy gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. if you are overweight before pregnancy gain 15 to 25 pounds. if you are underweight prior to pregnancy gain 28 to 40 pounds. for multiple births consult your doctor (usually you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds for twins). the average woman should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during her first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of her pregnancy.

gaining the right amount of weight during pregnancy by eating a healthy balanced diet is a good sign that your baby is getting all the nutrients he or she needs and is growing at a healthy rate. it is not necessary to "eat for two" during pregnancy. it's true that you need extra calories from nutrient-rich foods to help your baby grow but you generally need to consume only 100 to 300 more calories than you did before you became pregnant to meet the needs of your growing baby. ask your health care provider how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. a woman of average weight before pregnancy should gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. underweight women should gain 28 to 40 pounds during pregnancy. overweight women may need to gain only 15 to 25 pounds during pregnancy. you may need to gain more or less weight depending on what your health care provider recommends. in general you should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during your first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of your pregnancy. if you are expecting twins you should gain 35 to 45 pounds during your pregnancy. this would be an average of 1 ½ pounds per week after the usual weight gain in the first three months.

constant eye drainage should always be checked. if you have possibly damaged your cornea it could be leaking out slowly. it is very important to have it checked by your eye doctor. in some cases it is just allergies to something in the air. it can also be a problem with the tear ducts. but if it contiues with no let up do see a doctor.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the only way to know for sure you're pregnant is with a pregnancy test. but there are early symptoms of pregnancy that can alert you to the fact that you may be pregnant and should have a test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. some women are so attuned to their body and the changes it undergoes with pregnancy that they seem to know from the start they are pregnant. other women though have no suspicion they are pregnant until they miss their first period which is perhaps the most widely recognized early sign of pregnancy.

the most commonly used fillers are made out of hyaluronic acid. because of their varying consistency they are used differently. prevelle silk is the thinnest of the hyaluronic acid fillers. it gives a soft subtle effect that is very natural. it’s my personal favorite for treating the area around the lips. the effects usually last 3 to 4months. juvederm is slightly thicker. it works well on marionette lines that just beginning to show smile lines and to smooth the contours of jaws that are beginning to sag. juvederm usually lasts around 6-8 months although in the lips it does not last as long because the constant movement of the mouth breaks down the filler. restylane is one of the older fillers around. while many doctors still use it i personally prefer to use juvederm or perlane because i find they give smoother results. perlane is the thickest of the hyaluronic acid fillers. it’s best for deep folds like really pronounced marionette lines or the creases that run down from the nose and around the mouth. this is the one people start asking for once they hit forty. it lasts for about a year. perlane does tend to leave the skin slightly swollen for a couple of days so plan accordingly ifyou have a big event coming up. radiesse is a totally different filler. in the first place it’s made out of calcium. it has a firmer consistency which makes it ideal to model cheekbones or jawlines or to fill in very deep marionette lines. the problem some doctors have with radiesse is that because it takes so long to dissolve – up to a year in most cases – it’s very hard to correct mistakes. unsatisfactory radiesse results however are there to stay for the next 12 months.

there is no crystal clear roadmap for women who are bipolar and pregnant. that's because few studies have been done on bipolar disorder and pregnancy. not enough is known about the risks of untreated bipolar disorder or the risks and benefits of medications. and the factors that lead to relapse during pregnancy are not entirely clear. the symptoms of bipolar disorder however can worsen during pregnancy. pregnant women or new mothers with bipolar disorder have seven times the risk of hospital admissions compared with pregnant women who do not have bipolar disorder. a 2007 study on bipolar and pregnancy has shed further light. and it has called into question a common belief that pregnancy may have a protective effect for women with bipolar disorder. the study followed 89 women through pregnancy and one year after delivery. when stopping bipolar medications six months before conception to 12 weeks after women had: twice the risk of relapse. a 50% risk of recurrence within just two weeks if they stopped suddenly. (women who had unplanned pregnancies were more likely to stop at once. ) bipolar symptoms throughout 40% of the pregnancy -- or more than four times that experienced by women who continued their bipolar medications.

Patient Question:
does aspirin help prevent heart attacks and strokes?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i want to. talk about the use of aspirin for prevention of heart attacks strokes and other blood clotting problems. aspirin is commonly used for minor aches and pains and to reduce fever. aspirin also combats the effects of platelets blood cells that help blood clot. this helps reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes. indeed platelets are essential to human life because an excessively low count would cause bleeding. but platelets can also be involved in too much clot formation. when this occurs it can block a blood vessel and can lead to many potentially life-threatening problems including heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). it’s important to achieve a balance between too much clotting and not enough clotting. there is much confusion regarding the use of aspirin in prevention of heart attack and stroke. the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke — called primary prevention — is widely debated. there have been approximately seven clinical trials testing the effects of aspirin in someone with no prior history of heart attack or stroke. the doses have varied from 50 mg to 500 mg. while not all the trials showed benefit only one trial showed an increased risk of bleeding but those were patients on high dose aspirin. based on this ambiguous data the current american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention only in men with diabetes and intermediate cardiovascular risk and without an increased risk of bleeding. those patients who have a 10% risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period are defined as intermediate risk. the european society of cardiology guidelines do not recommend aspirin in primary prevention. in patients with previous stroke heart attack or certain other blood clotting problems aspirin has beneficial effects. for these people the american college of cardiology/american heart association guideline recommends starting aspirin 75 mg to 162 mg and continuing indefinitely in all patients unless other medical problems prevent its use. the benefits of aspirin need to outweigh the risk. yes it sure does. seven months ago my pulse went from around 55 to 65 count to over 200 beats. my blood pressure was steady at the 120 over 60. i was on a 325 coated aspirin since my by pass in 1999. i was on vacation at the time and when i seen my family doctor three weeks after it started he told me i had af and thanks god i was talking a 325 aspirin. my heart doctor agreed and now i am on pradax blood thinner. i have fluid in the lungs from the leaking blood and on a 40mg water pill. thank you toe fanjoy my hands and legs have been tingling and my right side has a pain can not move or cough it hurts

yes aleve and different nsaids (aspirin ibuprofen and remedy just meds like toradol furthermore the late claims against vioxx) can result in heart palpitations and you are taking a higher measurements than is prescribed (the pill supplement says don't take more than 2 in 24 hours). on the off chance that torment has been a real issue for you i'd go to a specialist and let him know/her that you have terrible symptoms from aleve and request help with whatever is bringing about you the agony. there are much more secure torment relievers out there than nsaids (even opiates are more secure when taken as recommended). nsaids have the danger of bringing on stomach ulcers and heart issues. anyway i'd enlighten your doc reality regarding your twofold dosing and take after their recommendation (accepting the doc is able which is frequently not protected to expect).

Patient Question:
how common is depression during and after pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
depression that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after delivery is called perinatal depression. the exact number of women with depression during this time is unknown. but researchers believe that depression is one of the most common complications during and after pregnancy. often the depression is not recognized or treated because some normal pregnancy changes cause similar symptoms and are happening at the same time. tiredness problems sleeping stronger emotional reactions and changes in body weight may occur during pregnancy and after pregnancy. but these symptoms may also be signs of depression.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the main way we first determine how far along a woman is in her pregnancy is by her period. further along in the pregnancy we can use other indicators including ultrasound. at this point there really is no way for you to know so you should go ahead and make an appointment with your doctor to touch base. they may want to do an ultrasound to get an idea of how far along you are.

depending on what kind of test you used some are very sensitive to the hormone that they measure to determine whether or not you're pregnant and can therefore give a positive reading earlier. some can show a positive result at 2 weeks. home tests can also give false-negatives. one common reason is that you're using or reading them incorrectly. even if you think that can't possibly be the case make sure you read and carefully follow the directions exactly. if you've had that many positive tests you could very likely be pregnant. you should schedule an appointment with your doctor who will probably do another urine tests and a blood test to be sure.

Patient Question:
can losing sleep now affect the rest of my life?

Actual Doctor's Response:
anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimer’s knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and it’s often anyone’s guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (let’s call it rbd for short). the facts: * with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to “act out” your dreams. translation: you’re not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep. * these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: you’re not getting the restful sleep you need. * rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson’s disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. it’s not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinson’s as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinson’s disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? we’ve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia — eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise — both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good night’s sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking: * one in three people over 65 will die with dementia. * twenty percent of us don’t get enough sleep — banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average. * heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly “harmless” struggle to get a good night’s sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep.

innocent by sleep-deprived insanity. that’s what one man is saying in one of the strangest trials of the year (maybe even the decade). when i read about it i dug a little deeper only to find that the details of the trial were even more complicated than the claim of innocence. here are the facts of the case (pretend you’re in the jury box): * woody smith of dayton kentucky strangled his wife to death in may of last year. * police records indicate that smith learned about his wife’s extra-martial affair and confronted her just before attacking her. * he was then hospitalized for an overdose of prescription pills. * his defense attorneys claim the violence occurred due to insanity brought on by lack of sleep as smith was allegedly having trouble sleeping because he was worried that his wife would leave him. * according to his lawyers smith was taking caffeine pills and drinking energy drinks to get him through the day. from my standpoint there are two questions to address here: * can you really become psychotic or delusional from sleep deprivation? * how can caffeine or energy drinks play into one’s propensity to kill another human being? first sleep deprivation itself can indeed impair someone’s judgment and ability to think clearly but that doesn’t necessarily lead to committing a murder. second it doesn’t surprise me to learn that perpetrators of crimes have laid blame on lots of things to justify claims of insanity. and when used in an overdosage situation caffeine can produce paranoid delusional behavior. while i do not know all of the specifics of this case i would find it hard to believe that the “red bull” made him do it. and you might recall me blogging about the story of kenneth parks who killed his mother-in-law while he was sleepwalking. he was found not guilty but then again… it’s not the same as killing someone while wide awake. though for someone like mr. smith he’s facing the possibility of a life sentence that no amount of restful sleep can take away. we’ll have to see what happens here.

when you think of sweet potatoes i hope the first thing that comes to mind is not the thanksgiving version that is steeped in sugar and topped with marshmallows! if this is your only familiarity with this vegetable i don’t think you have had a proper representation on what this delicious root vegetable can bring to a meal. depending on what part of the country you are in you may see sweet potatoes interchanged with “yam. ” in some places sweet potatoes are white-fleshed and not very sweet. the type i love are also referred to as garnet yams which are a rich yellow-orange color with a brownish skin. sweet potatoes are considered one of the most nutritional vegetables around (if they aren’t soaked in sugar and marshmallows of course! ). they are an excellent source of vitamin a and also boast vitamin c and manganese. in addition sweet potatoes are a good source of copper dietary fiber vitamin b6 potassium and iron. this vegetable has been consumed for at least 10 000 years (sweet potato parts found in peruvian caves have been dated that old). besides the sweet flavor and great source of fiber nutrition that sweet potatoes bring to the table i love how versatile they are. they can be cooked pureed and mixed into pancakes in the morning. yes pancakes! they can be part of a great soup at lunch. also by cutting them into cubes and steaming or roasting then chilling you can add them to salads. or how about this: for lunch one day i reheated some roasted sweet potato spears from dinner the night before added a bit of sesame kale leftover rotisserie chicken and rolled into a sprouted corn tortilla for an unusual taco that my friend kristen still swears is one of her favorite things i’ve ever made. here’s one of the simplest preparations for sweet potatoes: heat your oven to 450 degrees. cut them into one-inch wedges toss them with extra virgin olive oil a bit of soy sauce salt and pepper and roast on a sheet pan until soft (make sure there is space around the spears or they will steam as they cook). they cook much quicker this way then if you were to bake them whole and the flavor is fantastic. so next time you’re at the store and considering buying some plain old russet potatoes why not switch it up and try out the flavorful and nutritious sweet potato?

Actual Doctor's Response:
that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: 1. stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. 2. lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to 10% of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. 3. if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. 4. eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.

Patient Question:
what is bun-creatinine ratio?

Actual Doctor's Response:
bun stands for blood urea nitrogen. creatinine is a natural product of muscle breakdown that occurs at a low level in the body. both bun and creatinine are filtered by the kidney and excreted in urine. for this reason bun and creatinine are used together to measure kidney function. if kidney function begins to decline bun and creatinine rise. a normal creatinine depends on muscle mass and age. in general a normal creatine is 0. 5 to 1. 2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). a normal bun is 7 to 20 mg/dl. remember that different laboratories use different testing equipment and may have slightly different ranges for normal. a small temporary increase in either bun or creatinine can occur during illness or dehydration; the numbers usually return to normal during recovery. in cases of dehydration bun may increase in a higher proportion than the creatinine. a normal bun-to-creatinine ratio is between 10 to 1 and 20 to 1. (for example a bun of 14 and a creatinine of 1. 2 would be a ratio of 12. ) in cases of dehydration the bun-to-creatinine ratio may be higher than 20 to 1 as the kidney responds by making the urine more concentrated. other conditions that cause bun-to-creatinine ratio to rise are kidney disease kidney stones or bleeding in the intestines. low bun-to-creatinine can occur in pregnancy liver disease or a diet low in protein. the bun-to-creatinine ratio is not a precise or reliable test though. it may often be somewhat abnormal in healthy people. more important is the creatinine level itself; if it’s elevated the kidneys are not working properly and the reason should be sought out. i'm very concern about my kidney health since i'm getting older. my father and two of my brothers contracted kidney diisease in their 60's. all are deceased. recent ly i had bloodworkand my bun/creatinine ratio came back high (31) do i need to be concern? my doctor is well aware of my family history for this. thanks 1. 2 to 30 10 answer

bmi is a tool that estimates body fat based on height and weight measures of individuals. as bmi increases so does your risk for heart disease high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. but this tool is not perfect. it can overestimate body fat in individuals who are very lean but weigh more like athletes and it can underestimate body fat in people who are thin but have low muscle tone. bmi is calculated from your height and weight and is used as an indirect screening tool for body fat and risk of diseases or other health conditions. bmi does have its limitations however as some individuals such as athletes may have a high bmi because of increased muscle mass. as a result they might have a high bmi but not a high percentage of body fat. there are other more direct measurement techniques for body fat percentage; some of which include: • underwater weighing • air displacement • dual energy x-ray • bioelectrical impedance • skinfold measurements there are however trade-offs with each method. the more accurate methods tend to require specialized equipment that can be very expensive and require additional training and take longer to implement. the quicker and cheaper methods may not require much additional training but may not be as accurate. researchers have to choose which method will best fit their needs. let's just keep it simple. if your waist is above 45% of your height you are too fat and if you work on just that number you will become lean and healthy. for example a man who is 72" tall (6') need to keep his waist under 32" and a woman who is 68" tall (5"8") needs to keep her waist under 30". just measure your height in inches and multiply times. 45. another easy way is if your pants waist is not smaller than your pants length it is time to eat less and exercise more. mike at everyouncecounts@gmail. com

paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen in the united states and is marketed as tylenol along with other product names. anacin is a combination of aspirin and caffeine. both are effective medications and both have potentially harmful side effects. paracetamol can through its breakdown products cause damage to the liver and kidney. generally doses should be kept below four grams per day although some physicians believe that when used chronically the dose should be kept below two grams per day. aspirin's most common side effect is gastric upset and ulceration. it also interferes with blood clotting which is why it is used to help prevent heart disease. with large toxic doses it can cause life-threatening problems with acidosis (excessive acid in the fluids and tissues of the body). a standard maximum daily dosage is six 325 mg pills per day. these drugs can also in large doses cause difficulty with hearing including tinnitus and deafness. you should let your family physician know what you are taking so that he or she can monitor you for side effects and possible drug interactions. in addition you need to be aware of what is in other over-the-counter medications that you take to make sure that they do not have either paracetamol or aspirin in them making your daily intake of these medications higher than you think.

Patient Question:
can a girl get pregnant with an unsevered hymen? . if you ejaculate a small amount of semen on the outside of a vagina of a virgin girl and she wipes her vagina off afterwards and takes a shower can she still get pregnant and what are the chances?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it is possible to become pregnant without full-penetration sex. while it may be uncommon ejaculation at the vaginal opening does put this woman at risk for pregnancy. if you do not want an unintentional pregnancy you should not be doing this sort of risky activity. keeping viable sperm as far away as possible from a vagina would be in your best interest. use a condom or stop playing sexual russian roulette.

Patient Question:
i get boils/absesses in my pubic area but they only happen at certain times of the year like fall/winter. . they start out as just a small red bump but usually get to the size of a quarter. they make a head and some pus and blood drain out but may remain red and hard under the skin for a week or so.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it may have sometime to do with your fall/winter attire. many of these boils start out as folliculitis (an infection around the hair follicles) so heat and/moisture in this area can be contributory to seasonal outbreaks. i don't know if you are shaving in this area but this too can be a factor.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this and i hope you get a diagnosis soon. though i'm hoping you don't have ulcerative colitis! the thing with blood is that a little can look like a lot especially when it's dispersed in a bowl of toilet water. even a couple drops of blood in the toilet can give the water the appearance a blood bath has taken place. i mention this in part to help calm your anxiety about this. the chances are you're not losing as much blood as you think. if there's any way for you to measure the blood loss (i know sounds gross but you could for example purchase from a medical supply store a "hat" or plastic measuring basin that fits under the toilet seat for those times when only blood comes out) you'd have a better idea of how much blood you're really losing. it's probably not more than a tablespoon or so at a time but since i'm not there to see it it could be more. it would be good for your doctor to know. losing blood is always unnerving but the human body can endure quite a lot of blood loss before serious problems occur. if you do experience fainting or if your pulse rate stays elevated then you definitely need to call your doctor. meanwhile you can help avoid those symptoms by drinking plenty of fluid to keep your circulating volume up. i wish you all the best with this!

Actual Doctor's Response:
it is possible. any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect. however not all new symptoms are caused by medications. you would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash.

if the redness and itchiness is in the same spot as where you applied the patch this is a common side effect of patches applied to the skin. it is important when you use a patch to rotate the sites of application each day and to try and avoid using the same spot for at least 7 days. this can help curb the local reaction caused by the patch. if it happens every day wherever you apply the patch you could be allergic to one of the ingredients in the patch. you can ask your pharmacist to suggest a different patch or a different method to help you quit smoking if you are allergic to the patch you are using.

Patient Question:
how can toxoplasmosis during pregnancy be prevented?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you are not pregnant (or not planning to be pregnant soon) and have a healthy immune system you do not need to prevent toxoplasmosis infection. it is a passing infection with mild or no symptoms. if you have had toxoplasmosis you cannot get it again. this is because your immune system has learned how to fight it. this immunity protects both you and your fetus from toxoplasmosis. you can have a blood test to learn whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis. if you are pregnant or plan to be pregnant soon if you do not know whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis or know that you are not immune avoid contact with the toxoplasma parasite to protect your fetus from infection. avoid cat feces in both the home and the garden. if you have a cat and you are either pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon have someone else clean the cat litter box. if you must clean the box yourself do it daily. the toxoplasma eggs take 1 to 5 days to become infectious. 4 wear gloves and a face mask and wash your hands afterward. make a habit of washing any table or counter surfaces that a cat may have walked across. consider keeping your cat indoors. a cat who goes outdoors is likely to become infected with toxoplasma gondii by eating infected birds or rodents. (eating indoor mice also poses a risk. ) when gardening or handling soil wear gloves and wash your hands afterward. wash all foods that could have had contact with cat feces including commercial fruits and vegetables. eat only well-cooked or previously frozen meat. avoid dried meats. sustained high or low temperatures are needed to kill toxoplasma gondii in meat. carefully wash your hands and all utensils after preparing raw meat poultry seafood fruits or vegetables. avoid untreated drinking water. this is a concern when you are in the wilderness or are traveling to developing countries where drinking water is not treated. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

if you have chronic high blood pressure (hypertension) you can lower your blood pressure before pregnancy by exercising eating a diet low in sodium and rich in fruits and vegetables and staying at a healthy weight. lowering your blood pressure reduces your risk of preeclampsia. when you are pregnant regular checkups are key to early detection and treatment. prompt treatment is vital to preventing the development of severe and possibly life-threatening preeclampsia. recent preeclampsia research suggests that calcium supplements and low-dose aspirin offer a preventive benefit especially for high-risk women. calcium supplements may reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia and the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby particularly among high-risk women who normally don't get enough calcium. 4 taking a calcium supplement may also lower the risk of moving from mild to severe preeclampsia. 13 other experts have found that there is no benefit from taking calcium. 1 but all pregnant women can generally benefit from taking the u. s. food and drug administration's recommended daily allowance of of calcium each day to keep their bones healthy. low-dose aspirin (antiplatelet) therapy may be a moderately effective preventive treatment for women at risk of developing preeclampsia. although some experts question how effective low-dose aspirin is others assert that high-risk women who take it regularly as directed do significantly lower their preeclampsia risk. 14 talk to your doctor or nurse- midwife about whether this treatment is right for you. research shows that taking vitamin c or vitamin e supplements does not help prevent preeclampsia. 15 16 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of congestive heart failure by causing a cardiomyopathy -- which is a medical term used to describe weakness of the heart muscle. this can result in swelling like your husband is experiencing. in addition liver damage from alcohol can also cause swelling. it sounds as though he should see a doctor urgently to try to help treat his symptoms and he would benefit greatly from some assistance to help him stop drinking.

nutrition is one of the areas that caregivers often must assume responsibility for. even if the person's alzheimer's is at an early stage. a short-term memory deficit can result in one forgetting if he/she ate or not. thus meals may be missed or one might eat multiple meals at each sitting. impaired judgment another symptom even at an early stage can impact on dietary choices. thus someone who never ate fats or salt (or carbs as you mentioned) may begin to crave these previously "forbidden" foods. sweets especially fall into this category and may provide pleasure that one had forsaken due to sugar problems or concern with weight. this problem can become a "quality of life" issue and that is where the caregiver must make choices. "should i restrict my loved one's diet because it may cause medical problems or should i look away and let him/her have some enjoyment" is the dilemma. some helpful strategies include daily dietary monitoring keeping nutritious food visible on the shelves (even transferred into boxes of more desired foods! ) and buying low-fat and low-salt foods and snacks only. if the "undesired" food is not available it will not be eaten. the one strategy to be avoided is trying to reason with your loved one in order to change her/his behavior. advice and counseling can agitate and will probably be forgotten.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry you're going through this. i want to caution you however that you should never self-administer antibiotics. it's this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. your best bet is to see a medical professional. your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work. it could as you speculate be a virus. if it is it should clear up in 7-14 days. no antibiotics required. however it could be something other than a virus. many conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth. the only way to find out is to visit a health care provider. i wish you all the best!

while it's possible for people to experience muscle stimulation from pacemakers it's typically the diaphragm as it lies close the the right ventricle which is actually being paced. while i can't diagnose the cause of your muscle twitching in this forum i would guess that left pectoralis stimulation would be pretty unlikely particularly if it doesn't seem related to your heart rate. always helpful to get checked out by your doctor if you have any concerns.

in emphysema the walls of the air sacs (alveolar septae) are destroyed. consequently the individual air spaces (alveoli) become larger but irregular and decreased in number. these larger spaces are less efficient than normal sized alveoli for gas exchange. thus emphysema impairs diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange). the more extensive the emphysema the poorer the gas exchange becomes. also in emphysema the capillaries are destroyed with the rest of the alveolar wall. as a result emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply emphysema usually starts in the upper lobes of the lung and is more severe in the upper lobes for complex reasons. that is the abnormal (enlarged and irregular) air sacs (alveoli) are more prominent in the upper lobes. (the blood vessels in the lungs should not be mistaken for the abnormal air sacs. ) in someone with severe emphysema the entire chest actually can enlarge. what probably happens is that the patient's extra (compensatory) efforts to suck in as much air as possible (to increase ventilation) contribute to enlarging the lungs and the chest. thus a person with severe emphysema often develops what has been described as a barrel-chest.

if you have a "normal" 28 day cycle ovulation would be around day 14. your most fertile days would be days 10 to 17. three weeks before your period was due would be day 7 which would be a bit too early as sperm live a maximum of 5 days. they'd probably be dead before you ovulated.

only if the boil had teeth. use hot compresses but if the boil is getting worse see your medical provider so it can be properly treated. treatment may include lancing the boil to relieve the pus and/or antibiotics.

broccoli is a great vegetable and can add texture flavor and nutrition quickly and easily. start your day with an extra boost of vitamin c (not just from orange juice) by tossing broccoli into your breakfast scramble or omelet. add it to your lunch by finely chopping it and stir into soup or toss in a salad raw. break out of the “steamed” box at dinner and change up the side dish by roasting broccoli in the oven. the trick is to use a high heat (450 degrees) for 5-7 minutes. first slice a head of broccoli into quarter-inch to half-inch pieces. spread them out on a sheet pan drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and splash with soy sauce and sesame seeds. another variation is to drizzle with extra virgin olive oil sea salt and fresh chopped herbs. finally try adding a minced shallot and a dash of sea salt and red pepper chili flakes. again all of these variations are completed within 5-7 minutes in a hot oven. and you can use this method with many different vegetables including swiss chard kale cauliflower and asparagus. my shortcut when i’m teaching classes is: “olive oil salt pepper heat. ” it’s an easy way to remember a great tip on preparing delicious veggies quickly. i haven’t come up with any broccoli desserts but if i get inspired i will let you know! you will not hear me advocating for you to sneak them into a brownie or cake — i am passionately convinced that if you make a vegetable delicious and not overcooked you will never need to hide or sneak them into your meals! with your other three meals you can find many ways to utilize this inexpensive nutritious and delicious vegetable.

ok im gaining weight like im pregnant pregnancy test coming up positive but had a sonogram done an no baby what is it. my boobs also hurt i have all the signs of being pregant but i also want to be pregnant verybadly what could be goin on

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think this is something you should discuss with your gynecologist. it's possible you're experiencing a false pregnancy (the medical term is pseudocyesis) but the fact your home pregnancy test returned a positive result concerns me. there are a few rare cancers that can mimic the symptoms of pregnancy and you should ask to have those ruled out. you might also consider making an appointment with a counselor to discuss your situation. a counselor can help you cope with feelings of disappointment from not being pregnant when you so badly want to be and also can help you understand why your mind might be causing your body to exhibit the symptoms of pregnancy when you're not pregnant. wishing you all the best!

Patient Question:
painful mole or skin tag burns constantly. a few years ago i noticed a small bump under my left armpit. at first it never bothered me and i thought it was going to turn into a skin tag but it never has. it is like a small plateau shaped mole that is about the same color as my skin. it constantly has a throbbing burning sensation to it and sometimes stings like being stung or poked with a needle. it is more irritating than anything and i was just wondering what it could be?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i would be wondering as well but you cannot make an important diagnostic call based solely on a brief description. any skin lesion that is painful or changing deserves to have a professional look at it first-hand. if the dermatologist is not sure (not all skin lesions can be identified by appearance alone) then it may be recommended to have it surgically removed. you would then have a "cure" (since it would be gone) and a pathological diagnosis -- the most accurate.

you are asking a question that could not be answered over the internet. we do not know anything about you your medical history. but more importantly we have no way of examining you and/or ordering any diagnostic tests. before attributing any medical condition to stress or anxiety a medical provider must first rule out all organic causes that could be attributed to your array of symptoms. i would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- for a thorough diagnostic evaluation.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if the bleeding was from the same side of the nose you may be experiening one nose bleed that has recurred three times. this happens when the scab that forms either fails to adhere to the slippery mucous lining and bleeds again or a probing finger dislodges it. as long as your child is not bruised in other areas or anemic nose bleeds are often more annoying than serious. you do need to know the proper way of controlling the bleeding so check on the webmd site for "nosebleeds" and you will find some helpful information. with that said. i am a bit concerned about the head injury. since i have no way to take a more thorough medical history or examine him this should be address with his medical provider. he doesn't have a head injury it was more for a "bump" than a "hit".

Patient Question:
how do i treat a pulled calf muscle? . if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury. painful calf muscle strains deserve “price” therapy (see below) and complete calf muscle tears (which are rare) may need surgical repair. the vast majority of pulled calf muscles will heal completely within a few weeks without any treatment. pulled muscles are also called muscle strains. they occur when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their normal length. the injury creates tears in the muscle that are usually tiny (microtears). in the most severe calf muscle strains the entire muscle is torn causing significant swelling and pain. the calf muscle (also called the gastrocnemius) is a commonly injured muscle. a pulled calf muscle most often occurs after vigorous activity (running jumping climbing stairs) but can happen with normal activity in middle-aged and elderly people. pain possibly with some swelling or bruising is the main symptom of a calf muscle strain. immediately after a pulled calf muscle using “price” therapy may help speed healing: p for protect from re-injury r for rest i for immobilize with tape or an athletic bandage wrap c for compression (make that wrap tight but not so tight your leg goes numb) e for elevate (keeping your calf muscle above your heart may reduce swelling) price actually stands for prevention rest ice compression evaluate elevate*** i had the same thing happen to me. you need to go to a sports medicine doctor and get an x-ray of you ankle. it might sound crazy but there is a possibility that you broke your tibia in your ankle. when you break your tibia your calf hurts then your ankle starts to hurt. i had this happen and i went to my physician and they said it was a mild sprang so i walked around for a month with a broken ankle and i just found out three weeks ago and i am still in a cast.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i know you are worried debbie (please do not use your name in these postings or they may be deleted) and your doctor is wise to search for the many reasons for your anemia and finding what that abdominal mass might be is high on the list. the ct is a very accurate test so you will know more information once the scan has been read. obviously a cancer would be something to consider but not all abdominal masses are cancerous. if you are also having obvious or occult (hidden) rectal bleeding (detected on those stool tests) then this could be the source of your anemia but remember there are many different types of anemia. not just anemia from blood loss. your anemia is considered severe in my opinion so all efforts should be done to find the reason(s). if the ct shows that your mass is "suspicious" then the surgeon will take over your case.

Patient Question:
where do i start if i have never exercised?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park farther away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. whichever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals: write down what activity you plan to do on what day of the week for how long and at what time of day. be as specific and realistic as possible. for instance write down "tuesday: walk for 20 minutes at 7 p. m. to the park and back. " at the end of each week review your goals and set new ones for the upcoming week. research shows that setting goals will help you stick to your program. it will clarify what you're supposed to do and let you track your progress. if you hit a roadblock later on you can refer back to what has worked in the past or use your accomplishments to re-energize yourself.

first make sure that your doctor clears you for exercise before beginning. he or she may ask you to fill out the physical activity readiness questionnaire (par-q) to ensure that there is no reason for you not to exercise. i would then recommend setting personal goals using the s. m. a. r. t. acronym which stands for: s – specific m – measureable a – attainable r – realistic t – time-oriented here’s a sample goal keeping these principles in mind: “between january 1st and february 1st walk three days per week for twenty minutes per session to aid in weight loss. ” set up short term goals to help you meet your long term goals (6 months or more). think about what you want to achieve by beginning an exercise routine. do you want to lose weight lower your blood pressure or help manage diabetes? do you want to run a race such as a 5k? what do you hope to gain from starting exercise? the biggest problem that people have is that they overwhelm themselves by doing too much exercise too soon. it can be hard to sustain a drastic change like that long term. instead slowly and gradually progress with exercise to make for an easier transition and to allow your body to comfortably adjust. start out doing low impact exercise like walking or riding a bike then gradually increase the time intensity level or number of days per week that you exercise. if you’re new to strength training get help from a personal trainer to make sure that you are using the equipment properly. make a plan and stick to it.

Patient Question:
what surgery options do i have for genital herpes?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is no need for surgical treatment for genital herpes. but if you are pregnant and genital herpes is diagnosed or suspected at the time of labor and delivery a cesarean section (surgical) delivery may be recommended to protect the baby from getting a herpes simplex infection which can cause serious health problems. a mother can pass the herpes simplex virus (hsv) to her baby if she has a sore or blister present during a vaginal delivery. the biggest risk occurs during a first-time (primary) outbreak of genital herpes. usually in these cases the woman either does not have symptoms or is unaware of symptoms. experts disagree about the use of cesarean section delivery in women with recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes. if a pregnant woman has recurrent outbreaks the risk of passing the virus to her baby is less than 1% because the baby has some immune protection from the mother. 1 cesarean section may be recommended if a woman has symptoms such as tingling or pain (prodromal symptoms) that signal an impending outbreak. for these women acyclovir ( zovirax ) used in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy may reduce the need for delivery by cesarean section by reducing the risk of a recurrent outbreak at the time of delivery. a cesarean section is usually not done if a woman with recurrent genital herpes has blisters or sores only on her thighs buttocks or another area that is not close to the vagina. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
how many ribs do we have?

Actual Doctor's Response:
both men and women have 24 ribs twelve on each side. each rib is attached to a spinal bone (thoracic vertebra) in the back. the first seven pairs of ribs join the breastbone (sternum) in the center of the chest. the front ends of the eighth ninth and 10th pairs are connected to the ribs above them. the 11th and 12th pairs are called “floating ribs ” because they are anchored in place only by connective tissue. one in every few hundred people have an extra rib. these are called cervical ribs because they arise from one of the spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae).

Patient Question:
what are some other possible early side effects from radiation therapy besides fatigue skin problems and hair loss?

Actual Doctor's Response:
other early side effects are usually specific to the site that receives the radiation. eating problems radiation therapy to the head neck or parts of the digestive system can result in loss of interest in eating. but it's important to continue to eat a healthy diet while undergoing treatment in order to maintain your health and keep up your strength. eating five or six small meals spread out through the day often works better than trying to eat three larger meals. trying new recipes can help you maintain your interest in eating. keeping healthy snacks that you enjoy on hand will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and perhaps losing your appetite. mouth problems before you start radiation to the head or neck see your dentist for a thorough exam to help reduce subsequent problems once therapy starts. radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: sores lack of saliva thickened saliva difficulty swallowing jaw stiffness. it's important to tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help reduce the discomfort you feel. to help manage these side effects: avoid spicy and acidic foods. don't smoke chew tobacco or drink alcohol. brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. hearing problems radiation therapy to the head can cause hearing difficulties. one possible cause is hardening of the wax in your ears caused by radiation. let your doctor know if you have difficulty hearing. nausea radiation to the head neck and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. let your doctor know if that occurs because there are medicines you can use to help control nausea. also the doctor or the nurse can help you learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. diarrhea radiation therapy to the stomach or abdomen can cause diarrhea which typically starts a few weeks after starting the therapy. the doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control the diarrhea as well as suggest changes in your diet such as eating frequent small meals avoiding high-fiber foods and being sure to get enough potassium. fertility and sexual issues radiation therapy in the region of the pelvis can affect your fertility and your sex drive. it's also important not to try to become pregnant during radiation therapy because radiation can hurt the fetus. radiation therapy of the pelvic region can cause women to stop having menstrual periods and to experience other symptoms of menopause. it's important to talk with your doctor about what kind of effect radiation might have on your ability to have children in the future. in men radiation in an area that includes the testes can affect the sperm count as well as the functionality of the sperm. this doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. but if you want to have children later you should talk with your doctor about considering the use of a sperm bank before treatment begins. treatment to the pelvis can cause sexual intercourse to be painful for some women and can also cause scarring that affects the ability of the vagina to stretch. in men radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that make an erection possible. you should discuss your concerns with your doctor before treatment begins to learn about your options and possible outcomes. it's natural to have less interest in sex when undergoing treatment for cancer. but typically your sex drive will reawaken after treatment stops. talk with your spouse and share your concerns about the need for being close.

how can computers affect my child’s sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you should probably be looking at what your children are looking at on the internet anyway whether it’s video games or things of that nature. just sitting in front of a screen and the light that is produced from that screen actually has been shown in one japanese study to affect the child’s circadian rhythm. in what way? well what it can do is it can actually throw off the circadian rhythm. they found with laptop computers with both adults and i want to say it was high school age kids that they found that it actually made them stay awake because light in front of them doesn’t produce the melatonin during that portion of the night. i usually recommend parents to have times for the tv times for the computer and not to go past those times and to really limit that access.

the first thing to do after a bee or other insect sting is look at the skin. if there’s a stinger there pull it out. this will prevent the release of more venom into the skin and avoid a prolonged reaction to the stinger. people’s reactions after bee stings vary widely and so does the appropriate treatment. most people develop only a minor local reaction to a bee sting. redness and painful swelling up to around two inches across are normal. cold compresses and over-the-counter pain relievers are adequate treatment. about 10% of people develop what are called large local reactions. this is an ongoing reaction to the sting with a large area of inflamed painful swollen skin. the reaction and its symptoms can continue to get worse for 48 hours and take up to 10 days to resolve. call your doctor if symptoms are still getting worse a few hours after a sting or if the reaction looks alarming. prescription anti-inflammatory medicines like prednisone and topical steroids may help. at home cold compresses and over-the-counter pain medicines can also be used. the worst reaction to a bee sting is called a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. this is a whole-body life-threatening reaction to insect venom. it doesn’t occur often but when it does people often underestimate the seriousness of the symptoms: • itching or rash in areas of skin away from the sting. • hoarseness or shortness of breath. • lightheadedness. people can develop anaphylaxis even without a previous serious reaction to bee stings. if you have any of these symptoms of anaphylaxis after an insect sting seek immediate medical attention or call 911.

can one refuse psych treatments under obamacare based on religious preference?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer i'm not sure i fully understand the question but let me try to cover as many bases as possible. certainly you won't be required to undergo any psychological treatments as a result of the law. unless treatment is court ordered you always have the right to refuse it. if what you're asking is whether you can buy a health plan that does not pay for mental health and substance abuse services the answer is no. there are religious exemptions under the law that would allow you -- if you meet criteria -- to avoid having to buy insurance at all. but there is no way for you to buy an insurance policy and pick and choose the specific benefits that come with it based on your personal belief system.

Similarity Score: 1.0000
hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. many illnesses and conditions can cause inflammation of the liver for example drugs alcohol chemicals and autoimmune diseases. many viruses for example the virus of mononucleosis and the cytomegalovirus can inflame the liver. most viruses however do not primarily attack the liver; the liver is just one of several organs that the viruses affect. when doctors speak of viral hepatitis they usually are referring to hepatitis caused by a few specific viruses that primarily attack the liver. there are several hepatitis viruses; they have been named types a b c d e f (not confirmed) and g. as our knowledge of hepatitis viruses grows it is likely that this alphabetical list will become longer. the most common hepatitis viruses are types a b and c. the liver is located in the upper righthand side of the abdomen mostly behind the rib cage. the liver of an adult normally weighs close to 3 pounds. the liver performs the following vital functions: the liver helps purify the blood by changing harmful chemicals into harmless ones. the source of these chemicals can be external such as medications or alcohol or internal such as ammonia or bilirubin. typically these harmful chemicals are broken down into smaller chemicals or attached to other chemicals that then are eliminated from the body in the urine or stool. the liver produces many important substances especially proteins that are necessary for good health. for example it produces albumin the protein building block of the body as well as the proteins that cause blood to clot properly. the liver stores many sugars fats and vitamins until they are needed elsewhere in the body. the liver builds smaller chemicals into larger more complicated chemicals that are needed elsewhere in the body. an example of this type of function is the manufacture of cholesterol. when the liver is inflamed it does not perform these functions well which brings about many of the symptoms signs and problems associated with hepatitis.

Actual Doctor's Response:
except for some vitamins little is known about using dietary supplements while pregnant. some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. but most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. these products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy. in the u. s. there are different laws for medicines and for dietary supplements. the part of the fda that controls dietary supplements is the same part that controls foods sold in the u. s. only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before october 15 1994 submit safety information for review by the fda. however unlike medicines herbal remedies and "natural products" are not approved by the fda for safety or for what they say they will do. most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. before a company can sell a medicine the company must complete many studies and send the results to the fda. many scientists and doctors at the fda check the study results. the fda allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.

regular multivitamins and prenatal vitamins are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or prenatal vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. it is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect like spina bifida in which the spine or brain does not form the right way. iron can help prevent a low blood count (anemia). it's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. too many vitamins can harm your baby. for example very high levels of vitamin a have been linked with severe birth defects.

most helpful answer well i'm no expert on this but i doubt you messed up the drug screen. first of all 500ml is not very much water for the kidneys to process especially not over the course of four hours. second many people who take multivitamins are subjected to random drug screens. there's no evidence taking a vitamin affects the results in any way. urine drug screening tests are quite sensitive. they will detect very small concentrations of molecules. if it were possible to skew urine drug screens simply by drinking excessive amounts of water everyone who takes illicit drugs would beat the tests by doing just that. but you don't hear of that happening. by the way i would never advise anyone to try drinking excessive amounts of water in order to "cheat" a urine drug screen. drinking large quantities of water over a short period of time can be very dangerous leading to a potentially fatal condition called "water intoxication.

Patient Question:
will losing weight help my urinary incontinence problems?

Actual Doctor's Response:
well here's another reason to lose a few. if you are having urinary incontinence problems you may find that losing some weight will make the problems less severe or they may go away altogether. many studies have shown a connection between obesity and urinary incontinence in women especially stress urinary incontinence (you leak when you are coughing laughing or putting physical "stress" on your bladder). excess body weight tends to increase bladder pressure (increased weight on the bladder and pelvis) and may also impair blood flow and nerve impulses to the bladder. studies show a positive correlation between high bmi. and urinary incontinence and the correlation is more pronounced in women than in men. research has also shown that very obese women who undergo extreme weight loss due to gastric surgery see a decrease in their stress urinary incontinence symptoms. in other studies women who achieved a greater than 5% weight loss following weight watchers experienced a greater than 50% reduction in their urinary incontinence symptoms. that means that if you weigh 200 pounds and lose just 11 of them you could reduce your incontinence issues by half! losing weight if you are overweight and maintaining normal weight throughout adulthood may be important approaches to controlling or eliminating urinary incontinence symptoms especially in women.

Actual Doctor's Response:
no it's not unusual. the effects of the illness will still exist because it takes a while (a week or so) for the bug to be annihilated by the penicillin and your immune system. also penicillin increases your white blood cell count and so your own body is still fighting the bug. the medication itself doesn't fight it. your body is still going through the purging process of getting rid of the bug. so you will still feel sick and tired for a while. taking too much penicillin can cause ill effects as well so try not to do that. just let it run it's course.

compare palliative with hospice care

Actual Doctor's Response:
palliative care and hospice care often are mentioned in the same sentence as if they are the same thing. they are not but they do share certain characteristics. hospice is care for people at the end of their lives and their families. hospice care encompasses physical emotional and spiritual support. it is not offered only to the dying person but to the entire family as well. hospice care is not about prolonging life; it is about providing comfort care and measures designed to enhance the dying person's quality of life. and this is the point where hospice and palliative care overlap. palliative care too is about maximizing a person's quality of life. however palliative care is not just for patients with limited life expectancy. any person with a serious illness or chronic medical condition may benefit from palliative care. palliative care takes a holistic approach to addressing pain--physical and/or emotional--and other issues of comfort. for example a palliative physician might order special skin creams to minimize the pain and tissue irritation from radiation therapy for cancer. palliative team members may include specially trained physicians nurses psychotherapists social workers physical therapist occupational therapists nursing assistants and others. this team focuses treatment on the patient but also offers support to family members. i hope this helps!

Actual Doctor's Response:
maybe. yellow-green mucous is not a definitive sign of a bacterial infection in a two year old but it could be. this color change is usually caused by stagnation of the flow of mucous just the way a pond turns green if there is not a good in and out flow of water. two year olds do not blow their noses. if your child is ill or feverish. if he seems to be getting progressively worse. then yes seeing his medical provider would be a wise decision.

Patient Question:
i have a very high metabolism and i can't gain weight. how can i lower my metabolism while exercising more? . i'm 20 years old 6' tall and weigh only about 150-155. i'm also not very active. i want to start running and lifting weights but it's tough for me to gain muscle because i have a very hard time putting on weight. what can i do to lower my metabolism enough to start putting on weight and getting bigger? i also don't eat very well but tend to eat a descent amount of protein every day.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the goal should not be to lower your metabolism but to start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain. it doesn't matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein calories and nutrients. that's because inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake (total calories) means protein is used for energy instead of for muscle formation. exercising more can increase your appetite and weight training can gradually help you put on muscle. it may take time to see results but because muscle weighs more than fat you are likely to gain weight. here are some tips: eat regular meals and snacks every day. try to plan your meals ahead of time and have items you can put together for quick and healthy meals. gradually build a list of balanced meals you can make for yourself. include 3-5 food groups at meals including a whole grain lean protein fruits vegetables dairy and healthy fats. for example in the morning you might have a big bowl of oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts and a side boiled egg. include 2-3 food groups at snack time which may consist of cheese and whole grain crackers or an apple with peanut butter or half a meat sandwich with veggie sticks. gradually increase exercise to include cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. for tips on how to exercise to build muscle see this article. what you may discover during this process is how much better you feel by moving more and eating better. you won't regret starting on a healthier road! i here this a great deal at the school i teach at. if you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan. first keep a food diary for three days. are you really eating as much as you think? when counseling athletes at school i generally recommend they consume 1. 8-2. 0 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. so for you at 150 lbs = 68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122 -136 grams a day. now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need. develop an eating plan. here's an example: breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk protein in meal = 20 grams lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts (8 ounces) 2 cups of veggies (broccoli green beans califlower) 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt protein in meal = 69 grams dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin (3 ounces) remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 1/2 cup fat free cottage cheese protein in meal = 38 grams snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter (protein: 7 grams) 1/4 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit (protein: 12 grams) total protein for the day = 147 grams notice there's no junk food (chips soft drinks etc) or any expensive supplements just good solid nutritional foods. regarding exercise the best way to add weight is by adding muscle. to do this you need a well thought out strength training plan. follow the link pasted below to find a great beginners workout on webmd <link> as you advance you can find some additional info here <link> <link> like i said earlier the key to healthy weight gain is with a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan both of which you can find here at webmd. to be on the safe side be sure to check with your physician before starting. i had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts. i had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class. let's keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle mass/weight. 1. rest - get two days/week of rest to recover from training. you grow when you're resting. you can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously. take it easy on those days and don't do anything too physical. 2. train - lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 1/2 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics. next day do it in reverse. repeat this cycle throughout the week. if you're an athlete you'll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day. when running do sprints. do high impact high intensity exericises. do not perform long-distance endurance training. if you have to run don't go over 3 miles. 3. eat - consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits. 3/4 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat. 1/4 of your meal should be protein to build muscle. contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle. consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein. you want that carb for energy to push harder and grow bigger/stronger. eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal. you will bulk up in size/strength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month. if you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs. always drink a ton of water! find people with similar goals to train with! it's not just about building your body it's also about building a community. good luck!

families often feel emotional at holiday time especially if a parent is unable to join them to celebrate. you and your sister seem to be aware and respectful of your mother's needs and comfort and that is to be commended. you are doing her a service by not overwhelming her in a crowd. if it is possible you can celebrate with her in a different setting and at a different time. most facilities plan holiday celebrations for residents at a time different from the specific holiday. this enables families to come there and dine with their loved ones rather than taking them out of their "comfort zone. " if her memory support unit does not offer this then you can plan your own "mock thanksgiving dinner" with her. it is common for memory-impaired persons to be disoriented to day/time so you will be creating a thanksgiving day of your own.

Patient Question:
why is a “power down hour” important to good sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
one of the things i talk about in my book is having what’s called a powered down hour. and in the power down hour you have 3 twenty minute segments. so the first segment is forgetting stuff done that you just have to get done or it will drive you crazy. so in our house it’s getting backpacks ready for school finding shoes you know things that you do when you have kids. the second twenty minutes is reserved for hygiene so brush your teeth wash your face maybe even take a hot shower or bath. the final twenty minutes is reserved for meditation relaxation stretching things of that nature that i’d want you to do in bed and i’d want you to do it in the dark okay. because what that does is again it sets that mood and allows you to start to fall asleep. now many people don’t have an hour before they get into bed so you can do the power down half hour if you want like 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes.

how soon i see if hormon therapy change me from male to female

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer well i hope you understand that taking female hormones alone will never physically change your genitalia to that of a woman. in other words you will still have a penis and scrotum. however female hormones will gradually feminize your appearance and you will grow breasts. as i say this is a gradual process. it doesn't happen overnight. more like weeks to months. if you're transgender (as i'm assuming you are) i hope you're under the care of a trusted medical professional. i've had the privilege of working with many transgender patients and i know that products circulate illicitly within the community. i would urge you not to attempt to use female hormones without medical supervision. you don't necessarily know what you're getting with some of those black market products products purchased from websites and so on. if you are under the care of a medical professional good for you! he or she should be able to help guide you through the complexities of changing genders. i wish you all the best on this journey!

Patient Question:
what are all the treatment options for straightening a penis that has been bent in an angle due to tight underwear? . 19 year old. had a perfectly natural straight penis with an upward curve (like a perfect banana) in childhood up until puberty. used to wear tight underwear and slept in a certain way (putting penis in between legs) with erection until morning. penis no longer curves upwards but now curves downwards and to the right. when i'm excited penis gets very hard especially glans and the shaft turns into an hourglass figure which feels good & goes away after full erection. penis doesn't hurt at all

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are two chambers in the shaft of the penis called the corpus cavernosa. when blood engorges the corpus it should equally fill but in some cases one side gets more blood than the other causing a deviation. in severe cases where one side of the corpus does not engorge at all this is called peyronie's disease. the blood supply may be due to a plaque or blockage. this is not caused by tight underwear. as a matter of fact tight underwear should have no adverse effect on the angle of your erection whatsoever. since you cannot be adequately diagnosed over the internet and since this change is concerning you you will need to see a urologist (find a male urologist) to be properly evaluated.

is it possible to have had chlamydia for over 17 years and not know it? after having a child as well with no symptoms? . i was recently hospitalized with abdomen pain. they did the regular std checks to rule out pid. all came back negative but they want to take one for chlamydia. i have only been with my husband for over 17 years and vise versa. is it really possible i could have had it that long and not known? or am i worrying for nothing?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi you should find this info very interesting and the way chlamyda can hide for many years. most unfortunate is the ability of chlamydia to hide itself deep inside the genitourinary tract making it very difficult to detect by urethral swabbing and urine analysis; two commonly used sample collection methods for chlamydia testing in clinical practice. thus many urologists and std doctors are unable to identify chlamydia as a causative pathogen. as a result they often make general diagnosis such as non-specific urethritis prostatitis and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) etc. and they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patient’s condition more complicated; weakening the immune system causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative pathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc. do hope this helps good luck

vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue. an accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesn't directly point to either condition. an endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex. your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause. however other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn. i would talk to my gynecologist if it's that much blood. at first i was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if it's a showstopper then that's another story. then did some looking around and fibroids or polyps could be the culprit and they don't affect a pap smear. i had a polyp once and went through a d&c and never had issues again. with fibroids i hear they can come back. i also read that some of this might be hormonal and since you have had a hysterectomy this might make sense. bottom line i'd go see your gyno. hope this helps.

Patient Question:
is it ok to break your blood pressure tablet in half later if your blood pressure is still high. i take blood pressure meds and sometimes it still goes up. not for long. i was curious can you break your tablet in half and take it if it has been a while since you took the first whole med.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i can see why you would ask this question. it seems like a very logical solution doesn't it? however i would not advise doing this. first of all there are several different types of blood pressure pills. some of them work by relaxing blood vessels. others work in the kidneys. others work by reducing blood volume ("water pills"). taking a little extra of one type of pill might not harm you while taking extra of another type of pill could cause your blood pressure to go dangerously low. second it's normal for your blood pressure to fluctuate throughout the day and even in different situations. for instance your blood pressure may go up if you've recently been walking (or for some people simply standing up). your pressure can go up if you're angry anxious or feeling emotional. on the other hand your blood pressure can go down if you're feeling very relaxed or if you've been lying around all day. this is normal. the important thing with blood pressure medication is that it controls your pressure "on average. " if your pressure usually falls within an acceptable range as determined by your healthcare provider then you're doing fine. however if your pressure is often or regularly elevated even though you take your medication as prescribed then you should let your medical provider know. lastly don't take your blood pressure too often. there's no point. taking it once a day at the same time every day usually is sufficient. take it around noon or 1pm if possible. always write down your readings (and note if you were sitting down walking angry or anything that could affect your reading) and take this information to your doctor appointments. your provider will appreciate getting this feedback. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
first off congratulations on your weight loss! i think you have a couple of choices right now. you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery. in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity. it's best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program. i don't know how much weight you have to lose the calories you've been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration. i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism. you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do. i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight. you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success. and just because you are not losing weight now doesn't mean you won't be able to in the future. good luck!

Actual Doctor's Response:
no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.

there doesn’t seem to be any bigger controversy in nutrition than discussing everyone’s opinion regarding what is the healthiest most ideal diet. my take on the matter is that there doesn’t have to be only one single diet or eating plan that everyone should follow; rather there may be many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and achieve a healthy diet. choosing the right diet can be difficult. the biggest factor that you have to first consider is what’s going to work well for you. try to figure out what you want to accomplish by changing your diet. is there a particular benefit or health outcome that you’re trying to achieve? certain diets may be better than others in providing different health outcomes so you first need to identify what you want to get out of your diet. the next part is to learn to set realistic expectations for yourself. will a certain diet be too restrictive for you or completely eliminate all the foods that you enjoy? do you think that you’ll feel hungry all the time or won’t be able to have anything to eat in social situations? you need to contemplate whether the eating plan that you’re looking at will actually work well for you. of course you may have to make some concessions and compromises with your diet sure but you also need to be realistic in what’s going to be achievable and manageable for you. a good way to start is to make slow and gradual changes to your eating habits. pick maybe one aspect of your diet that you would like to improve upon and work on changing that area first. once you’re successful there begin to make other changes until you finally reach a place where you’re comfortable with your diet. this strategy may work well to help ensure that you don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to make a drastic change or trying to do too much too soon. remember you need to approach this in a manner that you can sustain long term as part of a lifestyle change not as a short term solution to a problem. with all of that said to answer your question the paleo (caveman) diet has become quite popular. it’s a relatively low carbohydrate high protein diet that emphasizes grass-fed beef fish eggs fresh fruits and fresh vegetables; while it excludes dairy grains and refined/processed foods. see if this diet will work for you and feel free to explore other diets by reviewing diets a-z. personally i reccommend the paleo lifestyle. you can get all the information you need online you don't have to buy a book or anything. it is also called the caveman diet and it is pretty balanced. a website called the daily apple (google it) is helpful and also free. i find that eating paleo (or at least mostly paleo) is fairly balanced and fairly low carb. the main idea as you may know is to avoid eating things we wouldn't have had before agriculture. think vegetables lean meat fruit nuts seeds eggs animal based fats fish limited beans. it eliminates a lot of the junk we all eat and it helps you feel a lot fuller and more energetic. the biggest problem for me is cost. i use a somewhat modified version in that i add cheese and yogurt a somewhat pastoralist variation. for healthy dieting combination of slow carbs fast carbs & protein is necessary. so if we have meals containing these in proper combination it will help to loose weight naturally. i'm following a diet called food lovers fat loss system by tryfoodlovers is based on this principle. it helped me to loose fat in a healthy manner.

consuming more calories will help to increase your weight. here are a few healthy tips to follow to increase weight slowly: focus on healthy foods to gain weight. eat foods that are loaded with vitamins minerals nutrients and calories. you can enrich foods with nuts fruits and yogurt. dairy can cause bowel problems for some with ibs and if it is an issue skip those foods. eat more often. increasing the amount of calories you eat each day will help to gain weight. focus on eating 6 times a day with each meal containing a protein starch vegetable and some fat. for example turkey sandwich with mayonnaise on whole-grain bread with a fruit smoothie and carrots. foods that are highest in calories and nutrients are foods with fat especially plant fats. these include nuts peanuts seeds peanut butter almond butter avocados hummus and oils. animal fats provide nutrients and the same amount of calories as plant fats but they also contain saturated fats which can increase the ldl (bad) cholesterol. there are a few things to consider with ibs and diet. make sure to add fiber to your diet if you experience constipation. the fiber helps to absorb water and add bulk to the large intestine making bowel movements easier and more frequent. foods high in fiber include fresh fruits and vegetables wheat bran whole grain breads and cereals and beans (limit these if they cause excess gas). for more information visit these links here and here.

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link>

Patient Question:
what are the side affects of taking 3 to 5 times recomended otc probiotic would it cause unhealthy weight loss. i think this is causing my wife to loss weight by stopping nutrition being absorbed

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as "natural" or "healthy" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the "good flora" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!

Actual Doctor's Response:
tetanus (the disease) is quite rare but the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing it if you have one every ten years. minor burns like you described are not high risk for tetanus. not knowing when you had your last one i cannot advise you specifically but having a tetanus shot now -- if you are due for one anyway -- would be a good idea. i should have added.

Patient Question:
what is epilepsy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than 2 million people in the united states -- about 1 in 100 -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.

you do need to be re-examined but not at the er. you should try and see an ent specialist or at least a primary care provider in their office. the er is really not the right place to properly diagnose and manage these things. while the er is great when you have life-threatening true emergency things like ear infections (or possible ear infections) are often triaged low in priority and quickly "treated and streeted". i don't know if you were misdiagnosed or not but have seen numerous misdiagnoses come from those quick er examinations. yes you could have been misdiagnosed or improperly treated. since eardrops are not the treatment for middle ear infections (unless you have an eardrum rupture or have tubes) i am suspicious when i see both an oral and an eardrop prescribed. i call this "shotgun treatment". the antibiotic may not have been proper or the correct dose or not needed at all (if you really didn't have a middle ear infection). you could have an eustachian tube problem in which case the antibiotic or ear drop would not help. skip the er. go directly an ent if you can or at least see a primary care medical provider who will spend more time with you and get to the bottom of this ear issue. yes go to ent. sometimes i get what sounds like the same thing. the ent does something with tubes and i drink some water and say kkkkk. sounds like witch dr. stuff eh? but it works and i think it kind of blows fluid out of the inner ear. the e. tube in my ear is very narrow so they say and does block up at times. sometimes chewing hard gum like bubble will clear it temporarily. see the ent it is so worth it. my husband lost the hearing in his right ear over the course of 2 hours last february. we have since learned that he should have had treatment with prednisone immediately and he might have had the chance to save his hearing. this is a sensorineural loss and it must be treated as a medical emergency. insist on being treated immediately you have your hearing to lose. thanks rod for your reply. at first i did try to contact my primary but earliest i could get an appointment would be february. in order to see a specialist i would need a referral and my insurance does not cover urgent care centers either. that is why i ended up going to the er. i'm going out of state tonight and wouldn't be able to do anything till i get back in over a week. i'm just concerned and the er would be my only option at this point.

it's hard to say. so many illnesses begin with the symptoms you describe that guessing what you have would be folly. you'll have to wait until things progress a bit further to really know what's going on. that said you might consider calling your medical provider to let them know about this because the flu (influenza) can cause these symptoms. if you are diagnosed with flu within 48 hours of onset you can be treated with an antiviral drug. however a cold virus or even severe pollen allergies also could cause the symptoms you describe. like i said you might have to wait and see what develops. meanwhile drink plenty of fluids get some rest and take some over-the-counter pain relievers (if you're not allergic to them). wishing you well!

Patient Question:
can childhood vaccines cause autism?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there has been ongoing controversy surrounding certain childhood vaccines and their relationship to autism. many studies have looked at whether there is a link between autism and vaccines. to date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism. a suspected link between the measles mumps rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism has been suggested by some parents of children with autism. typically symptoms of autism are first noted by parents as their child begins to have difficulty with delays in speaking after age 1. around this same time the mmr vaccine is first given to children. therefore autism cases with an apparent onset within a few weeks after the mmr vaccination may simply be an unrelated chance occurrence. parents have also questioned whether mercury-containing thimerosal (used as a preservative in vaccines) might cause autism. today with the exception of some influenza vaccines vaccines used in the united states to protect preschool-aged children contain reduced or no thimerosal as a preservative. (influenza vaccine is currently available both with thimerosal as a preservative and preservative-free. ) according to the cdc there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. more importantly studies have not found a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. because the exact cause of autism is not known parents may continue to have concerns despite the evidence. in these cases parents should be aware of the risks of serious disease in children who are not vaccinated. in some areas outbreaks of these dangerous diseases have occurred in people who have not been immunized. understanding the ruling on autism-like symptoms and vaccines in a recent controversy a georgia girl was entitled to compensation after developing autism-like symptoms after receiving five childhood vaccines in 2000. but what does this decision mean to your child and to other children? it's important to note that the government has not said that childhood vaccines actually cause autism. rather the division of vaccine injury compensation (dvic) at the department of health and human services agreed there is a possibility that the vaccines aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder in this young girl. the mitochondrial disorder manifested as a regressive neurological disease with some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. understandably many parents are worried about the risks that are feared to accompany vaccinations. ever since the first vaccines were developed there have been risks. most vaccine side effects are mild and severe ones are extremely rare. but the use of vaccines in children has essentially eradicated a number of major childhood diseases that kill. when parents fail to vaccinate their children the risk of serious -- even deadly -- disease epidemics extends beyond them and their families to their neighborhoods and communities. failure to vaccinate lays the foundation for new epidemics that could result in serious harm to your child. for instance a decline in vaccination rates in some european countries has led to fatal outbreaks of measles. in short whereas advocacy groups against childhood vaccines continue to take issue with immunizations cdc officials maintain that this recent ruling should not be generalized to the risk of vaccines for all children. in a statement the american academy of pediatrics reinforced its dedication to the health of all children and urges parents to fully immunize their children.

Actual Doctor's Response:
in the best case the treatment will achieve a sustained virological response (svr) which means that the hepatitis c virus is not detectable in the blood six months after treatment ends. an svr is the goal of treatment. although the virus is not eradicated its growth is suppressed. the chance of achieving an svr depends mostly on the genotype or strain of the virus. an svr is achieved in approximately 45% of patients with genotype one and between 65% and 75% of patients with genotype two or three. successful treatment should be followed by regular check-ups and a healthy lifestyle. although the overall prognosis for chronic hepatitis c is good some people will progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. a liver transplant may be an option but any replacement liver will also become infected with hepatitis c.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9809
the prognosis of viral hepatitis for most patients is good. symptoms of viral hepatitis such as fatigue poor appetite nausea and jaundice usually subside in several weeks to months without any specific treatment. in fact virtually all patients with acute infection with hepatitis a and most adults (greater than 95%) with acute hepatitis b recover completely. complete recovery from viral hepatitis means the hepatitis virus has been completely eliminated from the liver by the body's immune system. the inflammation in the liver subsides. the patient develops immunity to future infection with the same virus. the patient cannot transmit the infection to others. unfortunately not all patients with viral hepatitis infections recover completely. five percent of patients with acute hepatitis b infection and 80% of patients with acute hepatitis c infection develop chronic hepatitis. acute viral hepatitis needs no specific treatment. patients who develop chronic infection have chronic viral hepatitis and often need treatment to prevent further liver damage.

"ideally i'd like people to eat a healthy diet during chemotherapy so that they get enough vitamins and minerals " says christy russell md chair of the american cancer society breast cancer advisory committee. "any foods that get you through your treatment are probably ok. " you need to stay hydrated. dehydration can interfere with your treatment and has other risks. "if you don't drink enough fluids you can wind up in the emergency room " says carmen escalante md chair of the department of general internal medicine at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center. eating smaller meals more often than you used to may prevent nausea says escalante. although you should never force yourself to eat when you're nauseous russell says that it's important to eat regularly. "never come to get chemotherapy on an empty stomach " says russell. "it just raises the risks that you're going to feel queasy. "

a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d can help counteract the bone-damaging effects of corticosteroids. diet can also be helpful in combatting other drug side effects. for example a low-sodium diet can help reduce fluid retention and lower blood pressure which can be elevated with corticosteroid use. a diet high in folic acid such as found in leafy green vegetables fruits and fortified breads and cereals or a folic acid supplement is important if you are taking methotrexate (rheumatrex). for nausea caused by medications eat small frequent meals and foods that are easy to digest. try dry cereals breads and crackers. also avoid greasy spicy and acidic foods. if corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (motrin) or naproxen (naprosyn) cause stomach upset and irritation taking them with meals can help.

i have tried four different medications for depression. am i not giving these medications time to work? . each had side effects that caused me to stop taking them. should i continue to search for a new medication?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are 20 different meds you can try and sometimes it make sense to go until you find one that fits a bit better. you likely did not try them long enough and yes sometimes you get [the] worst first. but you have others you can try. psychotherapy has no side effects; ask to be referred to a psychologist for counseling perhaps.

Actual Doctor's Response:
better ways? no. if you truly have hypothyroidism thyroid hormone replacement is the best way to treat it. there are no rules in medicine that state that all of your symptoms must be related to your hypothyroidism so your doctor needs to look for other things that may be causing your array of symptoms. i am sorry to ask this but are you a female? i only ask because your tyroid gland affects everything in your body. ask your doctor to check your estrogen levels. i was the same as you until i seen my gynecologist. i am now in hormone replacement therapy and feel much better. i wake up feeling alive i don't feel like i'm walking in a fog all day. hope this helps. <positive_smiley>

Actual Doctor's Response:
unfortunately it's impossible to say what this is without a physical examination. i suggest you take the child to her pediatrician for an exam. it's possible what you're seeing is not so much an indentation as a bulging of the belly button that gives the impression of an indentation above the navel. this could indicate your granddaughter has an umbilical hernia. luckily these are not serious and may not even require treatment. however that's just a wild guess. you should have your granddaughter examined by her pediatrician to find out exactly what's going on. wishing you both all the best!

Actual Doctor's Response:
13 it’s a great question. the answer is the best doctors will do the right thing. those that aren’t quite at the top of the totem pole won’t. doctors are human beings. we come in all sizes and shapes different motivation. some are driven by excellence and some are driven by their bank accounts. but i would tell you that when you do your homework and you keep your eyes and ears open it kind of all sorts out. the patient who does the homework that asks the right questions that kind of sizes up the practice and acts like a smart consumer just like when you go to buy a car there’s sometimes that you just know you’re getting hustled the observant patient will sense that. how the questions are answered and who answers the questions by the way because some practices employ almost like sales people not physicians to do the what they call selling which is not appropriate in a professional practice in my opinion. this is not like buying an appliance. it is not like buying a car. this is a highly professional service. i think you need to spend time with a doctor not with someone who has no medical education and couldn’t even address those issues safety for example. so i think you need to get a sense of it. i think most people do. i think most people make the right decisions. unfortunately good decisions require work and the rich and famous don’t necessarily make the right decisions either. so it’s not a matter of money or how affluent you are or not being able to purchase because frankly most of the practices are affordable today they really are. for most working people you can afford it. you can finance it you can put it on credit card. but whatever it is that’s not the issue. the issue is making the right decision so that you’ll be happy and of course have a safe experience.

i think you get what you pay for in life and you get what you pay for in cosmetic surgeon’s office a consultation. i don’t think a free consultation is a good idea. first of all it implies that you don’t think it’s worth paying for. in other words if the patient doesn’t want to pay for service the patient should want to pay for service. it’s very important service because the answer may be that it’s not a good idea to have cosmetic surgery for x y and z reasons. and you’re going to get an honest opinion because you’re paying for the doctor’s time. otherwise often it’s kind of like a little bit of a come on frankly in some practices particularly practices that are high marketing high advertising more of a clinic different atmosphere than other practices. it makes it attractive to patients that say oh yeah it’s free what do i have to lose? but often they come in and then they are taken down a little road that they may not want to go to because sometimes there’s some pretty sophisticated marketing. by the way some of these clinics are owned by businessmen. doctors are employees. they just see this as another business and they hire a doctor just like a factory hires a line worker. so often it’s kind of a it’s a little bit unclear hang on a second… it’s an opening into what turns out to be too much of a slick operation. medical consultation should be professional and it shouldn’t be a hustle. it shouldn’t be slick and you shouldn’t feel pressured and sometimes people are. because frankly if everyone came in and consulted at no charge how could the clinic stay in business if it didn’t do surgery? now it’s now likely certainly a fair percentage need something but i think it’s healthier to pay for it. and frankly for many practices that $200 or $150 or whatever the number is they apply it to the procedure anyway if you’re comfortable or the doctor’s comfortable doing it so at least in that practice it really hasn’t cost you any more to consult. if you’re going to do consulting with 3 or 4 practices yes you could say wow $150 or $200 i’m going to be investing a fair amount of money but you know you’re also talking about a procedure that may be is thousands of dollars they are thousands most of the time certainly the bigger procedures like face lifting breast reduction tummy tucks it’s still a good investment because you’re going to learn. in my experience the practices that charge you for the consultation give you a lot more education. the practices that don’t charge you give you a lot more selling. but i don’t think you should be sold on this. i don’t think it’s something that you need to be drawn into. i think you have to approach it as a very very important consumer decision. it is your face it is your body even your health is on the line to a tiny tiny degree. so i think it is better to pay for the consultation. get free cosmetic surgery consultation - +91-9711-586-419.

Actual Doctor's Response:
a depressive type of bipolar disorder has a client who mainly exhibits depressive symptoms. loss of interest sleeping isolatation worthlessness and suicidal thoughts etc. another form would include more manic episodes which include rapid thoughts speaking spending. overlly cheerful optimistic may be mistaken for life of the party. manic phase can also be very productive periods for socially functioning people who are often highly intelligent motivated and don't want meiciation slowing them down. unfortunately highs for some can spike and crash into psychosis sometimes only sometimes violence. over spending into debt other impulse problems rocketing into severe depression. note; there are many varations on cyclic mood dysorders.

Patient Question:
what are shingles and postherpetic neuralgia?

Actual Doctor's Response:
shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus the virus that also causes chickenpox. in a person who has been exposed to chickenpox -- or its vaccine -- the virus never really goes away. it can lie dormant in the body's nerves. in most cases it stays that way. but in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. this is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. when it comes back the virus can cause shingles: a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. early shingles symptoms can include: headache light sensitivity flu-like symptoms without fever. itching tingling or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next and the pain can be moderate to severe. are you contagious? though people who haven't had chickenpox can catch that condition from you the shingles itself isn't contagious. for reasons that experts don't really understand the pain of shingles lingers for some. if the pain lasts for at least four months after the shingles rash appeared a person is diagnosed with phn. in some people the pain will subside. in others it won't. "we don't have any idea why the pain goes away in some people and not others " says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y. but the longer you have phn -- especially after a year -- the less likely it is to resolve he says.

wart remover products in the drugstore contain usually salicylic acid. i don't like the ones that have the freeze because it's not cold enough to really cause enough damage to kill the wart virus. and oftentimes it can leave a scar on the skin. so that would be done by your dermatologist using liquid nitrogen which is really really cold and will eliminate the skin where the wart virus lives and then the wart virus is gone. so it's important to note that wart virus is everywhere. anything you touch chances are you are being exposed to wart virus. so don't be so concerned about having it transmitted to somebody else if you shake hands that's not as much of a concern. it's more just to get rid of it because it's uncomfortable. also it doesn't go beyond the skin. so this is truly simply a condition of the skin. some people are more prone to it genetically than others and sometimes more at some ages than others. the treatments that contain salicylic acid work pretty well but they take time. another treatment that has great medical literature behind it that shows it works as well as the in-office treatments that we do as dermatologist is duct tape. so i think every house or apartment comes with duct tape. i haven't seen one house where it doesn't exist. i think it's just magically there when you buy a house it's just in your house. you cut it slightly bigger than the size of the wart and wash the skin dry it well and then put it on the skin and hold your hand to the outside to warm the glue to the skin so it sticks really well. it seems that the glue is toxic to that wart virus and the thickness of the tape suffocates it. then after three days you just peel that off and put a new one on. if you don't like the way that silver duct tape looks you can put a bandage over it and it works great for wart virus of the foot as well.

Actual Doctor's Response:
there can be several reasons. since i can't examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the ciprodex (there are several different types of "ear infections") it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason. one reason could be ear canal swelling. in otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut. some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate. other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris. many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will not go in. i would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last.

if symptoms are under control and medication regimens are adhered to there is very little chance that a person with schizophrenia will be a threat to themselves or others. moreover most people with schizophrenia are not particularly prone to violence with most preferring to be left alone. if someone with paranoid schizophrenia does become violent it is most often directed at a family member and usually occurs within the home. however people with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for suicide and attempt to take their life more frequently than the general population.

people with schizophrenia are not usually violent. in fact most violent crimes are not committed by people with schizophrenia. however some symptoms are associated with violence such as delusions of persecution. substance abuse may also increase the chance a person will become violent. if a person with schizophrenia becomes violent the violence is usually directed at family members and tends to take place at home. the risk of violence among people with schizophrenia is small. but people with the illness attempt suicide much more often than others. about 10 percent (especially young adult males) die by suicide. it is hard to predict which people with schizophrenia are prone to suicide. if you know someone who talks about or attempts suicide help him or her find professional help right away. people with schizophrenia are not usually violent.

you can take acetaminophen (tylenol others) for pain. you will want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin ibuprofen (advil motrin others) or naproxen (aleve). these are likely to make your symptoms worse for crohn's disease. i've had crohns' disease for 50 years. in those days the treatment for chrohns' was primitive. it was first diagnosed in 1942 the year i was borrn. i was in 2nd year medicine at the time & had to take a couple of years out before i could gat back. it was thought to be ulcerative colitis at the time & it was 12 years before we found that the small bowel was affected as well & i required at the time to have 6 ft. of my small bowel removed (no fun). now i can tell you that over the couinter drugs are useless in treating a flare-up. you need an anti-inflammatopry such as prednisone to battle the flare-up. anything less is useless. i advise you to go to your doctor & get a prescritption for prednisone. you start at 8 (5mg. ) tablets the first day. the next day take 7 then 6 etc. you'll probably find that the flare-up will be over in 4 or 5 days & you won't even finish the prescrption. one must be careful with drugs like prednisone; they are steroids & must be used with care. btw i once talked to dr. crohn in a conference call. he was 92 & living in connecticut. i'd strongly advise against taking nsaid's especially is she has ulcers because they can cause ulcers to bleed.

no it doesn't. colds are caused by a virus. despite what generations of mothers have said you cannot "catch your death of cold" simply by going outside in the cold while wet or sweaty. you catch colds by coming in contact with one of the more than 200 varieties of virus that can cause the symptoms of a common cold. usually rhinovirus is the culprit. you can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands frequently and refraining from touching your eyes or nose. it's not uncommon for a person to touch an object on which the virus has been deposited then transfer the virus from their fingertip to their body by rubbing their eye or picking their nose. hope this helps!

Patient Question:
what is this large hard dark lump under the skin of my inner thigh? it doesn't hurt but i've had it for like 3 months? . there's an oval hard lump under my skin on my inner thigh farther back so you can't see it if i'm standing it barely sticks out from my skin but is large like wide and long. the skin above its darker than the skin around it (pretty sure not dermatofibroma) i thoughtfrom shaving or my shorts were too tight &were irritating the skin but i've addressed these &it hasnt goneaway. it's too low to be a swollen lymph node. should it go away on its own time if i use neosporinor should i visit a dr.?

Actual Doctor's Response:
without the ability to examine this lump first-hand it would be impossible to blindly determine what it is. and it will go away on its own. a description is just not sufficient information to make this important call. yes you most definitely need to see a medical provider in order to get an accurate diagnosis.

yes i'm sure there is a rational explanation for this. the problem is you won't get that explanation unless you see a medical professional for a physical exam. before i jumped to a conclusion of multiple sclerosis (ms) i'd think in terms of less-scary explanations like a problem with a disc in your neck. that might account for the arm weakness. muscle twitching can be caused by several things including a mild potassium deficiency. is the toe twitching related to the arm weakness? maybe. maybe not. your primary health care provider is in the best position to start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together because he or she knows your medical history current medications and supplements and so on. i'd suggest you call and make an appointment to get the ball rolling toward a diagnosis. meanwhile i wouldn't get too worried about this being something scary like ms. we'll both hope it's something easily explained and easily treated. wishing you all the best!

assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery. yes i've done it

rogaine (topical minoxidil) and propecia (finasteride) are the only drugs approved by the fda to treat pattern baldness (hair loss as a result of hereditary causes). rogaine is a topical solution that is applied by directly rubbing it onto the scalp where hair growth is desired. only about 10% to 14% of the people who try this lotion experience hair growth. however rogaine lotion can help to slow hair loss. propecia is the first pill that can treat male pattern hair loss. like all prescription products it should be given under a doctor's care. while effective if treatment is discontinued results may not be maintained. permanent hair loss can also be treated by hair replacement procedures such as hair transplantation methods (like micro-grafting slit grafting punch grafting) and by scalp reduction. the type of hair loss as well as the patient's circumstances and desires determine which hair replacement procedures are most suitable.

i guess the safest advice to give you is to call your surgeon's office for some guidance. on the one hand the bruise-like mark on your lower abdomen doesn't surprise me after a laparoscopy. but the warmness in your legs sounds a bit unusual. in a laparoscopy procedure three small incisions are made in the abdomen. one of these cuts is in the belly button. because gravity will pull "old blood" (such as in a bruise) toward the feet that mark you see on your belly could simply be bruising related to the belly button incision. why your legs would feel warm is a mystery to me. when you speak to your surgeon or his or her nurse be prepared to tell him or her when the symptoms started. this will help them assess if the leg issue is related to the surgery or not. wishing you all the best!

Patient Question:
how do i prevent and cure scoliosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine. in most people the spine naturally curves out a bit near the neck and inward at the lower back (the lumbar region). in people with scoliosis the spine makes an abnormal "s" curve from side-to-side. scoliosis is usually identified in children. when adults get scoliosis it's frequently a result of trauma (accident) osteoporosis (thinning of the bones of the spine) or osteoarthritis. generally speaking it's not possible to prevent scoliosis. to prevent it you would need to know what is causing it. and usually we don't know the cause of scoliosis in a given individual (except as noted above). also there is no "cure" for scoliosis. when scoliosis is symptomatic (meaning it causes pain or problems breathing) it's often treated with a brace or occasionally surgery. if you think you or your child has scoliosis you should be examined by a health care professional. many people misunderstand what scoliosis is exactly and think poor posture or slouching indicate scoliosis when this may not be the case. hope this helps!

i don't believe that a personal choice to be celibate has any medical consequences. while humans are inherently sexual beings celibacy does not cause disease. it does require an strong conviction however. i've done a fair amount of non religious research on this and the answer is that the body will eventually get used to complete celibacy. after a while you might have a wet dream. even if you don't your sperm will eventually reabsorb into your body. you might get prostatits if you are used to having release and suddenly go down to nothing and epididymitis is also possible though less common. you also might find prostate fluid oozing out of you when you defaecate after a while. you do want to be clear in your reasons for doing this however. any time you do something that isn't natural like not ejaculating at all even if it isn't harmful you want to know why. if it's to please a partner for instance then make sure it pleases you too. otherwise resentment and other problems will build up. if it's because of guilt or shame issues have those taken care of you'll be happier and healthier. i'm not judging or presuming anything i just wanted to mention this as a friendly reminder.

Patient Question:
can a person go off high blood pressure medication if he looses weight or is this a lifetime medication once started?

Actual Doctor's Response:
when a person becomes overweight they make it harder for their heart to function. think about it: every pound of extra fat requires extra blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells. as your heart works extra-hard to pump blood through possibly miles of extra blood vessels it can cause high blood pressure. when a person who is overweight loses weight the opposite effect can occur. the fat and extra miles of blood vessels have gone away with the weight loss so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. this can lower blood pressure. so yes if a person is overweight and takes high blood pressure medication they may be able to get themselves off the meds by losing weight. i say "may" because factors other than extra weight may be causing the individual's hypertension problems. if you are overweight and taking medication for high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you begin a weight loss program. that way your healthcare provider can monitor your progress and adjust your medications as you lose weight. no one should ever stop taking a medication like one for high blood pressure on their own. that definitely could have bad consequences. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
this could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people. since your symptoms seem to improve when you're not at work and you've only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests i would suspect that anxiety could be the cause. it could also ironically be a side-effect from stopping (or starting) the birth control which can have physical side effects. you can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but i don't think you have too much to worry about.

the risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect does increase as the mother's age increases. this is probably due to abnormal division of the egg called nondisjunction. this leads to unequal chromosomes at the end of division. the traditional age at which a woman is considered to be at high risk for chromosomal abnormalities is 35. approximately 1 in 1 400 babies born from women in their 20s have down syndrome; it increases to about 1 in 100 babies born with down syndrome from women in their 40s.

Patient Question:
how do i know how much weight to lift?

Actual Doctor's Response:
when you first begin a strength training routine it’s always best that you start out with a much lower weight than you think necessary and progress until you reach an appropriate level. most people aim for 8-12 or 12-15 repetitions per set but don’t just stop your set because you reached some arbitrary number. it’s important to keep working your muscles until you reach muscular fatigue. if you find that you are doing an excessive amount of repetitions per set then it may be beneficial to increase the weight further to bring that number down to a more manageable number. if you’re doing too few repetitions consider decreasing the weight to bring the number up a bit since it may be too heavy of a weight for you. remember to always reevaluate what you’re doing while strength training. you want to be continually challenging yourself and progressing. try occasionally increasing the weight by small increments adding more repetitions to your set or adding more sets to your workout. if it might help some people will write down and keep a log of the weight number of sets and number of repetitions for each exercise that they do if you can’t recall off the top of your head. trial and error is the way to determine how much weight to lift. select a weight that looks close to what you think you can lift based on your goals. if general conditioning is your goal then select a weight you think you can lift eight to 12 reps (or 12-15 reps for beginners). if you can lift it 25 times with ease then it's too light and if you can lift it only four times then it's too heavy. there are no formulas to calculate this. simply decide what your goal is so you know how many reps to lift take a guess by looking at the weights and then give it a try. you'll get good at this quickly. find the ones you are most comfotable with the more comfortable you get the better they are

eat more! that’s what nearly all weight gain strategies come down to although it’s not always quite that simple. people with certain health conditions are at risk for poor nutrition: celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease cystic fibrosis cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection many others. people who are losing weight with these conditions should ask their doctor for a referral to a nutritionist. a low appetite is often part of the illness and eating higher-calorie foods is advised. some of these illnesses can also cause poor absorption of nutrients and testing and treatment can address this. in any medical condition if muscle mass has been lost it’s important to include protein in the diet to help rebuild muscles. healthy young men and teenage boys often want to gain weight usually in the form of muscle. their challenge is usually eating enough to keep up with the calories they’re burning in their active lifestyles. to gain weight by building muscle it’s necessary to eat a lot of protein. weight-training athletes may require 75 to 100 grams of protein or more daily. healthy lean protein sources include chicken eggs fish and beans. whey protein supplements can be mixed in with drinks soups or sauces. soy protein supplements are not advised except in small amounts because some of the soy may be converted to estrogen in the body. it’s best to talk to your doctor or a nutritionist before starting a high protein diet if you have any health conditions especially liver or kidney disease. gaining weight can be just as difficult as losing weight for some people. an essential component of weight gain is eating enough calories each day. a registered dietitian will be able to calculate and estimate your calorie needs using the harris-benedict equation or there are also websites available to help you do this on your own. in order to gain weight theoretically you need to eat more calories than what would normally be necessary for you to maintain your current weight. keep in mind it’s still important to eat healthy and make the right food choices. don’t use this as an excuse to eat whatever you want because you’ll end up gaining fat that way. you’ll need to exercise too especially by incorporating strength-building exercise which will help to build muscle mass to add to your weight. the surgeon general recommends at least two days per week of strength training exercising each major muscle group. of course the more exercise that you do the greater the benefits you should notice. keep in mind however that you do need rest to allow your muscles to recover. make sure that you’re getting enough protein in your diet as well. only protein has the essential amino acids necessary for muscle growth and development. a registered dietitian can also help you to determine your protein requirements. ask your doctor before taking protein supplements or beginning a high protein diet. i’ve recommended a good article for more information: <link>

what are other things you can do for acne?

Actual Doctor's Response:
cosmetics: don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted coverups or even foundation as long at it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). there are many quality products available. facials: while not absolutely essential steaming and "deep-cleaning" pores is useful both alone and in addition to medical treatment especially for people with "whiteheads" or "blackheads. " having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it yourself. pore strips: pharmacies now carry under a variety of brand names strips which you put on your nose forehead chin etc. to "pull out" oil from your pores. these are in effect a do-it-yourself facial. they are inexpensive safe and work reasonably well if used properly. toothpaste? one popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. there is no medical basis for this. ditto for vinegar.

think back to the three basic causes of acne and you can understand why the focus of both home treatment and prescription therapy is to (1) unclog pores (2) kill bacteria and (3) minimize oil. but first a word about. lifestyle: moderation and regularity are good things but not everyone can sleep eight hours eat three good meals and drink eight glasses of water a day. you can however still control your acne even if your routine is frantic and unpredictable. probably the most useful lifestyle changes you can make are to never to pick or squeeze pimples. playing with or popping pimples no matter how careful and clean you are nearly always makes bumps stay redder and bumpier longer. people often refer to redness as "scarring " but fortunately it usually isn't in the permanent sense. it's just a mark that takes months to fade if left entirely alone. open the pores cleansing and skin care: despite what you read in popular style and fashion magazines there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and situation. mild cleansers: washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid (for example dove neutrogena basis purpose and cetaphil are all inexpensive and popular) will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation. exfoliating cleansers and masques: a variety of mild scrubs exfoliants and masks can be used. these products contain either fine granules or salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a very mild peeling agent. these products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores. products containing glycolic or alpha hydroxy acids are also gentle skin exfoliants. retinol: not to be confused with the prescription medication retin-a this derivative of vitamin a can help promote skin peeling. kill the bacteria antibacterial cleansers: the most popular ingredient in over-the-counter antibacterial cleansers is benzoyl peroxide. topical (external) applications: these products come in the form of gels creams and lotions which are applied to the affected area. the active ingredients that kill surface bacteria include benzoyl peroxide sulfur and resorcinol. some brands promoted on the internet and cable tv (such as proactiv) are much more costly than identical products you can buy in the drugstore. benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of people which goes away as soon as you stop using the product. keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach so do not let products containing benzoyl peroxide leave unsightly blotching on colored clothes shirts towels and carpets. reduce the oil you cannot stop your oil glands from producing oil (unless you mess with your hormones or metabolism in ways you shouldn't). even isotretinoin (accutane see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they come back to life later. what you can do is to get rid of oil on the surface of the skin and reduce the embarrassing shine. use a gentle astringent/toner to wipe away oil. (there are many brands available in pharmacies as well as from manufacturers of cosmetic lines. ) products containing glycolic acid or one of the other alpha hydroxy acids are also mildly helpful in clearing the skin by causing the superficial layer of the skin to peel (exfoliate). masks containing sulfur and other ingredients draw out facial oil. antibacterial pads containing benzoyl peroxide have the additional benefit of helping you wipe away oil.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sadly yes. you can pass herpes type 1 or 2 to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout. when you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine (antiviral drugs) to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels. herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common. there is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively.

Patient Question:
how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?

Actual Doctor's Response:
first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic ("water pill") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called "loop diuretics"). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
whether you have diabetes or not here are some healthy cooking oils to choose from. choosing the right oil depends on what kind of fat the oil is made with. there are three kinds of fats: saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. saturated fats are butter lard and shortening. they are solid at room temperature and linked with elevated cholesterol levels and increased risk for heart disease. if you have diabetes these should be very limited. polyunsaturated fats are canola oil sunflower oil and walnut oil. they are always liquid even if placed in the fridge. these kinds of fats can improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. monounsaturated fats are olive oil and peanut oil. they are always liquid at room temperature but become semi-solid when placed in the refrigerator. when these are used in place of saturated fats they too can reduce the risk of heart disease. follow this link to find out what the top 3 oil picks are. canola

a sinus infection occurs when a pathogenic organism (virus bacterium or a fungus) grows within a sinus and causes intermittent blockage of the sinus ostium. drainage of mucus and pus often occur when the blockage is relieved. the drainage usually goes from the nasal passages to the throat or out the nostrils. such infections also cause inflammation (an influx of immune cells and swelling of the sinus tissue) of one or more sinuses. this adds to blocking the openings of the sinuses and causes discomfort. inflammation of the air cavities within the passages of the nose (paranasal sinuses) is referred to as sinusitis. sinusitis can be caused by infection but can also be caused by allergy and irritation of the sinuses. sinusitis is one of the more common conditions that can afflict people throughout their lives. sinusitis commonly occurs when environmental pollens irritate the nasal passages such as with hay fever. sinusitis can also result from irritants such as chemicals or the use and/or abuse of over-the-counter (otc) nasal sprays and illegal substances that may be snorted through the nose. about 30 million adults have "sinusitis.

Patient Question:
i'm in my late 50's and have implants. my right breast hurts when touched in one spot. should i be worried? . i have not had any injuries to my breast.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it can't hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure. while it's likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else. and that's why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain. as you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue. as time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to "pulling" on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself. and of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer. any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts. if you can't see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider. he or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
if this is truly your blood pressure (this actual reading would be very unusual since the top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic) is quite close together) yes i would be concerned. many blood pressure recording devices can give inaccurate readings so please take your blood pressure more often or better yet see a medical provider so that you can be properly evaluated.

continue to take your blood pressure on a regular basis at different times of day and in both arms. one isolated reading that is elevated is not as important as having several elevated readings. your medical provider will need to see your log of these home readings so please make an appointment. as far as your headache and tinnitus is concerned there can be a relationship but it will be up to a medical professional -- someone who can carefully examine you and look for other causes for these symptoms -- before an association is made.

Patient Question:
why am i always thirsty?

Actual Doctor's Response:
excessive thirst is hard to define. people normally drink varying amounts of liquid depending on their activity level and the temperature indoors and out. there are two main medical conditions that should be considered if you feel constantly thirsty: diabetes mellitus: the common form of diabetes in which high blood sugar levels spill into the urine increasing urine flow. the excessive urination leads to dehydration causing the person to become thirsty and drink more fluid. diabetes insipidus: an uncommon problem in which a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (adh) is either low absent or not functioning properly. adh normally acts on the kidneys to cause them to retain water. in diabetes insipidus the lack of normal adh function results in high urine flow a constant feeling of thirst and high fluid intake. your doctor can test you for these conditions over one or two office visits.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the only definitive treatment for a persistent bone spur would be surgery or at least a custom-made orthotic from a podiatrist. i am not sure what kind of steroids you are using (injections? ) but they will not cure a bone spurt. steroid injections can help the inflammation caused by the bone spurs but the effect is only temporary. steroids will not make a bone spur grow.

what are the symptoms of ringworm of the scalp or beard?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most commonly ringworm appears as one or more round or oval patches of baldness or scaly skin on the scalp or beard. typically the circular patches spread along their outer borders while clearing at the center which gives them a ringed appearance and the name " ringworm. " but you don't always see this pattern. other patterns include: patchy dandruff. scalp hair that breaks off at the surface resulting in a "black dot" appearance with mild to moderate dandruff. inflamed reddened crusty tender and swollen areas with small bumps that look like blisters. sometimes swollen lymph nodes and fever occur with ringworm infections. when fungal infections occur other areas of skin may develop a delayed allergic reaction in the form of a rash that looks like blisters known as an "id" reaction. id reactions from ringworm of the scalp usually appear on the face. early diagnosis and treatment of ringworm of the scalp or beard may stop the infection from becoming uncomfortable and prevent scarring and permanent hair loss. ringworm can be confused with other conditions with similar symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

the selection of a surgeon is really a complicated and somewhat daunting process today for many reasons. first of all medicine is becoming more and more specialized. there are more and more subdivisions within given specialties and within those subdivisions there even further subdivisions so you have to not only be in the right church you have to be in the right pew. you want to be in the right place. compounding it is the fact that there’s a little bit of blurring of specialty lines. one is not prohibited by law from migrating from one’s specialty into one of the 4 cosmetic surgery specialties. basically there are 4 recognized specialties that perform cosmetic surgery plastic surgery which is cosmetic surgery all over the body; head and neck surgeons who perform the cosmetic surgery only of the face and neck; dermatologists who perform skin peeling and other and liposuction and again procedures on the skin and then ophthalmologists these are eye specialists who further specialize just in the reconstructive and cosmetic surgery of the eyelids. so you have a lot of different participants in the delivery system and the question is how do you pick which one and that’s where you’ve got to do some homework. not every ophthalmologist for example has had additional training to be an excellent eyelid cosmetic surgeon and not every dermatologist has had the additional training or experience to be a world class chemical skin peeler to remove wrinkles. not every plastic surgeon is good at both breast augmentation and nose jobs which are operations in two different arenas. so you’ve got to be armed with questions so that you can ferret out who really is most appropriate and the answer comes with how specialized are you doctor? now in the world of cosmetic surgery if you have a choice between a plastic surgeon an ophthalmologist a dermatologist or a head and neck surgeon you need to find out what each of those doctors majors in. for example head and neck surgeon may major in nose jobs and do more nose jobs than say face lifts or eyelid surgery. on the other hand across the street is an ophthalmologist that does eyelid surgery exclusively. so if you needed to have an eyelid surgery example you’d be very well served by going to that eye surgeon who only does eyelids. maybe by some of the other doctors but you’d feel more comfortable being in the hands of the most specialized. so how do you ascertain that? you ask the doctor’s training and then you ask what i think is probably the key question that most people don’t ask. did you have a fellowship in cosmetic surgery? fellowships are the finishing school of the world of cosmetic surgery and by the way fellowships exist in other specialties. the fellowship is the practical training in a very narrow sphere of cosmetic surgery because cosmetic surgery is really a well defined world unto itself. it’s a limited number of procedures. it’s everything from face lifts and forehead lifts all the way to tummy tucks and breast surgery and necks in between. so my advice is to find the doctor that has trained the longest and strongest meaning that additional training and that’s voluntary and strong meaning they are very focused on what they do. the best most accomplished most talented surgeons the ones that you and i would like to go to typically are the ones that are the most specialized.

Patient Question:
how do the new mammogram screening guidelines benefit patients?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the primary benefit for reduced mammograms is fewer "false-positive" results. that is the mammogram suggests a worrisome finding when there really isn't one. there are more frequent false positives among younger women (age less than 50). younger women have both more dense breast tissue (making mammograms more difficult to interpret) and less risk overall for breast cancer (risk rises with age). false positives often lead to unneeded biopsies. it should also be noted that 10% to 15% of breast cancers in this younger group are missed by mammograms.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9655
the gravest risk for less breast screening tests would be development of an advanced stage breast cancer. breast cancer is the most common gynecological cancer. its incidence is 135 in 100 000 women. its mortality rate is 27 per 100 000 women. compare this to cervical cancer where the incidence is 9. 3 per 100 000 women with a mortality of 2. 9. it's no wonder that women feel vulnerable about breast cancers. in a brand new meta-analysis the assertion that screening mammograms saves lives has been reaffirmed. currently 1 904 women in their 40s would have to be screened to extend the life of one woman. among women in their 50s 1 339 women would need to be screened to extend the life of one woman. the statistical risk reduction for the two age groups is 15% and 14%. the reason the "50 somethings" have been given the green light for routine mammograms is that they are at greater risk because of advancing age. it is this point which is the most heavily debated. is it not worth it to save the life of one woman by having to screen 565 more women? most women have a personal connection to one or more women who have had cancer diagnosed at an early age by a mammogram.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi after doing some research for you found this on acog. org. pregnancy is not likely after ablation but it can happen. if it does the risk of miscarriage and other problems are greatly increased. if a woman still wants to become pregnant she should not have this procedure. women who have endometrial ablation should use birth control until after menopause. sterilization may be a good option to prevent pregnancy after ablation. a woman who has had ablation still has all her reproductive organs. routine cervical cancer screening and pelvic exams are still needed. the problem with condoms is the can break this will increase the chance of getting pregnant which as you have read is not good for you. so its toss a coin time who goes for the op would be best as i can see and makes sense. hope this helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
took a dose of 50mcg levothyroxine can this cause harm? . should i be concerned since it is a natural hormone produced? effects if any it may cause?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of "natural supplement" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single 50mcg dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information.

its probably too late as of this time but yes it can. i am anaphylaxis to penicillin and ended up in the hospital after my husband was taking amoxicillin and we had sex. the reaction for me was immediate but it took me until my throat was closing to convince the e. r doctor that this was the problem. he later asked me to sign a consent form to get my hospital records where i spent 3 days on a respirator from my first encounter with penicillin so he could write an article for a medical journal. be careful in the future.

Patient Question:
are dentures worn 24 hours a day?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your dentist or prosthodontist will instruct you as to how long to wear your denture and when to remove it. during the first several days after receiving your denture you may be asked to wear it all the time including while you sleep. although this may be temporarily uncomfortable it is the quickest way to identify the areas on your denture that may need adjustment. once adjustments are made you should remove your dentures before going to bed. this allows gum tissues to rest and allows normal stimulation and cleansing by the tongue and saliva. the denture can be put back in your mouth in the morning.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9526
the denture development process takes about three weeks to 1. 5 months and several appointments. once your dentist or prosthodontist (a dentist who specializes in the restoration and replacement of teeth) determines what type of appliance is best for you the general steps are to: make a series of impressions of your jaw and take measurements of how your jaws relate to one another and how much space is between them. create models wax forms and/or plastic patterns in the exact shape and position of the denture to be made. you will "try in" this model several times and the denture will be assessed for color shape and fit before the final denture is cast. cast a final denture adjustments will be made as necessary

the short answer is this: yes you should see a doctor. you could have a cyst a lipoma or something else. your best bet is to have this examined by an appropriate health care provider such as a dermatologist though you can simply go see your primary care provider if necessary. unfortunately we can't diagnose a skin lesion like this via the internet. and if it's an infected cyst or something you'll need to have it drained because it won't clear up on its own. best to you! a board certified dermatologist like dr. eric schweiger can help you with that. it will be better if you seek help from professionals who can help you with that particular concern of yours. it is very important that you do an action now to know the cause and get rid of that skin problem. clear clinic - <link> you may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours. dr. eric schweiger is a member of the american academy of dermatology and the american society for dermatologic surgery. he may help you with that. best dermatologist nyc - <link> you may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours. dr. eric schweiger a board certified dermatologist may help you with that. clear clinic - <link>

Patient Question:
i love oatmeal and i am a diabetic. is it good to eat in a regular basis? . the issue is that i read that some doctors say that oatmeal is alright but you must be careful with it as a major part of your diet but others say it is fine as long as it is not loaded up with all the "nice" things that make oatmeal so good like brown sugar and raisans which makes sense because of the high carbo content.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer the key for diabetes is keeping carbohydrate intake consistent throughout the day. oatmeal is a healthy carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for heart health and can fit in a healthy diet. you want to work with your healthcare provider on how many carbohydrates you need in a day. the american diabetes association recommends 45-60 grams of carbohydrate at a meal (3-4 carbohydrate servings). one half cup of oatmeal without added sugars contains about one carbohydrate serving (15 grams). if you add to tablespoons raisins that is another carbohydrate serving. the benefit of carbohydrate counting is you have flexibility about what you eat as long as you stay within your recommended carbohydrate intake. but choosing carbohydrates that are nutritous like oatmeal (and other whole grains) fruits and dairy is important for a healthy diet. if you need help see a diabetes educator for more assistance. for more information on carb counting see this article <link> i am a type 2diabetic and eat oats every morning. one of the first things i was taught was to add a good fat or protein to a carb breakfast. i eat 1/3rd cup of steel cut organic oats cooked in water 6 oz. of almond milk 1tsp cinnimon and 1 tbs. of almond butter. i also eat one cup of fruit but eat the fruit 1hr prior to the oats. this wait time allows the fruit to digest before the oats start to digest. i have been taught also to not eat a startch or grain carb together with a fruit as the stomach treats this combination by frementation during digestion. my blood sugars are norml eating this way. total carbs for this meal is around 66grams which is high but eating this way negates the high blood sugars!

your best bet is to speak with your pharmacist about possible interactions between your medications and foods or beverages. i don't know about the combination of milk and phentermine but i do know that caffeine of any kind (colas chocolate) can increase the side effects of phentermine. often people take either phentermine or diethylpropion not both at the same time. if this is the regimen your health care provider prescribed then he or she must have determined this is safe for you. however if (for example) you previously were taking one of those medications and then your health care provider switched you to the other but you decided to take both please consult your health care provider as soon as possible. hope this helps!

if you were diagnosed with strep on monday and then started on antibiotics i doubt that you have spread it to your eyes. you could be allergic to the antibiotic that your doctor gave you but you would know whether or not you are allergic if you have been on any antibiotics in the past. if so then the eye problem i believe is a separate thing altogether. go and call your doctor back and let them know of when your eyes started itching and oozing. i am not sure of the antibiotics and whether or not they will help your eyes and your eyes should not be oozing anything and especially something green. i would have called my doctor back and then go to the emergency room because the longer you wait you might have damaged your eyes. penicillin is a good antibiotic but as far as the oozing out of your eyes it may not be the right one. so please call your doctor and let them know and see what they say. i do hope you get to feeling better. please keep us informed of your situation. and please let us know if you can help in anyway. thank you.

Actual Doctor's Response:
waiting a few days makes sense. a few extra days of employing home remedies should not increase your chances of a complication occurring. i suggest drinking plenty of fluids frequent gargling use throat lozenges to soothe a sore throat sleep with a humidifier and take otc analgesics for discomfort. here are a few additional points: - eventually i recommend that you talk w/your physician about the allergy to penicillin. many folks mistakenly think that they are allergic to penicillin when in actually they were never allergic to this agent or the allergy has worn off. i remember reading that only 20% of individuals with a verified penicillin allergy continued to have a negative reaction after the passage of 10 years from the last dosage taken; - years ago doctors would culture the throat & would have to wait days for sensitivity results in determining if a patient had strep throat and the appropriate antibiotic that would be needed. today in the physician's office a patient can know the results through a swab of the throat and a 10 minute wait period. it may be a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor or medical clinic. that way your throat can be viewed by a medical professional a diagnostic determination probably made on the spot and you can discuss the possibly that you may not be allergic to penicillin. feel better soon.

it depends on what she considers a "partial" hysterectomy. if she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero. based on the detail of this story i would seriously doubt its validity. another question the person who presented me the story is very distraught over his gf losing this baby they even named her. he was not present for any appts has not seen any labs or ultrasound pic even though she states she had an ultrasound and has seen no positive pregnancy test basically he is going on her word. i hate seeing him hurting like this and the circumstances surrounding are very suspicious. he says she has 2 small incisions one by her bellybutton and one on her left side. is there medical documentation or anything he could ask for to prove her story?

while the chance of pregnancy is small it is not "zero". semen that is excreted during sexual excitation can be loaded with viable sperm. there is no way to calculate your "chances" of getting your girlfriend pregnant by this risky sex play so you will need to sweat it out. she could take a "morning after" pill or you can just wait until she has (or misses) her next period. take this experience as a serious lesson. use a condom. your girlfriend should be on some sort of birth control. and. you should not be engaging in sexual activity that could end up with an unintentional pregnancy. hi very slight and you also have to take into account the it takes 3 days for male sperm to reach the egg and a female egg is only fertile for 2 days. so if the day was her ovulation day then any sperm would be a day late in getting there. and why did you not think of plan b as a back up plan? does this help. good luck hi very slight and you also have to take into account the it takes 3 days for male sperm to reach the egg and a female egg is only fertile for 2 days. so if the day was her ovulation day then any sperm would be a day late in getting there. and why did you not think of plan b as a back up plan? does this help. good luck

Patient Question:
post stent lifestyle reccomendations none have been given to me. after having two stents implanted i was put on appropriate meds as to my individual situation but was never informed as to what lifestyle changes i should do to lessen the chances of further complications i. e. diet exersise etc. is this normal these days?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the whole idea of having heart stents done is to allow you to lead a full and active life. it is very common for patients who have had heart surgery to be afraid to engage in normal activities. one excellent way to get back into an exercise program is through cardiac rehabilitation. cardiac rehab as it is often called is a customized program of exercise and education. many programs involve not only monitored exercise but also provide nutritional counseling emotional support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems. if cardiac rehab is not appropriate or possible then discuss your specific exercise goals with your doctor. physical activity is so important for your wellbeing. a physical exercise program should incorporate 4 basic types of exercises. the exercises should include: aerobic exercise muscle strengthening flexibility and balance. an adult should spend at least 30 minutes in aerobic exercise on five or more days of the week. but this is a minimum amount and more is definitely better. the good news is that is doesn’t have to be done all at once. three 10 minute walks are just as good as one 30 minutes walk. depending on your other health issues you will want to pick an aerobic exercise that doesn’t cause problems elsewhere in your body such as your joints. that is why swimming bike riding and walking work better for many adults rather than running. weight lifting is another important part of an exercise program. woman especially benefit by weight training in maintaining strong bones. yoga is a wonderful way to work on flexibility and balance. yoga not only helps with these elements it can reduce your stress levels. but research has shown that exercising alone can’t wipe out the damage done if you sit all day long. humans were not designed to be as sedentary as modern life now dictates. it is important to move throughout the day to be really healthy. obviously diet and weight are also key elements in your recovery from cardiac stent surgery. consulting with a dietician is very helpful in learning to eat healthy. keeping a diary of all the foods that you eat for 3 days or more can also be enlightening. taking off those extra pounds if you are overweight and watching your cholesterol intake needs to be on your program. we know from research studies on obese patients who were at risk for diabetes that losing 5% to 7% of their total body weight delayed and possibly prevented diabetes. diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease as is high blood pressure and small amounts of weight loss can significantly improve your health. you don’t have to look like a model to be healthy. so ask your doctor for specific recommendations to help you on your way to a healthier lifestyle.

i certainly do not know enough about you or your case to pronounce you "well" and free of all cardiac disease. if you are worried about the status of your heart see a cardiologist and have an ecg taken on a treadmill. if the cardiologist pronounces you heart-healthy then you can be assured that all is well.

Patient Question:
what is the first trimester (week 1 - week 12) of pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
during the first trimester your body undergoes many changes. hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. these changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. other changes may include: extreme tiredness. tender swollen breasts. your nipples might also stick out. upset stomach with or without throwing up (morning sickness). cravings or distaste for certain foods. mood swings. constipation (trouble having bowel movements). need to pass urine more often. headache. heartburn. weight gain or loss. as your body changes you might need to make changes to your daily routine such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent small meals. fortunately most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. and some women might not feel any discomfort at all! if you have been pregnant before you might feel differently this time around. just as each woman is different so is each pregnancy.

you're in the home stretch! some of the same discomforts you had in your second trimester will continue. plus many women find breathing difficult and notice they have to go to the bathroom even more often. this is because the baby is getting bigger and it is putting more pressure on your organs. don't worry your baby is fine and these problems will lessen once you give birth. some new body changes you might notice in the third trimester include: shortness of breath. heartburn. swelling of the ankles fingers and face. (if you notice any sudden or extreme swelling or if you gain a lot of weight really quickly call your doctor right away. this could be a sign of preeclampsia. ) hemorrhoids. tender breasts which may leak a watery pre-milk called colostrum (kuh-loss-struhm). your belly button may stick out. trouble sleeping. the baby "dropping" or moving lower in your abdomen. contractions which can be a sign of real or false labor. as you near your due date your cervix becomes thinner and softer (called effacing). this is a normal natural process that helps the birth canal (vagina) to open during the birthing process. your doctor will check your progress with a vaginal exam as you near your due date. get excited — the final countdown has begun!

could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy? . this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat. but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position. in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease (<link> <link> ). can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you disrupted the skin by trying to squeeze a presumed mole out of the tissue there really is no way to make it go back in. i suggest you keep an eye on this to make sure you don't now develop a skin infection. if you experience localized redness heat swelling or pain or if you develop a fever you should seek medical attention. for future reference it's not a good idea to try to remove skin lesions yourself. never pop pimples "dig out" lesions with a knife or squeeze growths on the skin. for one thing you don't necessarily know for sure what they are. for example what you think is a mole could be a skin cancer. pulling it out of the skin could appear to remove the lesion but cancerous cells not visible to the naked eye could remain behind and delay your getting treatment. hope this helps!

Patient Question:
what causes bleeding in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy?

Actual Doctor's Response:
abnormal bleeding in late pregnancy may be more serious because it can signal a problem with the mother or baby. call your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any bleeding in your second or third trimester. possible causes of bleeding in late pregnancy include: placenta previa. this condition occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the opening of the birth canal. although placenta previa is very rare occurring in only one in 200 pregnancies it is an emergency requiring immediate medical attention. bleeding from placenta previa can often occur without any pain. placental abruption. in about 1% of pregnancies the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during labor and blood pools between the placenta and uterus. placental abruption can be very dangerous to both the mother and baby. other symptoms of placental abruption are abdominal pain clots from the vagina tender uterus and back pain. uterine rupture. in rare cases a scar from a previous c-section can tear open during pregnancy. uterine rupture can be life-threatening and requires an emergency c-section. other symptoms of uterine rupture are pain and tenderness in the abdomen. vasa previa. in this very rare condition the developing baby's blood vessels in the umbilical cord or placenta cross the opening to the birth canal. vasa previa can be very dangerous to the baby because the blood vessels can tear open causing the baby to bleed severely and lose oxygen. other symptoms of vasa previa include abnormal fetal heart rate and excessive bleeding. premature labor. vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy may just be a sign that your body is getting ready to deliver. a few days or weeks before labor begins the mucus plug that covers the opening of the uterus will pass out of the vagina and it will usually have small amounts of blood in it (this is known as "bloody show"). if bleeding and symptoms of labor begin before the 37th week of pregnancy contact your doctor right away because you might be in preterm labor. other symptoms of preterm labor include contractions vaginal discharge abdominal pressure and ache in the lower back. additional causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are: injury to the cervix or vagina polyps cancer.

Actual Doctor's Response:
penile pumps and there’s mechanical devices that you can use those are all good for erection. and they work great. before the days of viagra that was a common operation if a guy had diabetes or a prior pelvic surgery and he couldn’t get an erection and injections didn’t work we had amazing results with penile implants whether inflatable or mechanical. and almost all the men who had those implants were thrilled with them. in the old days you had about one out of a hundred would break and you’d have to go back and fix it. either the pump would go bad or a line would erode or something would go wrong or leak. the newer advances in products are so much better. they not only increase they not only fill length but fill girth and they are far more reliable with rare risks of complications. but with the advent of these new medications out now most men don’t need that. there’s still a need for it and there’s still experts around the world that specialize in that and get great results. but that doesn’t change the length or the width of the penis. it just simply restores the ability for rigidity.

saphris (asenapine) is fda approved to treat acute mania from bipolar disorder or the symptoms of schizophrenia. it is a drug that is placed under the tongue and not swallowed directly. you ask how it works. by blocking one type of dopamine receptor it stops the above disorders. it blocks a serotonin receptor which is counter intuitive but this blocking may help increase other chemicals that help depression (dopamine norepinephrine). in other parts of the brain. it is also my understanding that it shares chemical properties with a well-known antidepressant called remeron/mirtazapine. many of these meds for schizophrenia have been used for treating depression and some have been fda approved recently (abilify and seroquel xr).

Actual Doctor's Response:
the symptoms also resemble gallbladder kidney or bladder stones; however these should have already been ruled out with a cat scan. my mother (diabetic) experienced something as that which lasted quiet awhile she lost a significant amount of weight during her sickness. doctors were also stunned and diagnosed something as gastritis. researching the web of her symptoms i found that she was probably experiencing an inflammation of the outer lining of her stomach. she was given antibiotics from her doctor which was appropriate however i advised a change in diet until better. her symptoms lasted for several months. the nausea prevented her from eating as she should resulting in a unhealthy weak appearance. there was significant sporadic work loss during that time. antibiotics were prescribed at least twice as i remember. the one thing i have learned of the medical field is that they are forever making mistakes and usually it is good to rely on your own thoughts and those of family and friends. never ever hesitate to get a second or third opinion. if your doctor is located in a small town seek out a professional in the closest large city as the state capital or one of it's size. it seems the most knowledgeable and creative doctors practice in larger cities. one last thought. not knowing more information the thought of an appendix problem popped to mind.

Patient Question:
what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.

oxycontin is an opiate (derived from the opium plant). morphine is an opiate as well. the test that you took may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between these two opioid compounds. i have read in other sites that these 2 medications have the same properties. oxy often shows up as morphine. i am very lucky that my dr. told me that the test that they are made to do in the dr. office are often incorrect. if my dr. is knows the patient well he will not dismiss someone based on the urine test. these often show up as other drugs. good luck.

hi princess well anal sex and getting pregnant an outside chance but very outside only if after you dribbled sperm over you vagina. two things its either your body was put off but you having anal sex if it was the first time there's nothing wrong with having anal sex lots of women love it as it still give them orgasms. or your just having a missed period it does happens. could be stress if you exercise could be from that lost any weight could be from that as well. but if your still worried do a hpt (home pregnancy test). but why cant you see your doctor on your own what is said between you and him/her stays that way being your now 18. hope this helps. good luck

Patient Question:
lortab makes my stomach hurt and me itch. percocet didn't give me the same problems. what is the difference?

Actual Doctor's Response:
lorcet contains a different pain medication than percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the lorcet. stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food (more of a meal rather than some crackers). i would suggest that you talk to your health care provider about your reaction to lorcet and also let your pharmacist know. they can put a note in your profile about this reaction.

it is not recommended that you apply ice to a burn because the ice can stick to the skin and do additional damage. you do not want to puncture the blister because that could bring on an infection. continue to watch it and for the pain you can try taking an acetaminophen product like tylenol. if it continues to get worse you will need to see a health care provider.

Patient Question:
does being hungry all the time subside after a month or two of being pregnant?

Actual Doctor's Response:
while everybody is different that constant hunger that occurs the first few months of pregnancy usually subsides by the second trimester. while appetite is still robust the second trimester it can be satisfied with balanced meals and regular intervals of eating. typically by the end of the third and last trimester appetite decreases as the baby tends to push on the stomach causing early fullness. for more on eating right during pregnancy see this webmd article. congratulations on your pregnancy!

Patient Question:
can chiropractic care reverse osteoporosis or scoliosis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer in my opinion chiropractic adjustments will have little or no curative effect on either of these conditions. a child or teenager with scoliosis should be carefully evaluated and monitored by a specialist. a person with osteoporosis should be under the care of her primary care medical provider or orthopedist. this is kind of a "loaded" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find "specialists" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that.

Patient Question:
how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis. x-rays of the affected joints can suggest osteoarthritis. the common x-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones and bone spur formation. simple x-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist in decision making as to when surgical intervention should be considered. arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. during arthrocentesis a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout infection and other causes of arthritis. removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain swelling and inflammation. arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. if successful patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. finally a careful analysis of the location duration and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. therefore the presence of heberden's nodes bouchard's nodes and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

osteoarthritis can occur in any joint. it occurs most often in the hands knees hips and spine. warning signs of osteoarthritis are: stiffness in a joint after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time swelling or tenderness in one or more joints a crunching feeling or the sound of bone rubbing on bone. no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use several methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other problems: medical history physical exam x-rays other tests such as blood tests or exams of the fluid in the joints.

i used to smoke a similar amount and would often get pains in my chest on a morning sometimes lasting for a couple of hours. i used to worry about them quite a lot so i quit smoking to see if it would relieve them. the first couple of weeks after quitting the pains got worse but then stopped completely. i've never experienced them since. i'm not a doctor though so i can't say that you are experiencing the same thing as me. but it certainly sounds similar

Patient Question:
i have all the symptoms of hypothyrodisim and it runs in my family but i also have very tender breasts. is that normal? . they hurt most of the time. i also do have a lump were my thyroid gland is.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldn't be a bad idea to get checked out. if you do have hypothyroidism you should be treated for it. breast tenderness generally isn't considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances. some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or menopause and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time. so it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they aren't necessarily in a clinical sense. your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland. hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better. best to you!

Patient Question:
what is delirium?

Actual Doctor's Response:
delirium is a form of altered consciousness that occurs in people with medical illnesses or who have dementia. in delirium the person’s level of consciousness and understanding of her surroundings rises and falls. she may be lucid and appropriate for part of the day but be confused and disoriented at other times. people who are delirious may be lethargic and “out of it ” agitated and aggressive or somewhere in between. delirium most often affects older adults and children. infections and medications are probably the most common causes of delirium. people with dementia are more likely to become delirious. treating the underlying cause (such as an infection) is the most important treatment for delirium. antipsychotic medications can be used to treat delirium. re-orienting and comforting a delirious person is also often helpful and may reduce the need for antipsychotic medication.

a lack of iron can cause anemia and iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. this is because iron is major component of hemoglobin and is essential for its proper function. chronic blood loss for any reason is the main cause of low iron levels in the body as it can deplete its iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of blood. anemia that is due to low iron levels is called iron deficiency anemia. women are more likely than men to have iron deficiency anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal menstruation. this is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary. iron deficiency anemia can also be due to small repeated instances of blood loss for instance from colon cancer or from stomach ulcers. stomach ulcer bleeding may be induced by medications even by very common over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (advil motrin). in infants and young children iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a diet lacking in iron. a doctor's interpretation of complete blood count (cbc) results may give clues to suggest this type of anemia. for instance iron deficiency anemia usually occurs with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.

Actual Doctor's Response:
as you may know the internet poses an obvious barrier when trying to make a blind diagnostic decision without the ability to examine your toe first-hand. i have removed zillions of toenails in my medical career and yes you can have some areas under the remaining nail turn brownish. this is usually older blood that is being reabsorbed by the body. if your toe is red hot and tender then these would be a sign of an infection. when in doubt it is perfectly fine to contact the medical provider that performed this procedure for post-surgical advice.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i agree with your doctor. herpes simplex (cold sores) are typically only contagious and transmitted during a active outbreak. since millions of people on this planet have latent herpes virus in their system those children will be eventually exposed by someone. a classmate or day-care cohort. most likely sometime in their lives. should they get it it will not likely be from a loving grandmother who just wants to kiss her grandchildren. new parents are worried about everything but this is one virus that is unlikely to come from you. about 50% of the people who get one cold sore will never get another the rest of their lives so should we advise they never to kiss another person? most people like you can have periodic outbreaks but the infrequency of your events show that you have an excellent immune system that is suppressing this virus. my advice for you is to kiss those grandchildren when you do not have an outbreak and my advice for your daughter is to "get real". a grandmother's love cures more boo-boos and i suspect your kisses will be risk-free.

your unimmunized child is at risk for measles in any crowd not just disneyland or disney world. she will likely be fine if you do not allow anyone to touch her in the stroller or play with other children. kids like to touch things so if you allow her to touch benches handles etc. places where other children have touched you need to carefully wash or sanitize her hands. you can also wait for disney world until the recent measles epidemic has abated but as far as i know most of the cases are in california (disneyland) not in florida. i don't know when you are planning this trip but you can always check with the local health authorities to see if there are any restrictions or recommendations at the time.

Actual Doctor's Response:
federal employees are not eligible for cobra benefits but they are eligible for a benefit that functions similarly called temporary continuation of coverage (tcc). as is the case with cobra you will be able to continue her current health benefits for up to 18 months (assuming you're leaving voluntarily. involuntary separation from a federal job generally disqualifies you from being tcc eligible). you'll be responsible for paying the full cost of your health plan (your portion and the government's) plus a 2% administrative fee. you can see what those rates will amount to by checking the health premiums page on the u. s. office of personnel management website. to get the ball rolling you will need to fill out and submit to your human resources office a form (2809) for tcc enrollment. you can find the form at: www. opm. gov. you should submit paper work within 31 days from your final day of work but no later than 60 days after your job ends. if you miss the deadline you'll miss out on the opportunity to elect tcc. it's important to note that there is a 31-day extension period after your final day of work when health benefits will still be available to you at no cost. on the 32nd day after regular coverage comes to an end you'll have to begin paying your premium.

unfortunately the answer to this question is yes. as of right now if you apply for insurance on the private market (as opposed to getting it through your job) insurance companies will look into your medical history and can deny you coverage based on what they find. in some instances you may be extended a plan in spite of a pre-existing health condition but will be charged more for it. as of january 2014 however the affordable care act (the health reform law) will prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage on the basis of their medical history. in addition carriers won't be allowed to charge people different rates for health insurance because of their health status or gender. if you've shopped for health insurance on the private market and have been denied coverage don't give up just yet. some minor health issues (think well-controlled asthma migraines etc. but not diabetes or heart disease however) won't be declined by every insurance company.

i certainly think you should see a doctor about this. what you're describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass. this possibly could cause a bowel obstruction eventually. it sounds like you've done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives. you should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay well-hydrated. some medications for acid reflux can cause constipation so be aware of that. your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if there's something else going on. either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements. best wishes to you! i have not experienced what you are going through. but i did have anal fissures leading to bleeding. also hard stools. here is what worked for me: i have boiled okra regularly for dinner as part of my diet. spinach (indian recipie for plain palak) 1 apple a day dried prunes in office for munching (about 5 to 6). atleast two liters of water every day almond oil with warm(or hot for me) milk after dinner. and important: walking 30 mins a day if possible before the first visit to the toilet int he morning. i never buy ebooks but i bought this one and some of them helped me: <link> ebook pdf is called: constipation help i'm not saying this will cure your condition which looks a bit further away from where i was. but these things in my diet helped me. from what i experienced once you have this situation its better to see what foods you eat and make a regular schedule. disclaimer: i only told what i faced and how it helped me. im not a docotr and have no medical knowledge. i also cut out coffee entirely from my diet. hotchoclate. for me. those led to hard stools

i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these distressing symptoms. being a woman is rarely easy! when you say you had a "partial hysterectomy " i'm not sure exactly how to interpret that. the term "hysterectomy" refers to removal of the uterus only. however many women use the term to mean they had their uterus and their ovaries removed. are you saying you had your uterus removed but retained one or both ovaries? i'm going to go with that interpretation. at age 45 you could indeed be entering menopause. it's a little early but not unheard of. having had your uterus removed shouldn't really affect how well your ovaries function. maybe they're just starting to wind down naturally. your best bet is to see a gynecologist. he or she can assess whether or not you're in perimenopause. if you are there are certain things you will want to know such as how menopause affects vaginal tissue. you may also want to decide whether or not to go on hormone replacement therapy. of course there could be other causes for your symptoms. a sluggish thyroid comes to mind. we women tend to attribute all our mood changes to estrogen levels but that's not valid. many other hormones can affect the way we feel physically and emotionally. it would be good to get a workup from a medical professional to find out what's really going on. wishing you well!

there is a problem and it would be helpful to know if you are male or female. but with that said you need to go to student health or your primary care medical provider for a urinalysis and perhaps a blood sugar test. in females urethritis or a urinary tract infection is high on the list. in males one needs to think about prostatitis. for both diabetes needs to be considered (especially if you are having a desire to drink all of the time as well). there are many other causes of course but the internet poses some significant barriers when it comes to making accurate blind diagnoses. you need to see a medical provider now. don't wait any more time.

how can i overcome feeling so nervous when i play my flute in band? . there's this one song that we play in band and the flutes have a huge solo in it where we're the only ones with the melody. everytime i even. think. about playing that part in the song i flip out. when we play it in band i shake so bad my notes come out shaky i get sweaty my heart beats very fast and i can barely play because i am so nervous. this happens all the time even if it's just a really short section of playing. last time we played it i got so nervous i almot got up and walked away.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. stage fright can be a terrible thing! first i want to point out that even though you feel extremely anxious the fact is you are playing the song. sure your notes might be a bit shaky -- but you're probably the only person who notices that. you should give yourself a pat on the back for getting through the performance and have confidence in your ability to do this. if it helps at all please know that many famous performers confess to having stage fright. in fact the hugely successful singer adele recently said she often feels "scared (i'm) not going to be able to deliver. " i doubt your performance anxiety requires medical treatment. if possible talk to your music teacher or your fellow performers about this. i bet you'll find they also feel nervous about performing. sometimes just knowing you're not alone is helpful. best wishes to you and remember you can do it!

that's up to your oral surgeon. as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (nsaid) medication naproxyn can cause bleeding. some dentists don't want their patients taking a "blood thinner" after an extraction. other dentists don't seem to care if you do or not. your oral surgeon should have given you written discharge instructions that explained what you should and should not take for pain after the extraction. if you did not receive such instructions call the office. in the meantime you can take acetaminophen (tylenol) which is not a "blood thinner. " (that's assuming you're not allergic to acetaminophen. ) be careful not to exceed the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen as doing so can cause severe health consequences. you also can apply ice packs to your face for comfort care. wishing you well!

pepto-bismol (or pink bismuth) specifically is known to turn the tongue and/or stool black temporarily. this condition can persist for a few days after you take the product. the effect depends on how much pepto you took too. if the black stool goes away after a few days you probably have nothing to worry about. if it persists for more than a week you probably should see a health care provider. bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract (everything from your stomach to your rectum) can cause the stool to turn black. i'm going to assume however that the situation is temporary due to the use of pink bismuth. wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery!

Patient Question:
will clindamycin hcl treat a bladder infection?

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you're thinking about self-medicating don't do it. have you been diagnosed with a "bladder infection " or did you self-diagnose this? if a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection. as you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections. an antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected. when a person decides to self-diagnose and self-medicate they do themselves a grave disservice. in taking a "leftover" antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment. this can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications. if you believe you have a urinary tract infection (much more likely than a "bladder" infection) i suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center. they will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic. many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a uti or bladder infection. even if you'd had a uti before do not assume you "know" that's what's causing your symptoms. only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract. wishing you well!

there's really not much point in washing your face before exercise. you need to cleanse your skin after exercising and sweating in order to make sure you don't develop blocked pores or possible fungal infections of the skin. interestingly it's equally important to thoroughly dry your skin after exercising. fungal infections such as " jock itch " can arise if the skin stays damp. so be sure to towel off thoroughly and perhaps apply powder if you can't get completely dry. ps: women can get "jock itch " too. hope this helps! no i dont think it's wise to do this especially if you wash it with hot/warm water-- leaves the skin dry.

Patient Question:
what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?

Actual Doctor's Response:
regular physical activity protects against crc. we can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against crc. statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect crc in a positive way. postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the women’s health initiative study to reduce the incidence of crc. dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin b6 all have positive effects in reducing crc. and non-herbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against crc. antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. but the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant. drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a person’s life risk for colorectal cancer. if a person’s body mass index (bmi) is over 25 there is a 1. 5 fold increase in their risk. researchers also noted an increase in incidence of crc and death from crc if a person smoked. and in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics the risk of crc was 30% higher for the diabetic group. another factor that increases a person’s risk for crc is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease. inflammation throughout the gi tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against crc. finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor. if you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance.

the development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cat's claw pierced the skin of your upper lip. unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same. with time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable. one thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin e-based oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar. if it really is a problem you'll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options.

it is possible to receive social security disability (ssdi) or supplemental security benefits (ssi) based upon your medical and emotional conditions. do not listen to those well-meaning people who may say that your diagnoses will not qualify you for disability. you do not have to have a terminal disease to become eligible for disability. the waiting process for approval can range from 6 months to several years so you must be ready to live without a regular pay check for some time. you must also be incapable of doing any gainful work. if you feel that you cannot continue to work it is recommended to start the application process immediately. if approved your original application date will be used to establish the approval date and possible retroactive benefits. you may also think about contacting an attorney specializing in helping folks to obtain disability benefits. the application process can be cumbersome and becomes a living legal document which will be used to assess your eligibility. attempting to correct mistakes or supply missing documentation later is not recommended. treat the application responsibility and do it right the first time. if it seems like too much work then it is best to forget applying. the application should be initiated as correctly and completely as possible the first time. you should begin to start a daily diary detailing your activities of daily living and your medical and emotional symptoms experienced. you should also gather all of your medical records from each medical professional that has provided you with medical care. attempt to secure the backing of your primary care doctor as well as other medical specialists to support your disability claim. they may be able to provide you with a letter attesting to your being completely disabled. also seek a letter from your employer stating their observance of you being unable to complete your job responsibilities due to your disabilities. letters from other people testifying that they are aware of your physical and emotional decline may also be useful. the majority of people are denied at the first step of the approval process. but with a legitimate disability being adequately documented and by following the above guidelines eventual disability approval is possible with your clinical conditions.

not the smell but the carcinogen (cancer-causing) residue that may be on your clothes or skin. this is called third-hand smoke. before you hold this little infant take a shower wash you hair and change your clothes. and. if you have plan on having a meaningful contact with this child as it grows you had better stop smoking now so you will be around to enjoy this new life.

Patient Question:
if i take tylenol pm and tylenol arthritis pain am i taking too much? what is the limit for acetaminophen each day?

Actual Doctor's Response:
recently there has not been a new limit established. we are still using the guidelines of 4000 milligrams a day if you are an adult and 2000 milligrams for an elderly adult. now tylenol pm does contain some tylenol and it contains also benadryl to help you sleep. arthritis tylenol i believe has a higher amount of tylenol so you want to be really careful about how many times you take it a day. come and talk to your pharmacist. we will be able to sit down with you and discuss how many milligrams you might be taking with the one product and then in the evening product the tylenol pm. and figure out how much you are taking on a daily basis. we might ask you to take not as much of the tylenol arthritis product because you are hitting that limit each day. so be really careful come and talk to the pharmacist bring your list of medications because you may not have been aware that some of the prescription medications that you are on may also contain tylenol. that is the reason why it's been in the news because people were taking prescription medication that contained tylenol along with additional over-the-counter tylenol products. so basically come and ask the pharmacist is the medication expert we are a resource for you and we are here to help you.

while it's impossible to say exactly how long a multivitamin is effective understanding how different vitamins are absorbed and stored in the body can give you some idea. generally water soluble vitamins (b vitamins and vitamin c) aren't stored in the body. instead they are absorbed based on need with the remaining excesses being excreted in the urine. this is why it's important to get these vitamins on a regular basis. on the other hand fat soluble vitamins (a d e and k) need fat present to be absorbed and are stored in the body for later use (fat tissue and liver). so basically some of the vitamins are excreted daily while others are stored. for more on the difference between fat and water soluble vitamins see this webmd article <link>

Patient Question:
can i give my 2-year-old children's benadryl and robitussin cough syrup together?

Actual Doctor's Response:
children’s benadryl contains diphenhydramine and is labeled for use for children aged 6 and older. children’s robitussin is available in a variety of different formulations but may contain guaifenesin dextromethorphan and/or phenylephrine. children’s robitussin is labeled for use for children aged 4 and older (and in some products aged 6 and older). while it is safe to take both the children’s benadryl and children’s robitussin together i would not recommend these products for your child based on her age.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9857
i would not recommend giving your child both medications. ceron dm syrup contains chlorpheniramine dextromethorphan and phenylephrine. dextromethorphan is the cough suppressant while phenylephrine is the nasal decongestant. chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine very similar to claritin. therefore your child is already getting allergy symptom coverage and we would not want to double the dose of this medication. doing so increases the risk of drowsiness additive side effects and possible toxicity issues. use one or the other during this time and continue the claritin once they have stopped using the ceron dm.

surgery for hyperthyroidism (thyroidectomy) removes part or all of the thyroid gland. doctors rarely use this surgery to treat hyperthyroidism. you may need surgery if: your thyroid gland is so big that it is hard for you to swallow or breathe. you have thyroid cancer or your doctor suspects you have thyroid cancer. for more information see the topic thyroid cancer. you had serious side effects from taking antithyroid medicines. and radioactive iodine is not an option for you. you have a large goiter that radioactive iodine treatment did not shrink. you have a single large thyroid nodule that is making too much thyroid hormone and radioactive iodine did not effectively treat the nodule. surgery choices the only surgery for hyperthyroidism is thyroidectomy. what to think about if you are having surgery your doctor will have you take antithyroid medicines before surgery to bring your thyroid hormone levels as close to normal as possible. after surgery your doctor will check your thyroid hormone levels regularly because you may develop hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone medicine. for more information see the topic hypothyroidism. surgery is the fastest way to treat your hyperthyroidism. but it is not used very often and is more risky and expensive than other treatments. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the jury is out on whether vitamin c can prevent a cold. and according to the latest research vitamin c doesn’t make a cold shorter or less severe. although experts do not recommend upping your dosage for that purpose some say it may help ward off germs if you’ve been exposed to physical or environmental stress -- for example with especially strenuous exercise or exposure to bitter cold weather. even so some people swear by it. “i have some vitamin c in my diet every day but i bump the dose up when i get sick ” says lauren richter do assistant professor of family and community medicine at the university of maryland center for integrative medicine. “generally it will reduce the length of the symptoms by at least a day or two and also will help with the severity ” she says. an extra 500 milligrams a day is about all you need.

maybe. it depends on the culture. most stool cultures are for bacteria but some check for other organisms. certainly gonorrhea may be detected but perhaps not chlamydia. if you are concerned that you have been exposed to an std from anal sex you need to specifically ask to be std tested so the right tests can be performed. as noted in the previous answer a stool culture is usually done to detect other bacterial infections not stds. if there has been anal sex the testing should include a swab of the anal area but not a stool sample--in some cases the presence of stool/feces leads to inaccurate results. when getting tested for stds you can request to be tested for oral and anal transmission in addition to regular testing of vagina/penis.

Patient Question:
my doctor says i'm obese. are diet pills a good option?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i have to talk to a lot of patients about weight loss. one of the things that i will ask them is did the doctor go over what their bmi or body mass index is. that gives us an idea of really how obese they might be and then incorporate lifestyle changes first. so many times we think of a pill as an instant quick fix. and that's really not the answer. i'll ask patients how active they are and are they incorporating some type of exercise into their daily routine. simple things like walking can really help reduce weight and make you feel better. you should be walking at least 10 000 steps a day and to help you track that you can actually buy a pedometer in almost any store today. they're pretty inexpensive they are under about $20 and you can actually track your progress through a diary and feel good. also making changes to your diet that can include decreasing the amount of fatty foods that you have making more healthier options. try these options first before you go down the path to medication. there is one over-the-counter medication approved by the fda to help people lose weight and it's called alli or orlistat. orlistat helps people lose weight by blocking some of the fat they eat from being absorbed. even though orlistat is available over-the-counter it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you take it.

psoriasis is an autoimmune condition and over the past 10-15 years. we have discovered the exact pathway that's gone awry and so there are new treatments that we have for it that can target various points along that pathway and these are called biologics and they are prescription based medicines. in psoriasis there is no diet or supplement that has been shown consistently to help treat the psoriasis. so there is nothing out there that you can really do. but psoriasis being an autoimmune condition tends to also be made worse by stress. so managing your stress can help. it won't cure the psoriasis but it can help you have better control over it. other products we use are just moisturizers and even just occlusion. so just having something cover the area and add water in and maybe even a little bit of sunlight along with that can help suppress the psoriasis in that area but it isn't a cure. so what the sunlight does that helps the psoriasis is that it suppresses the immune system in the skin and that's what turns it off. but in the winter it tends to come back and of course you have to be careful not to get too much sun and a sunburn because then you end up with other problems that can be much worse.

if doctors cannot reliably distinguish between shortness of breath from chf and copd both conditions are often treated together. treatments for copd focus on the lungs and the airways the branching network of tubes inside the lungs. the main treatments for copd are bronchodilators inhaled medicines that help open the airways. heart failure treatments reduce the workload on the heart and help prevent unhealthy growth of heart muscle. categories of treatments for heart failure include: diuretics which increase urination and reduce the heart strain from fluid overload. beta-blockers which prevent excessive stress on the heart and reduce blood pressure. however these would not be used if a person is having an acute episode of heart failure. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors which lower blood pressure and reduce heart stress. other blood pressure medicines which prevent long-term damage to the heart. people with severe shortness of breath from copd and heart failure may receive other treatments as well: corticosteroids such as prednisone or solu-medrol which can improve breathing in copd. antibiotics for any bacterial infection that may be contributing. supplemental oxygen. non-invasive positive pressure ventilation a form of machine-assisted breathing. mechanical ventilation or temporary life support through a breathing tube. intravenous medicines to help reduce heart strain. people with both copd and heart failure are often treated by a team of doctors including a primary care physician a cardiologist and a pulmonologist.

there are many things that can cause an itchy anal area so your first step is to be properly examined and diagnosed. not wiping carefully after a bowel movement can result in irritation and this irritation can itch. soap residuals after bathing laundry detergents or perfumed dryer softener sheets can cause a chemical reaction around the anus. minor skin infections or anal fissures (tiny cracks in the skin) can itch. and finally if you have close association with children pinworms are notorious for causing an itchy bottom. pinworms typically come out at night. each of these would have an individual treatment so having a correct diagnosis first is essential even if you are not enthusiastic about having your medical provider examine this area.

what is the difference between novolog 70/30 and novolin 70/30 insulins>

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a very important question so i'm glad you asked. before the new "insulin pens" came out there were four types of insulin : rapid-acting short-acting intermediate-acting and long-acting. when it comes to the pre-mixed insulins like novolog 70/30 there are fewer differences between the brands (for example novolog versus novolin). whether contained in a bottle or in a pen the premixed insulins all contain a combination of both an intermediate-acting insulin and a short-acting insulin. the numbers on the bottle or pen refer to the percentage of each type of insulin contained in the mixture. that means both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 contain a mixture that is 70% intermediate-acting insulin with 30% short-acting insulin. however novolin 70/30 takes slightly longer to begin working than novolog 70/30 which has a rapid onset. both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 may last up to 24 hours in the system. no matter what kind of insulin you've been prescribed it's crucial you understand how to use it correctly. using any insulin incorrectly can cause serious side effects. if you don't understand how to use your insulin please consult a pharmacist as soon as possible. hope this helps!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i would like to know why you decided to stop taking your medications and does your doctor or health care provider know? this is very risky and it is important that you understand that with some medications you should not just stop them abruptly because you felt like it. nor is it wise to just "start them up" again when you feel like it. i would strongly recommend that you call your doctor and let them know what you did. they may want to see you for further evaluation and gradually ease you back onto your medications.

Patient Question:
what is bph?

Actual Doctor's Response:
bph (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is an enlargement of the prostate gland. this gland surrounds the tube that drains the urine from the bladder. the symptoms of bph can be caused by a tensing of the enlarged muscle in the prostate gland which blocks the passage of urine. this can lead to such symptoms as: a weak or start-and-stop stream when urinating a feeling that the bladder is not completely emptied after urination a delay or difficulty in the beginning of urination a need to urinate often during the day and especially at night a feeling that you must urinate immediately.

how can i be sure my cosmetic surgery will be safe?

Actual Doctor's Response:
i think the two most important safety questions that a patient can ask the doctor is one will there be a fully accredited anesthesia specialist in attendance anesthesia specialist being either a certified registered nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist. that’s number one. second is the facility accredited? now accreditation is kind of a broad term. for instance the facility could be licensed by the state. states do that. hospitals are licensed. the state will license a facility. the federal government does the same. in other words you cannot operate on a medicare patient and expect medicare to pay for it unless they’ve given it the stamp of approval. by the way the standards are almost identical. and some facilities for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in do their evaluation and asked to be approved. but there are also private credentialing companies that do this and by the way most hospitals in the united states are accredited by essentially what is called the joint commission. it’s called the joint commission on accreditation of health facilities. this licenses hospitals outpatient surgery centers radiology x-ray clinics. so again very high standards so that there is no a or b it’s all a. if you get the right answers to those questions you’ll feel comfortable. and i would tell you also parenthetically most of the doctor anesthesiologists that i know will not work in an unaccredited unlicensed facility because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. for example if the facility didn’t have all the appropriate life support systems why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong he doesn’t have the technical backup. he doesn’t want to be in that position. he wants to deliver to the patient when needed if needed as remote as that possibility is he wants to deliver the best he has.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the best answer to your question is this: consult your physician. you're smart to think about the "blood thinning" properties of over-the-counter pain relievers given you're on coumadin (warfarin). generally speaking it's not wise to take any nsaid -- such as aspirin naproxyn or ibuprofen -- when you're taking warfarin or another anti-clotting drug. in this case acetaminophen (tylenol) is your only over-the-counter option. however you should ask your health care provider what to do in your specific case. everyone is different and your provider may be able to give you a prescription pain reliever that will not interact with the warfarin. wishing you well! soma or carisoprodol is a generic drug and is used for the treatment of muscle pain and muscle injury. it is used by the person who is suffering from muscle sprain and pain. you can from chemist shop or online at topdrugmart dot com

Actual Doctor's Response:
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. the fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with. i'm glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled. that is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation. while you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system. look for support from family and friends. try to distract yourself. focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem. if you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress. even though you have a family history of cancer it's not a sure bet you have cancer too. it's entirely possible your breast lump is benign (non-cancerous) and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress. i know it's hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis. take care of yourself!

the most common cause of sore throat is a virus and most will last about a week unless of course you are developing a particularly nasty viral infection called mononucleosis (mono). if your sore throat does not resolve in a week your doctor should consider ordering a mono test (ebv panel). hopefully you had a culture done (takes 2-3 days) since rapid strep tests are not 100% accurate. as far as what to do about your "extreme pain" i am at a loss since i really have no way of seeing your throat or review your medical history. gargling with warm saline (1/4 tsp of table salt with 8 oz of warm water) can help. ibuprofen can help. again it is not typical to have extreme pain with a simple viral sore throat so you may need to be re-examined.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i agree with poison control. i can't imagine that your headache or bloody nose has anything to do with the fact that you had a clip-on mosquito repellent. the most common cause of headache is the a muscle-tension type but you would need to see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. oh that is a relief! thank you! but it's strange because no pain meds are helping at all with the pain. it is very possible it was caused by over exposure to this product. the off clip on does not use deet but a different kind of repellent called metofluthrin so the symptoms will not be the same as over exposure to deet. the first day i used one for a 3 hour hunt i got a pretty severe headache that started about 30 minutes after the hunt and lasted about 4 hours. i was just recovering from a virus to i initially thought nothing of it. later the same day i found one of the top customer reviews for this product on amazon. com mentions it caused severe headaches almost everytime he used it. the warning labels seem to go overboard in cautioning you to wash your hands and clothes after handling to the point it made me a bit nervous about using the product. i would venture to say from my own experience and the amazon reviewers experiences using the product as directed and still getting headaches if you fell asleep in an enclosed space with this thing blowing that its almost certain that most of your symptoms can be attributed to it. this is apparently some extremely potent poison.

Patient Question:
any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i'm too tired to cook after work?

Actual Doctor's Response:
you are definitely not alone. however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day. for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite. if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to (and not calories) like rotisserie chicken. just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro. pick out veggies at the salad bar — they are already washed chopped and prepped for you. you can take them home and roast them in a 450 degree f oven for 5-7 minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. this is a great and easy veggie side dish that wouldn’t take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils. sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating. for instance tonight i got home after 12 hours of traveling and i’m battling over what i could make for dinner — or — to pick up thai food. i think that thai is going to win tonight. but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order. i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk. while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra 1000 calories that can come from some of the richer choices won’t be worth it. what will be a much better choice will still be delicious. spring rolls that are fresh — not fried — and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice. another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil (ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants). also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice. i’m reminding myself of this as i am you. when i’m tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice. another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out. many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices.

there are certain key foods that really seem to keep you feeling satisfied for longer such as beans! i find when i have a bean burrito for example even if it's on the smaller side it really stays with me. another bean idea is edamame (green soybeans) just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger. basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein and/or water content help make this happen. beans are rich in all three. smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too. foods with monounsaturated fat (olive oil olives nuts) and omega-3s (fish canola oil walnuts soy and pecans). here are some foods rich in soluble fiber: beans. oats. barley -- look for soups with barley! some fruits (apples mango plums kiwi pears blackberries strawberries raspberries peaches citrus fruits). some vegetables (artichoke celery root sweet potato parsnip turnip acorn squash potato with skin brussel sprouts cabbage green peas broccoli carrots cauliflower asparagus and beets). one of the best pieces of advice for you though may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer too. green tea is full of helpful phytochemicals so find some flavors you really enjoy (tropical green or peppermint green tea etc. ) or warm up some broth or tomato-based soups as a mid-meal snack.

hi do you think these symptoms are what you have its something called pelvic inflammatory disease although a link is not entirely clear some evidence suggests bv may increase your risk of developing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). pid involves infection and inflammation (swelling) of the upper female genital tract including the womb fallopian tubes and ovaries. symptoms of pid include: pain around the pelvis or lower abdomen discomfort or pain during sex felt deep inside the pelvis bleeding between periods and after sex if diagnosed at an early stage pid can usually be treated successfully with a course of antibiotics. however an estimated one in five women with the condition will become infertile because of severe scarring on the fallopian tubes. it's important to see your gp if you experience any symptoms of pid. delaying treatment for pid or having repeated episodes of pid can increase your risk of infertility. is this how it started? bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common yet poorly understood condition in which the balance of bacteria inside the vagina becomes disrupted. bv does not usually cause any vaginal soreness or itching but it often causes unusual vaginal discharge. if you have the condition your discharge may: develop a strong fishy smell particularly after sexual intercourse become a white or grey colour become thin and watery bv is not serious for the vast majority of women this info is from the nhs in the uk but bv it’s the same around the world. do hope you find some help here. good luck

3 year olds nose has a bad smell coming fron it

Actual Doctor's Response:
the most common reason for this is a foreign body usually food. your three-year old for some reason decided it was a good idea to put a green bean pea or? in the nose. if there is a bad smell and a nasty drainage from just one-side this is the most likely reason. nasal foreign bodies can be challenging to remove so it may be a good idea to allow the medical provider to do it for you.

i am single no children age 45 and at the moment unemployed. . often i perform independent work or part-time assignments and have not been carrying an individual health plan for myself since 2006. what low-cost options are there for someone like me with or without a job?

Actual Doctor's Response:
for people with very low incomes the law provides a fair amount of financial assistance to make insurance affordable. depending on how much you earn in a year you may qualify for medicaid coverage which would be virtually no-cost coverage. if you make too much to qualify or you live in a state not expanding its medicaid program you'll likely qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of your insurance. to give you an early idea of your likely costs check out webmd's cost calculator. starting october 1st you can log on to your state's marketplace and start shopping for a health plan to learn your options.

that's a great question. under the law open enrollment will start on october 1st. you can take a look at the plans available to you in your state and purchase a plan that will start january 1. since insurers can no longer deny anyone coverage you're guaranteed access to a health plan. in addition it sounds like you're likely to qualify for a tax credit that will lower the cost of coverage. anyone earning less than about $46 000 a year will qualify for some kind of financial assistance.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer based on your story you are highly highly unlikely to get pregnant in this way. sperm may look like tadpoles but they do not remain viable for very long in the mouth/throat and any expectorate that flowed past your genital area in the shower an hour later would not have the potential of cause you to become pregnant. swallowed semen cannot result in a pregnancy and even if there was a stray super-sperm that flowed past your vaginal area it would be a one in a zillion chance that it would squiggle up your vagina through your uterus and make it to a viable egg (assuming your were ovulating at the time. you are engaging in sexual activity which tends to escalate to more risky behavior in the future so you would be wise to use effective contraception from now on.

most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. it sounds quite unpleasant! unfortunately it's impossible to answer your question in a forum like this because diagnosing the problem requires a physical examination. i suggest you consult your primary healthcare provider for an exam. that said the situation doesn't sound dire. a lump in the area you describe would probably be a nodule in the skin such as a fatty cyst. of course if you're talking about a lump on the ribcage near breast tissue then this would be a concern. but i'm reading your question as a lump underneath the bottom of your ribcage on the left side. at any rate a trip to the doctor is in order to get some answers. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
the symptoms are similar for all forms of prostatitis with the exception of acute prostatitis and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. symptoms of the chronic forms of prostatitis including chronic prostatitis/ pelvic pain syndrome inflammatory and noninflammatory may include: a frequent urge to urinate although you may pass only small amounts of urine. a burning sensation when urinating (dysuria). difficulty starting urination interrupted flow (urinating in waves rather than a steady stream) weaker-than-normal urine flow and dribbling after urinating. excessive urinating at night (nocturia). a sensation of not completely emptying the bladder. pain or discomfort in the lower back in the area between the testicles and anus in the lower abdomen or upper thighs or above the pubic area. pain may become worse during a bowel movement. pain or vague discomfort during or after ejaculation. pain in the tip of the penis. with acute prostatitis symptoms are severe come on suddenly and include fever and chills. signs of chronic bacterial prostatitis may be milder and come on suddenly or gradually over weeks or months and the symptoms may come and go. symptoms alone cannot be used to determine the type of prostatitis you have. numerous other conditions such as a bladder infection or benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) can cause symptoms similar to those of prostatitis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Actual Doctor's Response:
those "glances" that pronounce a strep diagnosis really bug me. i hate those "treat 'em and street 'em" medical encounters. a strep test is so easy. so fast. so why not get an accurate definitive diagnosis before treating anyone with antibiotics and steroids? most sore throats are viral. not strep. and one of those viruses (ebv) causes mononucleosis (mono). giving antibiotics to someone with undiagnosed mono is worthless and can actually make things worse. a mono test is easy to do as well but apparently the er medical provider didn't want to take those extra steps. lymph nodes normally enlarge in response to infection or inflammation in their neighborhood so strep (if you really had it) respiratory viruses and mono can all cause lymph node enlargements. viruses (even mono) self-resolve over time and do not respond to antibiotics. if you did have strep the penicillin injection (painful! ) would have taken care of it. if you don't get better see your regular medical provider. and insist on a careful thorough examination for mono and a few diagnostic lab tests.

Actual Doctor's Response:
only if the shingles is in the ears. called ramsay-hunt syndrome. if you had this herpes infection in your ear area it can also cause tinnitus in some people. if you have herpes on your butt. tinnitus would not be related. shingles does not break out on both sides of your buttocks (it follows a nerve pathway and nerves do not cross over the midline of the spine) so i am guessing you have an incorrect diagnosis. you likely have something other than shingles causing your skin eruption.

this is a very common problem in men. usually along the lower part of the beard area and the neck there are two issues that could be going on. one is that you are using the wrong products in the wrong way and two is that there may be an underlying medical condition. so let's start with the straightforward simple to treat part. it's important to treat when your skin is the most hydrated that is when there is most water in the skin which would be towards the end of the shower or after showering and that's when your skin has the most water in it and it’s softest. it's also important to use a shaving cream or gel that will add some hydration to the skins that will go along with the razor very nicely. it's also critical to use a razor that's very sharp. if there is one dull point on a razor that one dull point will eventually hit every part of the skin and will create irritation. so use a razor that's new and sharp and if you keep getting the bumps try changing to a different type of razor that might help as well. after you shave you should use an aftershave and try to look for one that has some emollients in it like glycerin something that's alcohol free. a lot of aftershaves can be up to 85% alcohol which can be very irritating to the skin. if that persists if you still have the bumps after that in men who have very curly hair such as men with skin of color. or some very redheads can have very curly hair as well what happens is that when you get a very close shave as the hair grows back in the hair curls and the tip of the hair sticks back into the skin and that's called pseudofolliculitis barbae. so a folliculitis would be an inflammation of the follicle a pseudofolliculitis is because that hair is sticking back into the skin and creating something like an inflammation of the follicle but it's really a skin irritation and barbae means beard area. so for this what we do is either try not to get as close a shave if that's okay or you can use some prescription medications that will help soothe and soften the area to try to prevent that. if worst comes to worst you can try laser hair removal for the area and that's typically fine to do in the neck area where it won't really show but most men don't want their beard hair completely removed. but those are some tools that can help you.

well the downside to these products is that there are side effects. for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications. if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication. this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems. because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure. the combination can be deadly. there can be some visual disorders. one of the big side effects is that the drug really isn’t being used correctly for many men. they’re either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before it’s effective they try it once and they say it’s not going to work and they’ll go try something else. the other thing is it’s become very recreational. a lot of guys who don’t need it are taking it which raises some concerns. why? because it’s almost become the thing to do. you know you take the drug and you’re guaranteed a good erection. well if you had good erections before it probably won’t help but it’s just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun. the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction that’s a symptom of something far more serious whether it’s diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders. that’s an early warning sign. and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause i’m really doing them a lot of disservice. if it’s truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if it’s the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you don’t do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented. it’s essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction. some men just get it and that’s the way that you are. but you want to make sure that there’s nothing serious that you’re missing.

there are lots of other skin eruptions that can cause these symptoms but unfortunately i have no way of seeing what you have over the internet. scabies is typtically transmitted person-to-person but it is possible that it could be transmitted on contaminated equipment. there are skin scraping tests to determine if you have scabies but your doctor may not be set up to do it. you may need to see a dermatologist. i have to say that scabies typically does not spread like this nor is it common on the face so there is a good chance you have "something else".

Patient Question:
how do i become a better runner as someone with moderate experience running?

Actual Doctor's Response:
don’t get stuck constantly doing the same thing. challenge your current routine by experimenting with different types of runs. for example incorporate long runs to build endurance intervals to increase speed or hills to increase strength. you might find that experimenting with these different types of runs can add to the enjoyment you experience while running and can help to promote better running performance. next consider occasionally doing cross-training which in this case means doing exercise other than running. for example try adding swimming biking or strength training to your current exercise routine. cross-training helps to prevent burnout whether physical or mental and can help prevent overuse injuries. sometimes repeatedly doing the same exercise can be monotonous and redundant and you might get bored and want to discontinue with your exercise. adding variety to your routine can help keep exercise enjoyable for you. finally allow yourself time to rest and recover. over-training can hurt your progress and lead to injury such as stress fractures. resting is as important as the time you dedicate towards running.

i found that having a pedometer was a big assistance in exercise. i did not set a goal to start because i knew that having been sedentary i would not be able to do 10 000 steps to start off with but i could do some walking. everyday i tried to increase the number of steps and the pedometer gave me something to gauge that with. it has become something of a game for me and it is amazing how many steps it is to go to one of the big box stores and go up and down the aisles.

Patient Question:
is it safe to have cosmetic surgery while breastfeeding?

Actual Doctor's Response:
that issue revolves around what medication one will get during the procedure and whether or not these medications would enter the milk and then be passed to the infant. each medication that is given in the operating room and post-operatively has a history of whether or not it would be likely to enter into the mother’s milk. but frankly science is never 100% and i am very cautious and conservative. i don’t believe in taking any chances with the new baby and therefore i would suggest that if a mother is breastfeeding that the surgery be put off until breastfeeding is complete. the alternative would be for the mother to just stop breastfeeding for some period of time and not resume it until we are quite certain that all the medications have cleared from the system which is typically a matter of some days.

pvc dildo not properly cleaned after anal use. can i still use it if i clean it? . i used a dido anally a few weeks back and i checked it today. it's a dildo with a syringe for squirting so it has a hole through it. it's made of pvc. when i checked it today there was something inside the hole for squirting that i can only assume was fecal matter. i want to avoid infections at all costs so is this toy safe to use if i clean it properly? should it now be used with a condom only andhow can i clean it to make it safe again? i have not used it again since i found this.

Actual Doctor's Response:
pvc like silicone is non porous so if you clean it properly it will be safe. it's worthwhile to go to a smoke shop or craft store and pick up a pack of pipe cleaners they are perfect for going in that little hole and catching anything you need to. then fill the syringe with some rubbing alcohol and pass it through a few times clean the outside with more rubbing alcohol let it dry and you're good to go.

you can clean it for re-use because it's made of silicone which is generally non porous. maybe soak it in some rubbing alcohol use something thin like a pipe cleaner to clean out the hole wash it well let it dry thoroughly and you should be good. it wouldn't be the same story if it were porous then you might have a harder time cleaning it.

the question of whether or not it is wise to have cosmetic surgery while pregnant comes up most often when a patient who is scheduled for surgery finds out that she is pregnant. she then calls us and asks for our advice. nearly all the procedures that we do in elective cosmetic facial surgery are done under anesthesia; it is never wise to have a procedure while pregnant. that is why we do a pregnancy test just prior to the surgery. the chances of aborting the fetus are extremely high if one has a general anesthetic in the first three months of pregnancy. in any event even if one were beyond the first three months it just doesn’t make much sense because the body during pregnancy has changed with respect to circulating levels of hormones. there are blood count issues and a variety of reasons why it makes absolutely no sense to have an elective procedure during pregnancy. even if an operation could be done under local anesthesia i would never undertake such an operation because the local anesthetic itself gets into the blood stream and could possibly enter the fetal circulation. bottom line why ever take a chance?

Patient Question:
what are the different kinds of hives?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hives fall into two categories: acute urticaria (ordinary hives which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic urticaria (which continue longer than six to eight weeks). ordinary urticaria (ordinary hives) what are symptoms and signs of ordinary hives? ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. welts appear often in several places. they flare itch swell and go away in a matter of minutes to hours only to appear elsewhere. this sequence may go on from days to weeks. most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. although that cutoff point is arbitrary hives that last more than six weeks are often called "chronic. " what are the causes of ordinary hives? as noted above many cases of ordinary hives are "idiopathic " meaning no cause is known. others may be triggered by viral infections. a few may be caused by medications usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (it is uncommon for drugs taken continuously for long periods to cause hives or other reactions. ) when a medication is implicated as a cause of hives the drug must be stopped since no skin or blood test will prove the connection. in most cases drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. if a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away this is a strong indication that the medication was not in fact the cause of the hives. some medications like morphine codeine aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids such as ibuprofen [advil]) cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. despite the reputation hives have for being "allergic " when there is no obvious connection between something new that a person has been exposed to and the onset of hives allergy testing is not usually helpful. chronic hives chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. the evaluation of this condition is difficult and allergy testing and other laboratory tests are rarely useful in such cases. the accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history personal habits and oral intake. occasionally it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. certain systemic disease and infections may occasionally present in the skin as hives. if there is an inciting cause that can be determined then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective or in the case of food or drug allergy strict avoidance would be necessary. there are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. there are tests available to identify this type of hives. physical urticaria is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. by far the most common form is dermographism which literally means "skin writing. " this is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed: a red welt appears at the line of the scratch. in dermographism raised itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin causing mast cells to leak histamine. another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. this produces hundreds of small itchy bumps. these occur within 15 minutes of exercise or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. this form of hives happens more often in young people. other forms of physical hives are much less common. triggers for these include cold water and sunlight.

hives or urticaria are a common allergic reaction in which a rash or welts appear on the skin. hives are typically quite itchy and can last just a few minutes or several days before going away. occasionally however these annoying blotches can indicate more serious problems especially when accompanied by symptoms such as difficult breathing. in angioedema swelling develops beneath the skin and in serious cases can cause disabling swelling of internal organs life-threatening blockage of air passages or severe uncontrollable intestinal contractions. in rare cases the swelling occurs in the throat and causes suffocation. angioedema sometimes occurs with hives but is not itchy or red. chronic cases of angioedema that do not occur with hives may be the result of a condition called hereditary angioedema. simultaneously developing hives along with complicating symptoms such as fever nausea abdominal cramps shortness of breath and a drop in blood pressure after a bee sting insect bite or drug injection strongly suggests anaphylaxis. this severe shock to the immune system requires prompt medical attention. in rare cases failure to get help quickly can be fatal.

Actual Doctor's Response:
after you've been infected with a pneumonia -causing organism it takes as little as 1 to 3 days or as long as 7 to 10 days for symptoms to appear. how severe pneumonia is and how long it lasts depend on: your age and health. older sicker people usually have more severe cases and their pneumonia is more likely to have complications such as bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) or throughout the body (septicemia). whether bacteria or a virus caused the pneumonia. viral pneumonia usually is less severe than bacterial pneumonia. how quickly you treat it. the sooner you treat pneumonia the sooner symptoms go away. your immune system. people who have impaired immune systems are more likely to have more severe cases of pneumonia than people who have healthy immune systems. in healthy people pneumonia can be a mild illness that is hardly noticed and clears up in 2 to 3 weeks. in older adults and in people with other health problems recovery may take 6 to 8 weeks or longer. if you have severe pneumonia you may have to go to the hospital. in most cases of pneumonia you get in your daily life such as at school or work (community-based pneumonia) it is not necessary to go to the hospital. 1 about one-third of people with community-based pneumonia are age 65 or older. 1 older adults are treated in the hospital more often and stay longer for the condition than younger people. 1 pneumonia is more serious in this group because they often have and may develop other medical problems. 1 if your pneumonia is caused by a virus or bacteria you may spread the infection to other people while you are contagious. how long you are contagious depends on what is causing the pneumonia and whether you get treatment. you may be contagious for several days to a week. if you get antibiotics you usually cannot spread the infection to others after a day of treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever? . my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on. he won't go to a doctor because he does not have insurance. just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling "under the weather" for a few days. no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache. so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body.

Actual Doctor's Response:
whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (99. 9 oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!

Patient Question:
what is the difference between healthy and unhealthy fat?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most food contains several kinds of fat and some are better for you than others. some fat is needed in your diet so it’s not a good idea to completely eliminate all fat. instead choose foods with healthier fats and enjoy them in moderation. unhealthy fats include saturated and trans fats (also called partially hydrogenated fats). sources of unhealthy fats come from eggs meat dairy and tropical oils (coconut palm and palm kernel oils). good fats include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. healthy fat sources include nuts seeds avocados olives and other plants. healthy oils aid in having healthy skin hair and a strong immune system. saturated fats and trans fats grams should be less than 10% of your total calories for the day. to determine the healthfulness of fat consider where it comes from -- animal vs. plant origin. healthy fats coming from plants (and fish) are beneficial for health especially when replacing saturated fat (animal fats) in the diet. at too high levels saturated fats can adversely affect heart health. saturated fats are found in high-fat meats full-fat dairy baked goods and fried foods. trans fat the worse fat of all is mostly found in products (i. e margarine) that contain vegetable oils that have been "partially hydrogenated" to become solid at room temperature. since 2006 fda requires companies to label trans fat in food products. if an item contains <. 5g it can be labeled "trans-fat free. "&nbsp; because the american heart association recommends 2g or less per day for the average 2000 calorie diet check the ingredient line for partially hydrogenated fats. &nbsp;for example &nbsp;natural peanut butter only has peanuts (and salt in some cases) in the ingredient line but other peanut butter products often contain partially hydrogenated oils and added sugar. &nbsp; for more on good and bad fats see this webmd article <link> while some dietary fats are good and some are bad; perhaps the worst is trans fat. this type of fat can occur naturally in animal products but is also the result of food manufacturers chemically altering oils through a process called hydrogenation. the reason that trans fat is so detrimental is because it not only raises bad (ldl) cholesterol levels but some research suggests that it also lowers our good (hdl) cholesterol levels as well – a double whammy. saturated fats on the other hand raise both good and bad cholesterol levels. common food sources of trans fat can include: • baked goods such as bread pizza dough and cake • fried foods such as french fries doughnuts or chicken nuggets • snack foods such as chips crackers cookies and candy • pre-packaged foods such as soup or frozen meals • margarines or spreads be cautious because the fda allows for food products to be labeled as “0 trans fat” even though there may be up to 0. 5 grams per serving. read this webmd article for more information: <link>. heathy fats come from healthy foods like nuts and unheathy fats come from fatty foods chips. healhty fats and polyunsaturated fats which help to get better healthy by removing cholestrol and unhealthy fats are saturated trans fats which increases the risk of heart attacks.

it’s no surprise that the latest version of the usda dietary guidelines continues to urge americans to eat less sugar. that’s a given with “sugar” generally being extra calories without any nutritional contribution and our high obesity rates. i think the biggest push should be to dramatically reduce our intake of sweetened beverages which don’t even seem to register in our brains and bodies as “consumed calories. ” talk about empty calories! it looks like we have another great reason to eat less sugar this year. sugar prices are predicted to go up for european manufacturers due to bad weather speculative hedging on supplies and stockpiling across the world. i’m guessing the sugar market in the u. s. may go through something similar. that means prices will probably go up for you and me at the supermarket when buying products containing sugar. yet another reason to think twice before buying processed food. suggestion: save money by baking your own muffins cakes and cookies. this way you can use less sugar (you can usually cut the sugar by a third from the original recipe) switch to using at least half whole-wheat flour and switch to using smarter cooking fats (like canola oil). think of it as a relaxing activity that you can do in the evening. in addition to your health your wallet may be better for it!

Patient Question:
is it true that using two condoms are better than one?

Actual Doctor's Response:
our society generally believes two is better than one. the problem is that the way condoms are designed using two condoms at the same time could actually do more harm than good. it could cause some friction between the condoms that could actually cause more breakage and leakage. so we like to let everyone know especially teens to keep it simple. just use one condom each and every time you have sex. viruses can get through some of the natural skin condoms so they don't protect against all sexually transmitted infections. we recommend the latex--or polyurethane which tend to be more expensive but need to be used by people who have latex allergies. it's important that teens recognize that the condom needs to be put on as soon as there’s an erection. not waiting until there's been a little foreplay because there's ejaculate that can be released that can cause both stds and unplanned pregnancies. even though it's so important to use a condom consistently and correctly many teens don't know how. health care providers teen clinics and educational materials can provide information on how to use a condom properly.

Patient Question:
what are the different types of psoriatic arthritis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are five types of psoriatic arthritis. it is important to know which type of psoriatic arthritis you have and to understand the characteristics so that it may be treated properly. symmetric psoriatic arthritis : symmetric arthritis affects the same joints -- usually in multiple matching pairs -- on opposite sides of the body. symmetric psoriatic arthritis can be disabling causing varying degrees of progressive destructive disease and loss of function in 50% of people with this type of arthritis. symmetric psoriatic arthritis resembles rheumatoid arthritis. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis : asymmetric arthritis typically involves one to three joints in the body -- large or small -- such as the knee hip or one or several fingers. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis does not affect matching pairs of joints on opposite sides of the body. distal interphalangeal predominant (dip) : distal interphalangeal predominant psoriatic arthritis involves primarily the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. dip psoriatic arthritis is sometimes confused with osteoarthritis a chronic disease that causes the deterioration of joint cartilage and bone as well as bone spurs at the joints. spondylitis : spondylitis affects the spinal column and may cause inflammation and stiffness in the neck lower back spinal vertebrae or sacroiliac region (pelvic area) making motion difficult. spondylitis also can attack connective tissue such as ligaments or cause arthritic disease in the joints of the arms hips legs or feet. arthritis mutilans : arthritis mutilans is a severe deforming and destructive form of psoriatic arthritis that primarily affects the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. this leads to lost function of the involved joints. it also is frequently associated with lower back and neck pain. fortunately this type of psoriatic arthritis is rare.

psoriatic arthritis frequently involves inflammation of the knees ankles and joints in the feet and hands. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a sausage. joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in about 50% of those with spondylitis the genetic marker hla-b27 can be found. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called mutilans can cause rapid damage to the joints of the hands and feet and loss of their function. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. this inflammation may lead to an enthesopathy which is inflammation of a tendon at the site where it inserts into the bone. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis.

how can exercise boost brainpower?

Actual Doctor's Response:

i would like to know if you went to see a doctor or health care provider when you fell and if you are still seeing them. it is very important that you advise them that you are still in pain so they can re-evaluate your condition and possibly prescribe treatment. at the end of the day your quality of life is the most important and if you are on the right medications it will actually help. when pain is not treated properly it can cause other issues like insomnia and depression not to mention the fact that you may call out sick from work or not be able to focus on work -- something that is called "presenteeism.

what is sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome?

Actual Doctor's Response:
sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome is a chronic disorder that involves the skin bone and joints. synovitis means inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). typically this causes warmth tenderness pain swelling and stiffness of involved joints (arthritis). acne is a skin condition featuring tiny areas of inflammation with pus formation at the hair follicles. acne occurs most commonly on the face and upper back. pustulosis is a very inflammatory skin condition resulting in large fluid-filled blister-like areas (pustules) typically on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet. the skin of these areas peels and flakes (exfoliates). hyperostosis means abnormal excessive growth of bone. the hyperostosis of the sapho syndrome frequently is located at the points of the bone where tendons attach. osteitis means inflammation of the bone. patients with sapho syndrome can develop inflammation of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis) as well as inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) which leads to stiffness and pain of the neck and back.

emphysema and chronic bronchitis are chronic (long-term) lung diseases that make it hard to breathe. both diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd) meaning they are conditions that cause a limitation in airflow. emphysema and chronic bronchitis can occur separately or together and are usually the result of cigarette smoking. in addition although it happens rarely a genetic form of emphysema can occur early in adulthood even if you never smoked. in the united states copd is vastly underdiagnosed. while only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with copd experts believe the majority of smokers develop some degree of airflow obstruction. emphysema comes on gradually after years of exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke. with emphysema the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged. because the tiny sacs lose their "stretch " less air gets in and out of the lungs. this causes you to feel short of breath. with chronic bronchitis the airways that carry air to the lungs are inflamed and produce a lot of mucus. the mucus and inflammation cause the airways to narrow or become obstructed making it difficult to breathe. once the airways are irritated over a long period the lining of the airways becomes thickened. this thickening of the airways results in an irritating cough hampered airflow and lung scarring. the damaged airways then become a breeding place for bacterial infections such as pneumonia.

do facial exercise treatment "machines" really stimulate the muscles in the face and jaw line to tighten them? . i am a 62-year-old female with a sagging jaw line and neck. what can you tell me about this treatment?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the majority of visible wrinkles that we observe are due to extrinsic aging. extrinsic factors are associated with damage to the upper layers of the skin (epidermis or dermis) primarily from either sun damage or smoking. extrinsic aging cannot be corrected with facial exercises. i encourage daily exercise for your overall health and well-being. however "exercising" your facial muscles will not reverse skin damage or premature wrinkling due to extrinsic factors.

the place to start is with proper skin care and this means sun protection every day all year round. after that i recommend using products that contain retinoids. you should also have your dermatologist evaluate your skin to better guide you as to whether or not microdermabrasion chemical peels or laser peels would be best for you. microdermabrasion is a superficial treatment that may help fine lines and wrinkles when used with the right skin care products. there are many different types of chemical peels available some are superficial and others can go to deeper layers of the skin. they should be done by your aesthetic/cosmetic dermatologist in order to have the best results and minimize risks.

Actual Doctor's Response:
unfortunately there is no standard charge. however there are some price transparency tools that can help give you an idea. if you get insurance at work check to see if your employer offers one. your insurer may also have a pricing tool. and then there are sites such as fairhealthconsumer. org healthbluebook. com and newchoicehealth. com. these generally offer you pricing information based on past insurance claims submitted in your area. hospitals are contracted with insurance companys. hospitals can charge whatever they want. but insurances tell the hospital "per contract" what the hospital is allowed to charge. then the hospital does the contractual "adjustment" and writes off the difference. i. e. : bx costs $20 000. insurance says no contracted rate is $4 000. hospital writes off $16 000 and bills insurance the $4000. every insurance has a contracted rate for the procedure. again the insurance tells the hospital what it's allowed to charge. one insurance says hospital can bill $4000 another says contracted rate is $5000 another says contracted rate is $3000. so it all really depends on what insurance policy you have and what your insurance states the hospital can charge. bc al allowable is $909. 93 and medicare allowable is $ 606. 62

there are some skills that you can develop to help you improve your ability to manage anger. just like with any other skill set it’s best to practice when you don’t have the pressure of needing to be doing it well in that moment. with this in mind consider the following abcd approach: activity: exercise regularly and then also do it when you feel your anger building. if you don’t already have an exercise routine explore different types of exercise to find the ones you most enjoy (e. g. jogging weight lifting pilates). breathing: deep (or diaphragmatic) breathing can be very helpful in calming down or reducing anxiety. you breathe slowly taking time to pause at the end of each inhale and exhale. with this kind of breathing your stomach will ‘inflate’ like a balloon when you inhale and ‘deflate’ when you exhale. meanwhile your chest will not expand. if this is difficult for you try lying on your back with your knees pulled up and your feet flat on the floor. it can also help to place a hand on your stomach to feel its rise on your inhale. calming activity: find a hobby or activity that you enjoy and can engage in with your full attention. examples are gardening yoga painting or playing music. deepening understanding — of yourself and the other person: it can be extremely helpful to be aware of what ‘pushes your buttons. ’ by fully understanding this you can step back and see it happening which also means that you will not be as caught up in it and can choose to respond differently. so for instance you might say to yourself “there i go again. every time someone even implies that i’m not doing a good job i get furious. ” it can also be helpful to understand the person triggering your anger. chances are that they think their actions are valid; so by understanding their perspective (even if you disagree) you might be able to lessen your own anger and even respond in a way that they can respond more positively to.

Actual Doctor's Response:
since the 1930s when milk was first fortified with vitamin d to prevent rickets the usual recommendation has been 200 iu to 400 iu daily during times of inadequate sun exposure. women above age 50 should be receiving 400 iu to 800 iu. recently experts in the area have been lobbying for a new recommended level of 1 000 iu daily among adults. the food and nutritional board at the institute of medicine began reviewing the published studies in 2008. . . for comparison the upper tolerable limit (adverse results begin to appear) has been reputed to be 2 000 iu/day. many researchers in the field have suggested that the toxic level is closer to 10 000 iu/day over a more prolonged period of time.

vitamin d is made when uv-b rays strike the skin. one general recommendation has been to have 20 minutes of sun exposure to [the] face arms legs or back twice a week during the most intense times for sun exposure (10:00 a. m. through 3:00 p. m. ). alas the amount of vitamin d that can be obtained this way can be limited by several factors. if one has dark skin uses an eight or greater spf sunscreen wears occlusive clothing or gets sun exposure only through window glass -- the amount of vitamin d is greatly decreased. if one lives above the 42nd parallel the months of november through february do not produce sufficient vitamin d even when the sun is not hidden by clouds. cloud cover shade and air pollution will further reduce the amount of uv-b. many of us prefer to get vitamins naturally from whole foods as opposed to supplements. some of the highest sources of vitamin d are listed below: cod liver oil one tablespoon = 1 360 iu. cooked salmon 3. 5 ounces = 400 iu. sardines in oil drained 1. 75 ounces = 250 iu. tuna in oil drained 3 ounces = 200 iu. vitamin d fortified orange juice 1 cup = 142 iu. vitamin d fortified milk 1 cup = 98 iu. vitamin d fortified yogurts 6 ounces = 80 iu. egg yolk one = 20 iu. for comparison the usual amount of vitamin d in a multivitamin pill is 400 iu (international units).

Actual Doctor's Response:

you are wise to be concerned but take it one step further. insist that your boyfriend use a condom so that you are not exposed to any of his bodily fluids during sexual activity; oral or otherwise. oral sex is often a gateway activity to other more-risky sexual acts so set the parameters now. no condom no sex play. were you not aware that humans lie or omit the "whole truth"? while your boyfriend may be one of those rare young men who has honestly disclosed his past sexual activity do you think he would automatically disclose a one-night stand with someone else while you are dating? be wise! your risk may be minimal now but stds can be transmitted orally without ejaculation.

Patient Question:
how long should you wait to cast a broken ankle? is 8 days too long? . my 16 yr old son broke his ankle and the doctor waited 8 days for swelling to go down and on the 8th day follow up he said he needs a plate put it. is it because he wasnt casted?

Actual Doctor's Response:
not necessarily. we often wait a week or so before casting. if you put a snug cast on a freshly-injured area the cast will not fit properly when the swelling goes down and even worse. if the area started to swell more this could compromise the blood flow to the feet/toes. many will put the person in a special boot instead of a cast but that depends on the fracture. there are many types of ankle fracture; some are more stable than others. if your doctor feels that a plate is needed this may be because this fracture is unstable. because the ankle is a weight-bearing joint there are many considerations when it comes to managing these fractures. your son should be totally on crutches with no weight-bearing and hopefully he has not had subsequent injury in the last week since the original fracture was diagnosed (this can happen). a comparison x-ray may be required. hi there is no way we can tell you via the internet whether this treatment was appropriate or not as all injuries and people are different. here is some information on ankle injuries that may be helpful. if you feel like your son's treatment was not taken care of properly you may want to have another doctor examine him in person for a second opinion. the webmd answers staff

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer masturbation will not change the diameter or overall size of your penis. frequent ejaculation will decrease your sperm volume and sperm count but only temporarily. masturbation is considered safe but if you feel the need to masturbate 15 times per day you need to find another hobby. the most obvious effect is skin damage. i mean thing like chafing dryness soreness and even a loss of sensitivity. these all negatively impact one's sex life so you definitely should use a penis health creme every morning. these are made to protect the penis from masturbation-induced issues. they work very well. i use one called man1 man oil. you should check it out. hope this helps.

pepto-bismol (or pink bismuth) specifically is known to turn the tongue and/or stool black temporarily. this condition can persist for a few days after you take the product. the effect depends on how much pepto you took too. if the black stool goes away after a few days you probably have nothing to worry about. if it persists for more than a week you probably should see a health care provider. bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract (everything from your stomach to your rectum) can cause the stool to turn black. i'm going to assume however that the situation is temporary due to the use of pink bismuth. wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery!

the fda recommends that consumption of 1. 5 ounces of nuts per day may reduce cardiovascular risk. aside from the fatty acid composition of nuts other components such as arginine plant sterols and phenolic components may play a favorable role in the lowering of lipid levels for those who eat nuts as a regular part of their diet. walnuts and almonds have been most comprehensively studied. . one must always remember that these studies are far too small to establish any guidelines and there certainly is not one ounce of outcome data regarding the effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. the american dietetic association evidence library concludes that "consumption of 50-113 grams (1/2 cup to 1 cup) of nuts daily with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol decreased total cholesterol by 4-21% and ldl-c by 6-29% when weight was not gained. " however we have to remember that a diet rich in nuts is a heavy caloric load and may lead to weight gain. i recommend somewhat smaller portions of nuts as part of a healthful diet.

Patient Question:
my tsh is6. 66 and my t4 is 0. 84 after taking synthyroid 25mcg for 6 months what should i do?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your tsh result indicates you still have an underactive thyroid gland despite taking extra thyroid hormone (synthroid). the healthcare provider probably will be in touch with you to adjust your medication dosage. in the meantime you shouldn't do anything. you should never adjust your medications on your own. if you don't hear from the doctor who ordered your recent blood test be sure to call to make a follow-up appointment. the "reference range" for normal tsh values has been the subject of debate in recent years but a tsh level over 6. 0 clearly is high. this indicates the combination of thyroid pills plus the amount of thyroid hormone produced by your own thyroid gland still is low. don't worry. it can take quite some time to fine-tune the dosage of thyroid medication. and while a sluggish thyroid can be a nuisance it's not likely to have any life-threatening effects. wishing you well!

there is no correlation between contrast allergies and shellfish allergies. this is a myth that has persisted in the medical field since the 70's but is untrue. shellfish allergies are caused by a muscle protien in the shellfish (tropomyosin). you can't be allergic to iodine. it is in your body in your thyroid gland breast tissue and many other places. without iodine in your body you can not live.

Patient Question:
my daughter is 18 and for some reason she has been very tired and sluggish but very hungry what could be the problem? . when i cook at home i try and cook healthy food. though with her having a job and a car she has her own money and a way to get a lot of fast food. also since this cycle of hunger and sleepiness has occurred her body has been having pains off and on. are these related and could fast food be the problem?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the tiredness and aches and pains could be caused by a variety of factors. i would start with a physical and blood work. it is not uncommon for young women to be iron deficient which could be causing her to be tired. you also want to check her vitamin d levels which can be low even when diet is healthy. as for the pains its hard to tell. fast food daily would be a problem nutritionally but if she eats it less often it may not. some things you can do is talk to her about her food choices when eating out. and make a point to have family meals even if she gets home late let her know the food will be waiting and have one parent eat with her. your daughter is an adult now and it's time for her to take charge of her health. have her help prepare meals understand her nutritional needs and guide her to make good food choices. this article provides more information on diet for teens. good luck!

Patient Question:
how can exercise help my sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
so exercise and sleep there’s significant amount of data to show that a regular amount of exercise will help with sleep specifically increasing deep sleep. so one of the questions when we talk about working with the boomers and people who are in that age range is that if they can get daily exercise it will actually help increase their overall sleep. do you want to exercise right before bed? well that’s a great question and the data is very mixed on this. i have some patients who are what i call type-a personalities and pretty anxious folks. i actually have them exercising before bed which isn’t something that is usually recommended because for them exercise causes a relaxation response. so for them it’s perfect to exercise before bed. i have other patients people who are a little bit more melancholy and blue where exercise actually gives them energy so these people i have them exercising in the morning. so it really depends upon your overall personality type to know and understand when you should exercise. but overall i definitely recommend exercise for sleep.

how much light is in your bedroom is a major determining factor as to the quality of your sleep. the reason this is is because in the presence of light your brain will not produce melatonin. melatonin is one of the hormones that helps you fall asleep and stay asleep to get that good quality sleep. so if you’re in the presence of a significant amount of light you’re going to have a hard time being able to get good sleep. but what does that really mean? what that means is for practical purposes i have people switch the bulbs in their bedside table to 40 watt bulbs. or i have them install dimmer switches in their bedroom or i have them turn the dimmer switch on about an hour before bed. the thing that most people don’t realize is that sleep is not an on / off switch. it doesn’t work that way. sleep is more like slowly pulling your foot off the gas and pushing down on the brake. when the two pedals meet is when you fall asleep.

ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) used for temporary pain relief fever reduction and protection against swelling. in general ibuprofen also acts as a vasoconstrictor. ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed following administration and is rapidly distributed throughout the whole body. the excretion is rapid and complete via the kidneys. after complete excretion of ibuprofen it will no longer reduce pain fever or protect against affected area swelling. ibuprofen will not cure back problems. maximum plasma concentrations are reached 45 minutes after ingestion if taken on an empty stomach. when taken with food peak levels are observed after 1 to 2 hours. these times may vary with different dosage forms. the half-life of ibuprofen is about 2 hours.

Patient Question:
what causes back pain in pregnant women?

Actual Doctor's Response:
there are many possible reasons pregnant women may experience back or spinal pain. here are some of the more likely causes: weight gain. during a healthy pregnancy women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. this added weight must be supported by the spine which can result in discomfort in your lower back. further the weight of the growing baby and uterus puts pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back. changes in posture. as your uterus becomes heavier your center of gravity changes. you may gradually -- perhaps without noticing -- begin to adjust your posture and the way you move. this may result in back pain or strain. hormone changes. during pregnancy your body produces a hormone called relaxin that allows ligaments in the pelvic area to relax and the joints to become looser in preparation for the birth process. the same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to loosen leading to instability and pain. muscle separation. as the uterus expands two parallel sheets of muscles (the rectal abdominis muscles) which run from the rib cage to the pubic bone may separate along the center seam. this separation may worsen back pain. stress. emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back which may be felt as back pain or back spasms. you may find that you experience an increase in back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy.

i had sex august 23rd three days before my fertle window can i be pregnant he pulled out and cummed then put back in. he's 12 i'm 13. ? i had my period at 11. when should i take a test

Actual Doctor's Response:
yes it is possible you are pregnant. a female of any age is fertile and capable of getting pregnant if she has already had even one period. pulling out only stops the main ejaculation dear there is what is called "pre-ejaculate" that comes out before he has his main ejaculation which happens during orgasm. there can be sperm present in this pre-ejaculate and you can get pregnant from it. pre-ejaculate can come out anytime during sex before he orgasms and ejaculates fully. i'm not gonna tear you down and tell you what a bad girl you've been. you made a choice and now you have to figure it out. it's extremely important that you do the following two things. first you need to see a doctor. even if this boy says he has never had sex with anyone else he could be lying. people lie. boys lie even more frequently when sex is added to the equation. so you need to see a doctor and get an std test. std's just sounds like a scary word but we're talking about possibly life-threatening diseases that can kill you if left untreated. not to mention you could accidentally give them to someone else and hurt them. second you need to take precautions if you are going to continue to be sexually active. there is no excuse for a boy not to show up with condoms. if your boyfriend shows up without several condoms knowing full well you are going to have sex then you need to turn him away at the door and tell him to come back when he has some condoms. if he really cares about you he'll find a way to get some. they give them away for free all over the country. it's not hard. and you can go ahead and let him be responsible for that. it's his sperm that'll be causing any problems so he needs to get himself in order if he wants the privilege of your company. i'm sad that i have to tell you this but this is the world in which we live: you never let a boy con you or manipulate you into unprotected sex. and they will try. they will try every day until they realize you won't stop saying no. you must be responsible for your own body because no one else will be.

Patient Question:
what causes celiac disease?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the destruction of the inner lining of the small intestine in celiac disease is caused by an immunological (allergic) reaction to gluten in the diet that inflames and destroys the inner lining of the small intestine. there is evidence that this reaction is partially genetic and inherited. thus approximately 10% of first-degree relatives (parents siblings or children) of individuals with celiac disease also will have celiac disease. in addition in approximately 30% of fraternal twins and 70% of identical twins both twins will have celiac disease. finally certain genes have been found to be more common among individuals with celiac disease than among individuals without celiac disease. gluten is a family of proteins present in wheat. some of the proteins that make up gluten (the ones that are dissolved by alcohol) are called gliadin. it is the gliadin in gluten that causes the immunological reaction in celiac disease. the mechanism whereby gliadin becomes toxic (damaging) is not clear; however much scientific study is being done and we are beginning to understand the mechanism. proteins including gliadin are long chains of amino acids-up to several hundred--attached to each other. normally during digestion digestive enzymes within the small intestine break-up proteins into single amino acids and smaller chains of amino acids. this is necessary because the intestine only can absorb single amino acids or at most chains of 3-4 amino acids. single amino acids and chains of several amino acids do not cause problems for the intestine. it appears however that gliadin is not completely broken-up by intestinal enzymes. several longer chains of amino acids remain intact. somehow these larger chains enter the cells lining the intestine perhaps because the cells are abnormally permeable (leaky) to longer chains of amino acids. some of these longer chains are toxic (damaging) to the intestinal cells. one of the longer chains attaches to an enzyme within the cells tissue transglutaminase. in individuals with celiac disease the complex of the longer chain of amino acids and tissue transglutaminase sets off an immune reaction that attacks the complex and at the same time damages the intestinal cells. barley and rye contain gliadin-like proteins and can cause celiac disease in genetically-predisposed individuals. oats also contain gliadin-like proteins but unlike barley and rye the gliadin-like proteins in oats cause inflammation weakly and in only a few individuals who are predisposed to develop celiac disease. rice and corn do not cause celiac disease because they do not contain gliadin-like proteins.

although the exact cause of celiac disease is not known having certain genes increases your risk. you are more likely to have these genes and may get celiac disease if you have a first-degree relative (mother father brother sister son or daughter) with the condition. environmental factors such as viral or bacterial infections may trigger changes in the small intestine of a person with these genes. then eating foods that contain gluten can trigger an abnormal immune system response. eventually digestion and absorption problems may result. research continues on how genetic environmental and immune factors interact and affect a person's symptoms at what age they begin and whether long-term health problems develop. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

well my friend it sounds like you are constipated. and on top of that probably have a hemorrhoid yes. that would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement. while i applaud your devotion to greek yogurt i agree it's probably wise to cut back from 8-12 containers per day. eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation. if you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids. first you need to make sure you're drinking plenty of water each day. second eat a fiber-rich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods. in the short term you can take an over-the-counter stool softener (not laxative) such as docusate sodium. please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse. it's not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system. just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two. wishing you well! let me first start by saying i am not a doctor just your fellow webmd follower and i have had crohns disease for 12 years and know a little something about bowel movements. two important questions: my first question is: is the blood red or black? red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning. it either means you need to start drinking more water and/or taking stool softeners. you usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools. my next question would be: if the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor. this means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended. i suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside. again i hate to say it but see a doctor and/or stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will "balance" you. i had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid. my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked. <link>

based on a set of criteria a hga1c level between 5. 7-6. 4% is prediabetes. this means that there's an increased risk for developing overt diabetes. a person with prediabetes may have a normal blood sugar but only because their body has compensated for this with an increase in the amount of insulin produced. as prediabetes progresses the overproduction of insulin just won't be enough to compensate for high sugars and they become overtly abnormal and elevated. people with type 2 diabetes can have normal blood sugars but the metabolic abnormalities that occur will continue: insulin will continue to be produced in excess amounts. at some point it fails. and having either prediabetes or diabetes means your risk of heart disease is significantly above normal. you should modify the risks that you have: improved nutrition with calorie restriction and more fruits and veggies manage excess weight look for stress reduction methods and make good sleep a priority. seek help from a diabetes team. there are tons of information online and numerous organizations that help.

have you done anything to recolonized your intestines with good bacteria after killing all the old ones off? i'd try some greek yogurt also kefir sauerkraut and other probiotic foods. commercial probiotics help too but make sure you pick one with a wide range of helpful bacteria. also make sure you are drinking enough water. dark urine could mean kidney problems simple dehydration or malabsorption of nutrients from improper digestion of your food. if that doesn't help within a week or if you already have tried probiotic therapy this needs help from a doctor.

Patient Question:
can condoms cause the vaginal area to become red and swollen? . i just had sex for the first time with a condom. afterwards my lower vagina where the penis enters is now red and swollen. i have trouble going to the bathroom because it hurts so bad. i want to know what i can do to fix it without going to the doctor. but if i have to go i understand. tell me what is wrong and what i should do?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sex. especially for the first time. the redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen (assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time) burning on urination could be "cystitis" irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee (used to be called "honeymoon cystitis" back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex) or even a urinary tract infection. sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area -- and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection. germs can come from fingers mouths (oral sex) as well as a penis. now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adult-like decisions when it comes to your medical care. if you do have a urinary tract infection (burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe) this needs to be medically evaluated. a urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information. a pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosis. only a simple urine test. my suggestion would be for you to get checked. just in case. women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not. obviously infections are more common if you do have sex. i am pleased that you and your partner used a condom. make sure you use them 100% of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems.

not likely. gonorrhea is painful a man with lots of penile discharge and pain on urination. i don't think he could have tolerated it for six days let alone six years. chlamydia is not as painful but again it is very unlikely that he has had untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia for six years. my guess is that he has sexually contracted it recently even if he denies it. he may not want to truthfully disclose this information.

Actual Doctor's Response:
hello jean13. it's very good that you can reach out and talk about your issues. if you are way overweight then yes exercise is always recommended. but not always necessary in 2011 i was able to lose 70 lbs in less than 5 months by doing no exercise. a life changing experience helped me to learn the secret to weight loss and how to look at life for what it is. losing weight has to do with working less not working more. depending on how overweight you are you might not want to put too much pressure on a body that's already struggling with an amount of weight that's too much for your frame. losing weight is 100% mental. if you're mentally in it the body will follow and do its thing as long as you understand to get out of your own way. i also suffered from anxiety and depression. i beat the hell out it though. i had to take 47 pills a week. my condition got worse and worse. losing weight is about becoming aware of what you are not who you are or what others are saying or doing or what your occupation is. your body doesn't understand that stuff. trust me. i speak from experience not just reciting something i got off the internet tv or some crap story in the tabloids. i just got finished losing 15 lbs in a week and a half. no problem. i'm telling you that you're much more powerful than you think and much more powerful than you've been taught in school on tv in magazines or even in church. the greatest dietary supplements and pharmacy on the planet is already in you. it's just waiting for you to throw the switches. you are divine. know it! you are a product of nature not something that's owned by a corporation. be your own president. i'm always here if you need anything answered or just need to talk. i would like to know how much you weigh or how much you need to lose if you don't mind. keep your head up and have a glorious logical day!

hi try this below its a post of mine this should really help you as it will clean you blood up plaque build up will do this to you. and this will help you kick out both drugs. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonfuls each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. don’t forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on. one last piece of info some cp i got out here in greece was not very hot so changed shops and using a 50/50 mix of cp and chilli powder this i put a heaped teaspoon on top each day along with a heaped teaspoon of turmeric now from a site i’m on they say to help turmeric get absorbed to take a ¼ teaspoon of black pepper with it what a great way to light a fire in your stomach to get the day started.

hi when shbg levels are increased beyond what is expected there is likely to be less free testosterone available to the tissues than is indicated by the total testosterone. this could lead to poor libido in men. males: 10-57 nmol/l in men aged 70-89 years modulation of androgen action may occur via an age-related increase in shbg and reduction in free testosterone without a decline in total testosterone concentration. increasing age bmi and lh are independently associated with lower free testosterone. further investigation would be required to assess the clinical consequences of low serum free testosterone particularly in older men in whom total testosterone may be preserved. ok so far so good then i think it works this way your shbg is 118 which is double what it should be this affects your testosterone and lowers it so hence ed has your doctor offered you anything to raise it back up yet? if not you could try some dhea it’s a hormone this helps raise you testosterone lift your libido and kick up you energy levels but get your wife to keep an eye on you? it can give the odd person some funny side effects. and with this you could take some tribulus this works along the same lines they work together so would help the dhea but this is up to you how you go this is just a suggestion. i’m on both daily for ed and a whole load of other things that seem to work for my ed and i’m 67. good luck

Patient Question:
when signing up for health insurance in the exchange what happens to families with mixed eligibility?

Actual Doctor's Response:
one of the most important aspects of the state insurance exchange is that there is “no wrong door” to find appropriate coverage. when you apply your application will determine your family’s eligibility for medicaid chip and exchange subsidies. states determine eligibility for medicaid based on household income. if you qualify for medicaid in your state you cannot qualify for a subsidy on the exchange. subsidy eligibility on the health insurance exchanges depends upon your household income and its relation to the federal poverty level (fpl). if your household earns between 100-400 percent of the fpl that corresponds to the size of your family you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange. for a single person in 2013 the 100-400 percent fpl income range is $11 490 to $45 960. in some cases for example children may qualify for chip whereas the parents qualify for exchange subsidies. in all cases your state health insurance exchange should lead you to the “right door” for coverage.

Actual Doctor's Response:
what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about 2 capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you

the short answer is yes and no. yes she can get pregnant from pre-cum and no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends. the long answer is as follows: using a condom and/or birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby. most health departments will offer both at little to no cost. if it is true that her period ended on friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant day after pill or not. sperm can live for 24-72 hours in the female body. most will die off en-route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm. a woman's cycle works like this. period starts and triggers a turn of events. the lh phase is the phase when her body is not fertile typically 10-16 days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle. then the fertile days come in to play. for about 4-5 days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant. once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy. i would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month. mostly because i don't see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should. at least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant. it can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy. please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a 'normal' cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period. this information comes from personal experience with tracking my own cycle to achieve pregnancy which i have done successfully. best of luck to you both!

Patient Question:
how can i build white blood cells with food?

Actual Doctor's Response:
simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.

i'm glad you asked because many others will benefit. you should be just fine taking this combination of medications. you may feel drowsier than normal. and anyone who is taking a narcotic (hydrocodone) should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions. in general though you're not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages. in the future i'd recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time you're prescribed a narcotic. also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice. i hope your ankle heals quickly! it is definitely safe. you want to be careful to see how they interact with each other at a time when you can lay down if necessary. i take four 1 mg xanax a day and two 7. 5/325 mg of norco (hydrocodone) everyday. make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications.

treatments vary among urologists and are tailored to the type of prostatitis you have. correct diagnosis is crucial and treatments vary. it's important to make sure your symptoms are not caused by urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) or some other condition that may lead to permanent bladder or kidney damage. treatments can include: anti-inflammatory medicines along with warm sitz baths (sitting in two to three inches of warm water). this is the most conservative treatment for chronic prostatitis. antibiotic medicine for infectious prostatitis. these drugs are not effective treatments for noninfectious prostatitis. for acute infectious prostatitis patients usually need to take antibiotic medicine for 14 days. almost all acute infections can be cured with this treatment. for chronic infectious prostatitis antibiotic medicine is taken for a longer period of time usually four to 12 weeks. about 75% of all cases of chronic infectious prostatitis clear up with this treatment. for cases that don't taking antibiotics at a low dose for a long time may be recommended to relieve the symptoms. pain medications. muscle relaxants. surgical removal of the infected portions of the prostate. a doctor may advise this treatment for severe cases of chronic prostatitis or for men whose swollen prostate is blocking the flow of urine. supportive therapies for chronic prostatitis including stool softeners and prostate massage. other treatments for chronic noninfectious prostatitis include the use of the alpha blocker drugs such as hytrin and cardura. these drugs relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow and decrease symptoms. other drugs that lower hormone levels such as proscar may help to shrink the prostate gland in some men. some people may benefit from avoiding spicy foods and caffeinated or acidic drinks. activities that aggravate the condition such as bicycling may need to be eliminated as well. many cases of abacterial (nonbacterial) prostatitis (also considered chronic pelvic pain syndrome) respond to a mix of treatments that include exercise myofascial trigger point release progressive relaxation and counseling. prostatitis is a treatable disease. even if the problem cannot be cured you can usually get relief from your symptoms by following the recommended treatment. be sure to follow the full course any prescription you are given even if you no longer have any symptoms. with infectious prostatitis for example the symptoms may disappear before the infection has completely cleared.

you should always be concerned when you have unprotected sex. the risk of an std is not worth the worry so why not just use condoms and protect yourself? your symptoms could indicate a yeast infection since itching is a primary symptom but there is really no way of knowing if you have contracted other stds unless you were properly examined and tested. it is sooooo much easier to use condoms.

genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on your medical history and a physical exam. your doctor may ask you the following questions: do you think you were exposed to genital herpes or another sexually transmitted disease ( std )? how do you know? did your partner tell you? what are your symptoms? do you have sores in the genital area or anywhere else on your body? do they usually come and go? do you have any urinary symptoms including frequent urination burning or stinging with urination or urinating in small amounts? if you have discharge from the vagina or penis it is important to note any smell or color. what method of birth control do you use? did you use condoms to protect against stds? which high-risk sexual behaviors do you or your partner engage in? have you had an std in the past? how was it treated? after the medical history is taken: a woman will have a gynecological exam. a pap test is not specific for genital herpes but may be included depending on the woman's medical history. a man will have a genital exam to check for hsv infection. your doctor may be able to diagnose genital herpes from your medical history and physical exam especially if the herpes sores are typical in appearance. but if this is your first outbreak of suspected genital herpes further testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis. herpes tests cannot always show if you have a primary genital herpes outbreak or you have been infected in the past. sometimes a test result can be negative even though the person has herpes. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

when you see a doctor about acne you'll have a physical exam and your doctor will ask about your medical history. women may be asked questions about their menstrual cycles. this information can help your doctor find out if hormones are playing a role in acne flare-ups. most often you won't have any special tests to diagnose acne. you may need other tests if your doctor suspects that acne is a symptom of another medical problem (such as higher-than-normal amounts of testosterone in a woman). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i love this question. admittedly i don't share your belief that society will collapse and leave us without prescription medications. however i am fascinated with the concepts of wilderness survival and survival themes in general. luckily do-it-yourself thyroid replacement is not impossible. it's not easy but it's not impossible. the original thyroid replacement hormone has been around for over a century. it consists of dessicated pig thyroid. you could make this yourself by harvesting the thyroid gland of a pig slicing it thinly then drying and crushing it into a powder. of course there would be no good way to determine the dosage of homemade dessicated pig thyroid. you would simply have to monitor yourself for symptoms of high or low thyroid levels. strong disclaimer: i am in no way suggesting anyone should attempt to make or use their own dessicated pig thyroid capsules. doing so could cause injury or even death due to contamination among other things. the information above is offered purely for entertainment and information purposes. good luck!

Actual Doctor's Response:
i am so very sorry to hear about the loss of your sister and her baby. my condolences to you and your entire family. i admire your willingness to write a paper on the very topic that took your sister's life. i think that takes a lot of strength and courage. to answer your question. a pulmonary embolism is caused when all or part of a blood clot breaks loose in a vein travels to the lungs and blocks a major artery there. usually a small part of a much larger clot (or " thrombus ") breaks off and causes the embolism. we know these large clots usually occur in leg veins so the medical examiner probably opened up the femoral vein and saw the remaining portion of the large clot still residing within the vein. that is how he or she knew where the clot came from. in a living person it can sometimes be impossible to determine where an embolism-causing clot came from. many people with blood clots in their legs have no symptoms. i hope you find this answer useful. good luck with your paper!

Actual Doctor's Response:
an important risk factor is age; more than 70 percent of men diagnosed with this disease are over the age of 65. african american men have a substantially higher risk of prostate cancer than white men including hispanic men. dramatic differences in the incidence of prostate cancer are also seen in different populations around the world. there is some evidence that dietary factors are involved such as vitamin e and selenium which may have a protective effect. genetic factors also appear to play a role particularly for families in which the diagnosis is made in men under age 60. the risk of prostate cancer rises with the number of close relatives who have the disease.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it is normal to feel sick for a day or two when you have acute pharyngitis. the nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick. try to eat something if you can -- anything. but if you can't keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know. you don't want to become dehydrated. also if you're not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call. several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so that's something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on.

your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal. i believe that your anxiety is really fear. anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions. anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety. but there are differences. anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat. an example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid. fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat. for example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says “stick them up”. now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful. that lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear. once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside. until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion. enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun. i hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored.

Model's Recommendation:

premenstrual yeast infections are fairly common. the timing has been attributed to either a slight blunting of immune function at this time in the cycle or ph changes. (menstrual flow is alkaline and the good vaginal bacterias prefer a more acidic environment. ) yet in your specific case you mention using both an over the counter treatment (hopefully one with a truly active ingredient such as miconazole or clotrimazole) and prescription difulcan tablets. frequent/recurrent yeast infections that do not respond to any of the prescribed treatments suggest a couple of possibilities. first that yeast is not the culprit or second that it is one of the atypical subtypes of yeast ("candida"). the easiest way to help unravel this question is to have the gyn do a yeast culture the next time you have symptoms. if the culture is negative then yeast is not the cause. some other conditions which can produce yeast type symptoms include: 1. cytolytic vaginitis--this is an overgrowth of the beneficial hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacili that help keep the vagina clear of undesirable bacteria. an overgrowth can produce an itchy burning irritating discharge. 2. lichen sclerosus--this is a skin condition outside the vagina (usually between the vaginal opening and the anus) that can create intense itching and irritation. 3. contact dermatitis--this would be from a change in tampons/pads new bubble bath etc. if the yeast culture is positive then the lab can identify which of the yeast subtypes may be the villain. most yeast medications are developed for candida albicans --about 80% of yeast infections are due to this. the other 20% or so are uncommon subtypes (e. g. candid glabrata). to treat the less common subtypes clinicians may try boric acid vaginally or even painting with a gentian violet (very messy! ). if these are truly reoccurances of candida albicans you might need repeat or prolonged treatments. a blood sugar or hemoglobin a 1c test can be considered. if you have ever had someone give you oral sex (or you use saliva for masturbation) you may be getting exposure to yeast. yeast is present in the gut from the mouth to the rectum. you can certainly try the so called lifestyle treatments for yeast. additional lifestyle methods which have been advocated for "yeast infection prevention " include: a diet low in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates avoidance of tight jeans use of cotton underwear eating natural lactobacillus yogurt and others. there are few if any good research studies which demonstrate that these methods are helpful but some women swear by them. bottom line although it's more expensive a yeast/candida culture may help find a diagnosis and direct treatment if this pattern persists. hi if you live near the sea try swimming at times your having a yeast problem if not just simple get some sea salt sprinkle some into a warm bath when its dissolved just get into it at let it do its work let the water get inside you you can google yeast infection sea salt bath lots of info. good luck omg! i have been battling the same problem for years and just this last month i think i found the cure i started a whole 30 clean eating challenge with the group at my gym and this is the first time i do not get one! i urge you guys to try this food challenge. it really all comes down to what we eat and how this is playing a roll with our hormones. hope this helps someone!

Patient Question:
how is paget's disease diagnosed?

Actual Doctor's Response:
paget's disease is diagnosed based on the x-ray appearance. paget's disease might also be detected with other imaging tests such as a bone scan mri scan and ct scan. alkaline phosphatase an enzyme that comes from bone is frequently elevated in the blood of people with paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. this blood test is also referred to as the serum alkaline phosphatase (sap) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of paget's disease. the bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. bone that is affected by paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9928
the treatment of paget's disease is directed toward controlling the disease activity and managing its complications. when paget's disease causes no symptoms and blood testing shows that the level of serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or minimally elevated no treatment may be necessary. bone pain can require anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or pain-relieving medications. bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear. surgical operations may be necessary for damaged joints fractures severely deformed bones or when nerves are being pinched by enlarged bone. prior to undergoing an operation on bone affected by paget's disease it is helpful to be treated with medications such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin (miacalcin) as this tends to diminish the risk of surgical complications including bleeding. the medical treatment of the bone of paget's disease involves either medications called bisphosphonates or injectable calcitonin. these drugs are also used to treat certain patients with osteoporosis. bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment. there are a number of these available that are taken by mouth including alendronate (fosamax) risedronate (actonel) etidronate (didronel) and tiludronate (skelid) and that are administered intravenously including pamidronate (aredia) and zoledronate (reclast). in general oral bisphosphonates are taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with 8 ounces of water. they can cause irritation of the stomach and esophagus. intravenous bisphosphonates can cause temporary muscle and joint pain but are not associated with irritation of the stomach or esophagus.

i have to tell you that i think it's doubtful your sjogren's syndrome symptoms were triggered by going off birth control pills. sjogren's is an autoimmune disorder that most commonly affects white women in their 40s and 50s. if you're menopausal you're right in the age range for developing sjogren's. while a hormonal link is being studied with regard to sjogren's syndrome this has not yet been established. like menopause sjogren's can trigger vaginal dryness. going on some type of hormone replacement therapy may help with that symptom but it probably won't do any good for other symptoms such as dry mouth and dry eyes. the medical professional who diagnosed you with sjogren's syndrome can help you with medications to treat the specific symptoms you're experiencing. i hope this helps!

how long does it take to develop a resistance to an antibiotic?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it depends on how much is being used and how often bacteria are exposed to the drug. it's related to the volume of use and the ability of bacteria to change their coat of armor. it can happen in months; it can happen in weeks or even over a period of years. it usually takes longer for resistance to become widespread but with an increase in travel we can transport bacteria within hours to another location.

you ask a great question and i wish i had a great answer. there is no product that can thicken up your skin so that you don't bruise as easily. sorry. of course you can use makeup to cover up some bruises but realistically speaking it's not that feasible to wear makeup on your hands and arms. obviously the regular use of blood-thinning agents like aspirin or ibuprofen can increase bruising but don't stop taking aspirin if your doctor told you to take it for heart health. some products can cause the skin to become thinner like topical corticosteroids. avoid using these products unless absolutely necessary. in the privacy of your home you may wish to start wearing gloves more frequently. gloves can act like an extra layer of skin and protect you from getting bruised due to a minor bump or scrape. you may want to consult a dermatologist to learn if there are any new products or treatments to address the issue of paper-thin skin and easy bruising. wishing you well!

Patient Question:
how is the common cold spread?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the common cold is spread either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after individuals sneeze or cough. person-to-person transmission often occurs when an individual who has a cold blows or touches their nose and then touches someone or something else. a healthy individual who then makes direct contact with these secretions can subsequently become infected often after their contaminated hands make contact with their own eyes or nose. a cold virus can live on objects such as pens books telephones computer keyboards and coffee cups for several hours and can thus be acquired from contact with these objects.

there is no cure for the common cold. the common cold is a self-limited illness that will resolve spontaneously with time. home remedies and treatments are directed at alleviating the symptoms associated with the common cold while the body fights off the infection. home treatment for the common cold includes getting rest and drinking plenty of fluids. in older children and adults over-the-counter medications such as throat lozenges throat sprays cough drops and cough syrups may help relieve symptoms though they will not prevent or shorten the duration of the common cold. gargling with warm saltwater may help those with a sore throat. decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (sudafed) or antihistamines may be used for nasal symptoms while saline nasal sprays may also be beneficial. it is important to note that over-the-counter medications may cause undesirable side effects therefore they must be taken with care. acetaminophen (tylenol and others) and ibuprofen (advil motrin) can help with fever sore throat and body aches. the treatment for infants and small children with the common cold is supportive as well. it is especially important to allow rest and encourage plenty of fluids in order to prevent dehydration. nasal drops and bulb suctioning may be used to clear nasal mucus in infants. medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be taken for pain or fever based on the package recommendations for age and weight. do not use aspirin or aspirin-containing medications in children or teenagers because it has been associated with a rare potentially fatal condition called reye's syndrome. finally over-the-counter cough and cold medications for infants and children are not recommended (see warning below). warning: the united states food and drug administration (fda) recommends that over-the-counter cough and cold medications not be used in children younger than 4 years of age because serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur.

albuterol is a bronchodilator used typically for asthma and a reactive airway. if the cause of your wife's cough is due to asthma or an allergic disorder then yes it may help. albuterol is not a cough suppressant however. knowing the cause of the cough is always important when determining how to treat it. a cough due to a cold (very common) is from post-nasal drainage so the cough is beneficial since it helps clear the airway. a cough due to allergies can be very irritation so an antihistamine may help. suppressing a cough is considered controversial but often helpful if the cough interferes with sleep. a teaspoon or two of honey can help or if you are looking for an over-the-counter suppressant one containing dextromethorophan (dm) is often helpful. a cough can also be a sign of a lung infection so if any cough persists especially one that is accompanied by chest pain fever or productive of thick mucous should be carefully evaluated by a medical provider. have her drink lots of water and humidify the air she breathes (a cool mist humidifier). all of these things will help quiet a cough.

Patient Question:
i have an ankle severe ankle sprain unable to walk on it it is red swollen and hot to the touch very painfull why?

Actual Doctor's Response:
well that's a good question. have you had your ankle examined by a health care professional or are you diagnosing this as a sprain on your own? because your symptoms could be caused by a sprain for sure but also by a fracture (break) in the ankle or the leg. so i'd recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to have the ankle examined. your health care provider may want to take an x-ray to make sure nothing is broken. the symptoms you describe can be a normal part of the body's healing process. when we injure tissue the body sends a big healing response to the damaged area. various cells march into action and these can cause the tissue to temporarily become hot and swollen. the pain is caused by nerves that have been irritated or injured. with any injury like the one you're describing we recommend you elevate the injured area and apply ice packs. do not place ice packs directly against the skin; use a towel or something in between. the usual recommendation is 20 minutes of ice then 20 minutes with no ice. however i again want to caution you to get examined by a doctor to make sure you haven't broken or dislocated a bone. so sorry you're hurting! i hope you get some relief soon!

Patient Question:
how does an overdose of acetaminophen cause liver injury?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the answer is that liver damage from acetaminophen occurs when the glutathione pathway is overwhelmed by too much of acetaminophen's metabolite napqi. then this toxic compound accumulates in the liver and causes the damage. furthermore alcohol and certain medications such as phenobarbital phenytoin (dilantin) or carbamazepine (tegretol) (anti-seizure medications) or isoniazid (inh nydrazid laniazid) an anti-tuberculosis drug can significantly increase the damage. they do this by making the cytochrome p-450 system in the liver more active. this increased p-450 activity results in an increased formation of napqi from the acetaminophen. additionally chronic alcohol use as well as the fasting state or poor nutrition can each deplete the liver's glutathione. so alcohol both increases the toxic compound and decreases the detoxifying material. accordingly the bottom line in an acetaminophen overdose is that when the amount of napqi is too much for the available glutathione to detoxify liver damage occurs.

Similarity Score: 0.9646
when there is too much cholesterol in your blood it builds up in the walls of your arteries. over time this buildup causes the arteries to harden -- a process called atherosclerosis. the arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked. the blood carries oxygen to the heart and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart you may suffer chest pain. if the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a sudden blockage the result is a heart attack. there are two forms of cholesterol that most americans are familiar with: low-density lipoprotein (ldl or "bad" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (hdl or "good" cholesterol). these are the forms in which cholesterol travels in the blood. ldls have little protein and high levels of cholesterol and hdl has a lot of protein and very little cholesterol. ldl is the main source of artery clogging plaque. hdl actually works to clear cholesterol from the blood. triglycerides are another fat in our bloodstream. research is now showing that high levels of triglycerides are also linked to heart disease.

it’s difficult to determine causation/correlation in this instance. some studies have shown that there may be a correlation between creatine and high blood pressure but there may not be enough evidence yet to support causation. a function of creatine is that it can withhold water in your muscles; and having more water in your body can raise blood pressure. for this reason diuretics (water pills) for example are commonly prescribed to alleviate high blood pressure by eliminating excess water and sodium from your body. accordingly it makes sense to think that creatine could raise blood pressure. i would encourage the individuals that you speak with to discontinue supplement use while monitoring any changes in their blood pressure. there can be many factors that influence blood pressure but if they discontinue supplement use and don’t notice any change in blood pressure after some time then creatine may not be the culprit. regardless if they already have high blood pressure supplementation is not recommended because both creatine and high blood pressure can cause kidney problems. excess protein in your diet can also cause kidney problems as well. it may just be prudent to discontinue supplement use altogether as long as their blood pressure isn't within normal limits. of course i would always encourage that you suggest that they speak with their doctor first before taking any supplements. my response is also just for learning purposes and is not meant to replace medical advice from a physician. read more about creatine here.

serotonin is a neurotransmitter in the brain that scientists have found to be related to fibromyalgia. neurotransmitters are brain chemicals that send specific messages from one brain cell to another. while only a small percentage of all serotonin -- 1% to 2% -- is located in the brain this neurotransmitter is believed to play a vital role in mediating moods. studies have found that too much stress can lead to permanently low levels of serotonin. that in turn can create aggression. an increased level of serotonin in the brain is associated with a calming anxiety-reducing effect. in some cases it's also associated with drowsiness. a stable serotonin level in the brain is associated with a positive mood state or feeling good over a period of time. lack of exercise and inactivity can aggravate low serotonin levels.

diagnosis of cataracts is based on a medical history and physical exam. often tests are used to: confirm the presence of a cataract. rule out other conditions that may be causing vision loss. for more information see the topics vision tests ophthalmoscopy and tonometry. in deciding whether to have surgery it can be very helpful to evaluate the effect that vision loss from a cataract has on your life. your doctor may ask you to complete a questionnaire regarding the effect of the cataract on daily activities. if you already have some vision loss that cannot be corrected by cataract surgery your doctor may perform a low-vision evaluation to help find ways for you to make the most of your remaining vision and maintain your quality of life. early detection during routine eye exams your eye doctor will look for early signs of vision problems including cataracts. testing your child for cataracts may be needed if you think your child is having a vision problem. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

how do i know if im pregnant if im only 16. i have white stuff that comes out of me and im always tired now.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you are sexually involved and not using any form of birth control it is only a matter of time before you will become pregnant. a white discharge and fatigue is not a definitive sign of pregnancy. if you are worried get a pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an exam. if you don't want to be pregnant now then you certainly know how to prevent it. either don't have sex. or use an effective form of birth control.

Patient Question:
how can my “attitude” about my bedroom affect my sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
your brain actually can train you to have specific emotional feelings surrounding a room in the house. and the bedroom you have to remember is a very private place but it’s also a safety issue so for example in cases where women have been raped or beaten they get almost phobic usually occurring in the bedroom almost phobic to the bedroom. alright i’ve worked with women in rape crisis centers before and they are afraid to go to sleep okay because of the things that happened to them during their sleep. so again can it happen? absolutely it can. can you get a bit milder case where we don’t have such extreme horrible circumstances can people argue in bed and get used to arguing in bed. you know what i tell people don’t have big emotional discussions in your bed if you can help it. don’t talk about your kids in bed don’t talk about your bills in bed. reserve the bed for sleep sex if you can and you know maybe evening watching a little tv reading things of that nature.

well i think when you start having symptoms such as you can’t go to sleep at night because every time you put your head down on the pillow you’re constantly thinking of what you have to do or what you didn’t do or what you did wrong. symptoms of anxiety: sleep problems irritability lack of concentration memory issues problems at work ill at ease jumpy eating changes it’s interfering with your ability to relate to others; it’s causing irritable kinds of things you’re irritable where you never really would be irritable you’re finding that your short tempered you can’t handle things you’re having problems concentrating you really feel like you can’t remember some things and that is kind of scaring you. you’re having problems doing your job meeting your deadlines. you never are at ease you always feel as if there is something that has to be done you’re jumpy about things you may have eating changes you may you know some it’s very interesting some people eat an awful lot when they are stressed and they gain weight so we say to people sometimes they don’t know if they’ve gained weight so we say is your clothing a little tighter now and other people they lose their appetite entirely they lose weight. so we look for weight changes sleep changes mood changes. we also look for things like stomachache chronic headache okay feeling maybe very very sweaty hands things like that inability to sit still and just enjoy being quiet for a little bit. you find that you can’t do that. that’s something that you’re not allowed to give to yourself. isn’t that a terrible thing?

you left out a very important fact: the age of your son. if a child was under three to six months old we take any fever quite serious but if the child is older fever rarely gets the attention of a seasoned medical provider. why? because fever is not dangerous even in the 105 range. it is the body's normal response to fighting off an illness (in kids this is usually a virus). you do not have to rush him to the hospital with a temperature of 102. 3 unless you enjoy sitting for hours in a crowded er while other patients go in front of him. you are not unusual in your fear of fever. fever is one of the most normal yet least understood symptoms. relax. fever is higher in the evening; lower in the morning so it always goes up and down. whether you try to reduce it with acetaminophen or ibuprofen will not really help the illness but it will make him feel better. even though fever is not dangerous it does make a child feel yucky so it is okay to treat for comfort. the real issue is not the fever but the cause of the fever. your son should be examined to see if a biological cause can be determined. you can take him to an urgent care facility or just call his pediatrician for patient-specific advice. not knowing your son's age this answer is the best i can do for you.

it has been in the news lately and the reason why is because children were getting multiple different types of medications not intentionally and were exactly following the directions. the parents were kind of like well i need to go to work and i need to get my child to school. so they're giving them all these different types of medicines not realizing that some of them contain the same ingredients. children were becoming very tired they were having different types of reactions and actually some children did end up in the emergency room. the labeling and directions have actually been revised and now most products are not recommended for use in children under four. so as a parent when you come into the pharmacy ask the pharmacist if they can assist you in making sure you're choosing the right product. the pharmacist is going to ask you a lot of questions including what is your child's weight? we are finding out more and more that these medications need to be dosed on the child's weight rather than their age. also when you get a dropper or spoon that comes with the medication you want to keep those together. that spoon was specifically designed for that medication to make sure your child receives the right dose. read the labels. the labels may have tylenol cough and cold but it is going to contain some products other than just tylenol. then you might go to a robitussin type of product which may contain the same thing as well. make sure everyone in the house is aware of what you might be giving your child to help their cough or cold. sometimes we have nannies or grandparents that come over and say oh i'm going to give him some medication. well make sure everyone knows when the last time the medication was given what was given and keep track of it. sometimes also the best medication is no medication at all. we might want it to run its course or it may just require something like a simple nasal drop or running a vaporizer at night. it's as simple as that. but we really want to keep this in mind we want to be safe we want to make sure that parents understand that. there are lot of questions around this topic. ask your pharmacist or the medication experts we'll be more than happy to help you with this.

i am 45 and had my right fallopian tube removed due to multiple ectopic pregnancies is it possible to get pregnant. how often will i ovulate with only one fallopian tube

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer hi found you this on barycentre. com it could help or not? you ovulate from both sides if you have both ovaries. usually one side one month the other side the next but sometimes an ovary is the dominate ovary and does more then 50-50 (so you can't judge which side you'll ovulate on which is what i thought). one ovary could ovulate 8 times a year while the other only does 4 times a year. so if your good tube has the non-dominant ovary you could only get pregnant 4 times a year (or however many times it ovulates a year- from one to 12 times). the opposite tube can catch the egg but it's not likely. i only have one tube and conceived my son the first month we were trying. and from what i can read also seems that the right one is the more dominant one of the two which would not help you. you would just have to track your ovulation dates and make sure you have unprotected sex 4 days before reason its takes male sperm 3 days to get into the right place to receive your egg so 4 days means there sitting there waiting and sperm can live for up to 5 7 or 10 days depending where you read. hope this helps you. good luck

how often to feed a 5 month old dry cereal

Actual Doctor's Response:
please do not feed a 5-month old infant anything besides milk (breast or bottle) yet. the american academy of pediatricians recommends giving an infant milk only for the first six months. and when you do start your baby on cereal we're not talking regular cereal like cheerios. you need to feed your baby soft wet baby cereal. you'll find it in the baby food aisle. not only is your baby's digestive system not ready to handle "dry cereal" at five months of age but giving an infant "dry" anything can be a choking hazard. after your baby is safely taking baby cereal you can begin introducing jarred baby food. introduce just one new food at a time and keep a watch for any allergic reaction. most babies tolerate baby food just fine but if you notice signs of a rash after feeding your infant baby food you should not feed it again until you check with your pediatrician. if you have other questions about how and when to feed your baby please visit the webmd newborn & baby community. you may also want to check out this slideshow on what to feed your baby. (note the slideshow says you can introduce baby food/cereal at 4 months of age but i disagree with that advice. you can't go wrong by waiting. ) wishing you and baby well!

the short answer is: yes. unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes. it doesn't matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion "barely touched" your penis. a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it's not active. your girlfriend's herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion. this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you're flirting with disaster. you need to take better precautions in the future. there is no cure for genital herpes. if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them. they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you. and while condom use is good be aware a condom won't necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that aren't covered by the sheath. i'm not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner. even if you're not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story. please stop engaging in unsafe sex. always use a condom. don't have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease. you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices. wishing you well!

Actual Doctor's Response:
the risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include: gender. gallstones form more commonly in women than men. age. gallstone prevalence increases with age. obesity. obese people are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. pregnancy. women who have been pregnant are more likely to form gallstones than women who have not been pregnant. pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy bile contains more cholesterol and the gallbladder does not contract normally. birth control pills and hormone therapy the increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. rapid weight loss. rapid weight loss by whatever means very low calorie diets or obesity surgery causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost but many do not. moreover until they are gone they may cause problems. crohn's disease. individuals with crohn's disease of the terminal ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. gallstones form because patients with crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. normally bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body in the terminal ileum and are secreted again by the liver into bile. in other words the bile acids recycle. in crohn's disease the terminal ileum is diseased. bile acids are not absorbed normally the body becomes depleted of bile acids and less bile acids are secreted in bile. there are not enough bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile and gallstones form. increased blood triglycerides. gallstones occur more frequently in people with elevated blood triglyceride levels. risk for pigment gallstones black pigment gallstones form whenever there is an increased load of bilirubin that reaches the liver. this occurs whenever there is increased destruction of red blood cells as there is in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. black pigment gallstones also are more common among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow) for example when there are narrow obstructed bile ducts.

how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me? can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time? . how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair?

Actual Doctor's Response:
this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there. so i will try to address all of them for you. first of all the sooner you start using the products; whether it's rogaine and/or propecia the better off you are because it's much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards. so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed; whether it's in the temple area or in the crown that's when you start going. the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone. so it doesn't become like one and one is two it's more like one and one is four or five. so they are that much better together. it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them. so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point.

Patient Question:
what is pneumonia?

Actual Doctor's Response:
pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs which is usually caused by bacteria viruses or fungi. prior to the discovery of antibiotics one-third of all people who developed pneumonia subsequently died from the infection. currently over 3 million people develop pneumonia each year in the united states. over a half a million of these people are admitted to a hospital for treatment. although most of these people recover approximately 5% will die from pneumonia. pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in the united states.

pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs. usually the inflammation is caused by an infection but it can also be caused by breathing certain chemical fumes. it's a more common problem than most people think. usually pneumonia is a mild disease but some forms are very dangerous. in all cases you'll need a doctor's advice. pneumonia can affect just one lobe of the right or left lung a whole lung or both lungs many different kinds of germs infect the lungs and cause pneumonia. infected lungs leak fluids and shed dead cells. this material clogs up air sacs and makes it hard for the lungs to do their job of getting oxygen into the blood. without enough oxygen none of the cells in your body work as they should. pneumonia generally lasts about two weeks. even healthy people may feel tired or weak for a month or more after the lungs clear up.

well this is an excellent question for your health care provider. i'd suggest you make an appointment as soon as possible with your primary care provider to discuss what's going on. many conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing. to receive a diagnosis you need to be examined by someone who can provide ongoing care. if you had testing done at an emergency room find out if your doctor can access the test results electronically (by computer). if not you'll need to have the results sent to his or her office. unfortunately this isn't something that can diagnosed in a forum like this. but i do wish you all the best in finding resolution to your problem!

Patient Question:
what are the risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. "stretch marks " you might be thinking "why would that be? " the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks.

Patient Question:
what are complications of hypothyroidism?

Actual Doctor's Response:
untreated hypothyroidism may cause: heart problems infertility joint pain obesity thyroid problems in a pregnant woman can affect the developing baby. during the first three months of pregnancy the baby receives all thyroid hormone from its mother. if the mother has hypothyroidism the baby does not get enough thyroid hormone. this can lead to problems with mental development. extremely low levels of thyroid hormone can cause a life-threatening condition called myxedema. myxedema is the most severe form of hypothyroidism. a person with myxedema can lose consciousness or go into a coma. the condition can also cause the body temperature to drop very low which can cause death.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 0.9836
the symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. they are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to aging. patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. the symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. common symptoms are listed below: fatigue. depression. modest weight gain. cold intolerance. excessive sleepiness. dry coarse hair. constipation. dry skin. muscle cramps. increased cholesterol levels. decreased concentration. vague aches and pains. swelling of the legs. as the disease becomes more severe there may be puffiness around the eyes a slowing of the heart rate a drop in body temperature and heart failure. in its most profound form severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). in a severely hypothyroid individual a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness surgery stress or traumatic injury. this condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection. properly diagnosed hypothyroidism can be easily and completely treated with thyroid hormone replacement. on the other hand untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) worsening heart failure and an accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion).

let me share three elements that i’ll bet you didn’t realize impact so significantly upon childhood obesity. . 1. tv in the bedroom: having a tv in the bedroom often leads to sedentary behavior as well as overeating. kids literally go into a trance for hours staring at the tube while mindlessly stuffing their faces with too many calories which includes a large amount of junk. get these tvs out of their bedrooms! 2. not sitting down together for meals: few families sit down together for a meal especially at dinnertime. kids frequently fend for themselves and often take their food to other parts of the house and eat there. how about parents mentor their kids and structure meals such that there’s time to sit and talk and enjoy healthy food together? heck prepare the meal together! it’s such a win-win. 3. not getting enough sleep: sleep deprivation goes hand in hand with the tv in the bedroom along with high-tech toys that are distracting kids 24/7. kids need at least nine hours of sleep. parents need to monitor this and make sure each child is getting enough zzzs.

it sounds as though you are taking very good steps to prevent osteoporosis. exercise has a wide variety of beneficial health effects. however exercise does not bring about substantial increases in bone density. the benefit of exercise for osteoporosis has mostly to do with decreasing the risk of falls probably because balance is improved and/or muscle strength is increased. research has not yet determined what type of exercise is best for osteoporosis or for how long. until research has answered these questions most doctors recommend weight-bearing exercise such as walking preferably daily. you are also right in not smoking. smoking cigarettes decreases estrogen levels and can lead to bone loss in women before menopause. smoking cigarettes can also lead to earlier menopause. in regard to calcium it is recommended that premenopausal women take 1 000 mg of calcium in their diet each day. unfortunately surveys have shown that average women in the united states are consuming less than 500 mg of calcium per day in their diet less than the recommended amounts. additional calcium can be obtained by drinking more milk and consuming more yogurt cottage cheese and calcium-fortified foods such as orange juice or by taking calcium supplement tablets. before taking calcium supplements check with your doctor. calcium supplements are generally avoided if one has had kidney stones. an adequate calcium intake and adequate body stores of vitamin d are important foundations for maintaining bone density and strength. vitamin d helps the absorption of calcium from the intestines. vitamin d comes from the diet and the skin. vitamin d production by the skin is dependent on exposure to sunlight. active people living in sunny regions (southern california hawaii countries around the equator etc. ) can produce most of the vitamin d they need from their skin. conversely lack of exposure to sunlight due to residence in northern latitudes or physical incapacitation causes vitamin d deficiency. in less temperate regions such as minnesota michigan and new york skin production of vitamin d is markedly diminished in the winter months especially among the elderly. in that population dietary vitamin d becomes important. when a women becomes menopausal estrogen supplementation is considered. menopausal hormone therapy (previously referred to as hormone replacement therapy or hrt) has been shown to prevent bone loss increase bone density and prevent bone fractures. it is useful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Patient Question:
how is spondylolisthesis and stenosis affected by exercise and what restrictions are necessary?

Actual Doctor's Response:
spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over an adjacent vertebra. it typically occurs in the lumbar spine and is the result of an injury to or degeneration of one or both of the facet joints of the bone. facet joints help support the weight of the spine and control movement (extension flexion and twisting). symptoms of spondylolisthesis although not present in everyone (it depends on the degree of slippage) can include pain in the low back thighs or legs. pain is due to inflammation of the facet joint or compression impingement or shear forces on a disc. the condition is also associated with muscle spasms weakness and tightness (low back and hamstrings). exercises that emphasize proper body mechanics and stabilize the spine during movements like flexion and extension and stretches for the low back and hamstrings should be prescribed. pelvic tilts abdominal crunches with legs on a chair leg raises (with knees bent and abdominal muscles contracted the bent knee is lifted) and gluteal piriformis and hamstring stretches can all be helpful. proper ergonomics while seated at a desk proper posture while standing and safe lifting technique should all be taught. exercises to avoid are forward bending without the knees bent and abdominals tight bending forward while twisting and any other movement that causes pain. exercises should be individualized depending on the symptoms type and grade of spondylolisthesis. no exercises should be performed if the individual has symptoms and exercises that cause pain should be stopped immediately. you should speak with your client's doctor before you prescribe any exercises and i recommend that you become familiar with the anatomy and biomechanics of the injury as well as the effects of different exercises on the spine.

exercise helps keep you fit. it strengthens muscles keeps joints flexible and boosts mood by increasing serotonin in your body. serotonin is a neurotransmitter that scientists have found to be related to fibromyalgia. neurotransmitters are chemicals that send specific messages from one cell to another. while only a small percentage of serotonin is located in the brain this neurotransmitter is believed to play a vital role in mediating moods. too much stress can lead to permanently low levels of serotonin. that in turn can lead to aggression and feelings of depression. lack of exercise can aggravate low serotonin levels. on the other hand increased levels of serotonin in the brain are associated with a calming anxiety reducing effect. in some cases they are also associated with drowsiness. having a stable level of serotonin in the brain is linked with a positive mood.

most helpful answer keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you. steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you. this is not something you can do at home or with any over-the-counter medications. surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed.

i was diagnosed with chlamydia and am now being tested for all other stis such as hiv. is this routine? . i was called last night by my doctor telling me that i tested + for chlamydia. i was given 1g of zithromax & took it last night. i called this morning to ask when to retest & they told me that i would need to retest for other stds such as hiv what are the chances that i have contracted another more serious sti such as hiv? . i looked up symptoms for hiv & i am not showing any symptoms. in all honesty i am relatively healthy & haven't been showing symptoms for anything - including chlamydia.

Actual Doctor's Response:
other stds can have few if any symptoms early in the disease process. when you get one std from unprotected sex you are more likely to get others. perhaps from the same person/sexual encounter. chlamydia often travels with other "friends". and these friends you do not need. so it is wise to be tested for other common stds. just in case.

the short answer to your question is: no. none of the ingredients in advil (generic name: ibuprofen) or advilpm (which is simply a combination of ibuprofen and the antihistamine diphenhydramine) would cause a false-positive result for benzodiazepines on a urine drug screen. the chemical structure of benzodiazepines doesn't remotely resemble those of any of the ingredients in the over-the-counter medications you were taking. the only substances known to cause a false-positive test for benzodiazepines are oxaprozin (which is a prescription arthritis medication) and sertraline (which is an antidepressant medication with the brand name zoloft). is it possible you take sertraline? if so that could be the culprit in your urine screen. i'm sorry this happened to you and hope you can get it resolved. wishing you well! i tested pisitive for benzo and i to was also taking advil pms

Patient Question:
why are men's bathrooms so dirty?

Actual Doctor's Response:
according to a recent study 85 percent of americans are washing their hands after using a public bathroom; improved from 77 percent a few years ago. the other 15 percent are contaminating the rest of our world. nearly three times as many women wash their hands than men however. apparently men have a prevailing assumption that if you don’t pee on your fingers you don’t need to wash your hands. personally i am not overly worried about the pee-guys but i do worry about the men behind those stall doors. men’s restrooms are considerably nastier than the women’s facilities (so i am told). if i am forced to use a public restroom i try not to touch anything if i can help it. i consider bathrooms stalls the most contaminated rooms on this planet. i would love to put on some type of biological hazard suit but this isn’t practical. i have seen impatient dancing women quickly use a men’s room when the line to the women’s restroom is too long. it only takes one of these experiences to truly appreciate the difference. for the first time i would like to reveal the inner workings of a typical men’s room. there is usually a bank of urinals against one wall about five. men do not like to stand side by side with another man peeing so whenever possible an unused urinal becomes the “buffer. ” some urinals have little walls between them but most are open. there may or may not be a lower urinal for little boys. in the stalls i would be shocked not to find urine on the seat. even though urine is usually sterile no one wants to ever sit on it. men like urinals (sort of) but little boys do not. they are either too short to use them or too shy. given a choice little boys head for the stall where they will freely pee on the seat the floor and the flush handle before finding their mark. i would be shocked not to find sticky urine on the floor near the toilet. men do not like to sit on strange toilets. given the choice they prefer the one at home well-stocked with reading material. unlike women men have not developed the fine art of toilet seat hovering. men are accustomed to sitting down and reading for a while. women typically pee and leave. no one really knows the best toilet stall to use. i guess the best one would be the handicap stall but that isn’t very nice to occupy. most will use the stall most distant from the door however you do tend to select the one that looks the cleanest and has a flushed toilet. if you must use a stall you really don’t want to pick a stall next to an actively occupied one. it can be disconcerting to hear all of those bathroom noises next door or see someone’s shoes tapping out a silent tune. i do witness men washing their hands but a two-second splash of water and maybe a little soap is not thorough hand-washing. (to learn how to do it right watch the webmd video how and when to wash your hands. ) if there are paper towels available men will use them. if there is an electric hand-dryer most will not stand there long enough to get their hands dry. they will them dry on their pants and just leave. restroom doors tend to open inward which means that your clean hands will need to touch a door handle freshly contaminated by the non-handwashers. i usually just hang around long enough for someone to come in and then i will shoot out before the door closes. growing up in appalachia we had outdoor toilets at my junior high. there was no running water to wash your hands. because of this frightening experience i learned to hold it all day if need be rather than use this outhouse. this ability has served me well over the years. unless i am truly desperate i do not use a public restroom. i used to work for an office cleaning company and the women's restrooms were worse. they would not sit on the seats. their pee would spray all over.

" the baby is moving often too -- twisting turning wiggling punching and kicking. mom-to-be : congratulations! you're at about the midpoint of your pregnancy. your uterus is just about even with your navel. your waistline has pretty much disappeared but only temporarily! the risk of bladder infections increases because the smooth muscles in the urinary tract relax. your breathing will become deeper and you may perspire more than usual from a more active thyroid gland. tip of the week : to alleviate backaches maintain good posture. sit with a footstool or use an ergonomic chair at the office avoid standing for too long sleep with a small pillow under your side at the waist and lift things with your legs instead of your back.

Actual Doctor's Response:
it is normal to have some morning accumulation of fluid or mucous-like substance in the corners of the eye. thinner drainage like tears will drain down the nasolacrimal duct into your nose and not be noticed. the thicker material just can make it through this tiny drainage tube. the eye is always secreting tears and lubrication (from oil-like glands under the eyelid) so this is not really alarming. true pink eye (conjunctivitis) is typically painful and the drainage is copious all day long. allergic conjunctivitis tends to itch and last a long long time. making a self-diagnosis can be difficult so if you are concerned then you can address this problem with your medical provider or even optometrist.

actually the answer is a bit complicated. high cholesterol and diabetes are independent risk factors for heart disease. some people may have one or the other. but many people have both and they do appear to be related. scientists are studying the effects that high blood sugars and insulin resistance have on the different types of fats in the blood. insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. it helps the cells in the body take up and use glucose for energy. in diabetes the cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. glucose then builds up in the blood. the more resistant the cells are to insulin the higher the triglycerides and ldl (or bad cholesterol) levels become. at the same time the hdl (or good cholesterol) levels fall. but the good news is that both diabetes and high cholesterol can respond to the same healthy lifestyle changes. talk to your doctor about positive changes that you can make in your diet and exercise habits that can put you back on the road to good health. webmd is a great source of information about diabetes and about high cholesterol. here are two links to get you started. <link> <link> you may also want to talk to a diabetes educator or nutritionist. they can help create a diet plan that is right for you.

got dtap vaccine week ago. injection area is swollen and has knot gets sorer every day. is this normal?

Actual Doctor's Response:
soreness at the injection site is probably the most common adverse effect especially with the dtap. often this is not just due to vaccine but the trauma of the needle and some bleeding into the tissue (usually this is the cause of the "knot"). warm compresses may help as well as some ibuprofen for the inflammation. if it becomes red and more swollen you will need to see your medical provider to see if you have a injection site infection.

the most common thing to feel would be the end of your cervix. it is at the back of the vaginal canal and feels firm like the end of one's nose. often there are nabothian cysts on the face of the cervix which can make it feel irregular or bumpy. (nabothian cysts are clogged mucus secreting ducts--kind of like getting a clogged pore on your face. ) less commonly you might be feeling a vaginal inclusion cyst. yet these tend to be softer than the cervix. your best bet is to see your gyn and have them do both a palpation with fingers and a speculum exam to try and see if there is any type of cyst present.

Actual Doctor's Response:
your question touches upon a very important issue and one that many americans struggle with. millions of people either hang onto a job because they can't afford to lose the health insurance or go uninsured which is particularly dangerous for folks like yourself with a chronic condition. job gaps after january 1 2014 will no longer be a concern with regard to health insurance. you'll be able to buy a policy through your state's marketplace and be guaranteed coverage even with a pre-existing health condition. when you lose access to affordable coverage provided by your employer you'll be eligible to buy a plan on your own. likely you'll also qualify for financial assistance to lower your costs.

Actual Doctor's Response:
any patient-specific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it. the vicodin will not be bio-effective after six hours or so so anytime after that.

as you know i cannot "see" your throat and examine you over the internet and unfortunately your description is really not specific enough for me to even guess. a medical provider must see these things first-hand. a mono test taken early in the course of an illness may not be very accurate so your medical provider should consider doing an ebv titer (a very sensitive mono test) if the clinical findings warrant it. a z-pack is not the treatment of choic for strep so perhaps a repeat strep culture is indicated as well (not the rapid strep test) and while you are at it a cbc (complete blood count) would be helpful information. the vast majority of sore throats are viral but sometimes this virus is mono so this diagnosis needs to be revisited.

Patient Question:
my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it?

Actual Doctor's Response:
my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
shingles can occur in many areas of the body. if the outbreak is on his chest back abdomen etc. where it can be easily covered by clothing the risk of transfer will not be very high. if it is on his face then more caution against direct skin-to-skin contact should be exercised. assuming that he is currently under treatment usually with an oral anti-viral medication this will also reduce the chance of spreading it to others. your two year old is vulnerable assuming they had a varicella (chicken pox) vaccination at age one. if not exposure to shingles can actually give an unimmunized person chicken pox. for you assuming you had chicken pox as a child (or the vaccine) you are also vulnerable from direct skin-to-skin contact. do the best that you can without treating your husband like a leper. not everyone who is exposed will even get it but a few simple precautions like covering the area with clothing will help.

Actual Doctor's Response:
contact allergy could do it. dryer softener sheets with perfume is high on my list followed by enzymatic detergents and bath soaps. it could even be that feminine spray even if you have used it in the past. products often change ingredients without changing the brand name. a yeast infection is quite common in this area so if the itch is limited to the clitoral area use a topical antifungal perhaps mixed half/half with 1% hydrocortisone cream.

hi found you this in dr ed. com. the easiest way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to take your blood pressure reading. measuring your blood pressure is very simple and painless. it is carried out with a device called sphygmomanometer (the inflatable cuff that your doctor puts around your arm). within seconds your doctor can measure your blood pressure. the results work like this: anything between 120/80 (120 over 80) and 140/90 (140 over 90) is dubbed the pre-hypertension stage – which often leads to hypertension. between 140/90 and 160/100 you are in stage 1 hypertension. between 160/100 and 180/110 you are in stage 2 hypertension. above 180/110 you are in stage 3 hypertension (and you need immediate medical care) people in stage 3 hypertension tend to suffer from secondary hypertension which is a form of high blood pressure with known causes such as kidney disease hormonal disease (e. g. gland tumour hyperthyroidism) lead poisoning head injuries and pregnancy. so your 200/150 puts you in stage 4 not good in fact big trouble and you are in need of help asap so you can chuck away his the salt shaker. stop drinking all alcohol. chuck away any cigarettes you stop smoking now. get out do some walking as much as you can and that will get better as you need exercise. start to eat healthy no more fast or junk foods they are out for good along with the big breakfasts. cut all caffeine so good by joe its out for good. carrying to much weight/obese so that needs to come down not getting enough sleep so he needs far more sleep. could be to much stress so needs some meditation to de-stress him. see he's on lipitor so his doctor must think he has high cholesterol or its from a blood test so if that he has lots of plaque plaques a big thing in hbp he can get this down with this mix below it all very natural and does work. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric with black pepper and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. for each heaped teaspoon of turmeric you add a ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper this helps the turmeric to get absorbed into your system better. the whole mix its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric and bp 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat ( this the heat that cp gives off) that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonful’s each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this mix which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and it clears blocked arteries and veins good at lowering hbp prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric with bp your be doing your body the world of good. turmeric is a great way of fighting and lowering your triglyceride numbers when you have high cholesterol and turmeric is also a way of fighting certain cancers. sauce for info is <link> at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps him. good luck

Actual Doctor's Response:
she probably doesn't need an x-ray but she does need a skilled clinician to perform a careful exam. straddle injuries (and i have seen hundreds of them) can cause some significant injuries but most are either repairable (some cause hiddle tears or lacerations requiring sutures) or heal on their own. a gentle and kind medical professional needs to look at those girl parts and see what injuries have occurred. what you can see could only be part of the damage. this exam can be done painless but prepare her for the unavoidable embarrassment of someone looking at her private parts. if she prefers to see a female provider see if this can be arranged. in the meantime put some cool compresses on those painful parts and get her some medical care. don't worry. serious "internal injuries" would not be very likely.

why cant they see my dad's heart on an mri. my dad had an mri and they said they cant see his heart. what does that mean.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the mri is usually not a whole-body scan but directed to certain areas. i don't know the reason your father was getting an mri but this could be the logical reason. while some fathers my be considered heartless i suspect your father is not one of them. we know he has a heart and a daughter that cares about him.

i'm sorry to hear you're in pain. the good news is once the gallbladder's been removed it can never cause you a problem again. the gallbladder cannot grow back. the pain you are experiencing might feel a lot like the old gallbladder pain but it's definitely something else. the thing is the body isn't all that great about pinpointing the source of pain. this means your pain could be coming from anywhere in the same region as your gallbladder used to be. i suggest you see a doctor for further evaluation. he or she might want to check your liver your pancreas or even your intestines. any of these structures (and many others) could cause pain similar to that of gallstones. the only way you'll know for sure is with a physical examination. wishing you well!

that's a very interesting question. i'm glad you asked. in the medical community we often tend not to treat a condition that's asymptomatic (doesn't have symptoms). as long as you're sure your low testosterone levels aren't related to another condition such as obesity or diabetes i think the choice of whether or not to treat it is up to you. it's a discussion you should have with your health care provider. he or she can contribute their expert medical knowledge and you can take into account your personal values and feelings. between the two of you you can arrive at a decision that's right for you. remember too you can always change your mind. if you choose not to treat your low testosterone now but experience symptoms in the future you can always opt for testosterone replacement therapy. likewise if you decide to treat your low testosterone now you can always choose to discontinue treatment later. take care!

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi this is from the uk’s nhs if you do get signs and symptoms these usually appear between one and three weeks after having unprotected sex with an infected person. for some people the symptoms occur many months later or not until the infection has spread. around half of all men with chlamydia don't notice any symptoms. if men do get symptoms the most common include: pain when urinating (peeing) discharge from the tip of the penis (this can be a white cloudy or watery discharge) pain in the testicles some men have mild symptoms that disappear after two or three days. even if the symptoms disappear you will still have the infection and be able to pass it on. if chlamydia is left untreated in men they are at risk of complications of chlamydeous such as orchitis (swollen testicles) reactive arthritis and infertility. do hope this helps you. good luck

hi and from newkidscentre. com from week 7 to 14. during this time the placenta will also start to produce progesterone and will start to replace the ovaries as the main source of progesterone. this will cause the progesterone levels in the body to plateau though they will start to rise again at the end of the first trimester. it is common to see progesterone levels around 15-60ng/ml but those experiencing a multiple pregnancy will have higher levels. the body will use this hormone to relax the muscles so your body can manage your growing baby more easily. this will also help to prevent contractions too early in your pregnancy. very high levels of progesterone might cause hemorrhoids indigestion heartburn or constipation. furthermore progesterone in different trimesters can vary from at a range of as follows: first t rimester : 9-47ng/ml second trimester : 17-147 ng/ml third t rimester : 55-200 ng/ml so your about 2 points off i don't think its that much to worry over but a test next week may show a new higher reading just where you want it tom be. hope this helps you. good luck

for many years standard radiation therapy involved large machines focusing huge beams of radiation at the prostate or whatever the target organ was. and where those beams all overlapped is where the damage was done. the problem with that was the surrounding tissues were damaged and sometimes tissues and organs in the vicinity couldn’t tolerate the radiation so the dose to the cancer wasn’t high enough. over the past several years they developed a technique called imrt which stands for intensity modulation radiation therapy instead of large beams that focus on the tumor there are computer-generated pencil-sized beams that almost paint the organ so you can get much higher doses with thousands of little microbeams with killing doses on the cancer. but the tissues surrounding the cancer get minimal doses so there’s fewer side effects much higher success at killing the cancer.

the symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. they are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to aging. patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. the symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. common symptoms are listed below: fatigue. depression. modest weight gain. cold intolerance. excessive sleepiness. dry coarse hair. constipation. dry skin. muscle cramps. increased cholesterol levels. decreased concentration. vague aches and pains. swelling of the legs. as the disease becomes more severe there may be puffiness around the eyes a slowing of the heart rate a drop in body temperature and heart failure. in its most profound form severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). in a severely hypothyroid individual a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness surgery stress or traumatic injury. this condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection. properly diagnosed hypothyroidism can be easily and completely treated with thyroid hormone replacement. on the other hand untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) worsening heart failure and an accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion).

is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
that’s a controversy. i have many patients including physicians as adults who’ve been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they’re hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it’s almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off. some men will tell you that they don’t feel any more or less after the circumcision. some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that don’t like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it’s social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place. there are risks to the surgery. in good hands those risks are minimal but they can’t be eliminated. so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides. usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact. luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling. you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well. great product. hope this helps.

" according to the north american menopause society early menopause is when the last natural menstrual period occurs before age 45 while premature menopause indicates a woman aged 40 or less. premature ovarian failure (pof) like premature menopause also is linked to being age 40 or younger. among researchers who study pof a term used first by the french -- ovarian insufficiency -- may become the new standard term for pof.

Actual Doctor's Response:
overall weight will depend on his position on the field. if he has hoped to be on the o-line then he may be small. if he is a quarterback he may be perfect. overall he needs an adequate balance of protein carbs and fat in his diet. carb-loading i typically reserve more for the endurance athletes but keeping properly fueled up is very important. i think in the end good common sense is key. he is a big kid and obviously very active. he needs to eat a lot to keep up and this should be a well-balanced diet. he should also be very aware of keeping well-hydrated but not just water-loading the day of a game. i am sure there are college demographics for typical size for each position on the field but at 15 the most important factor is enough of all of the vitamins minerals and protein that his body requires to stay healthy and fit

Actual Doctor's Response:
the duration progression and distribution of the symptoms makes me think of zoster as a possibility. the painful rash of zoster usually starts after localized symptoms of pain tingling or itching. typically this is seen on one side of the body. a painful rash follows and it resolves within a 2-4 week period if no complications occur. its probably best to see your healthcare provider to get checked and appropriately diagnosed. treatments for zoster can shorten the duration and severity of the illness but treatments needs to be started as soon as the rash appears. nerve damage or neorapthy but sounds like nerve damage for sure have u been n any accidents or anything at home or work it sound like kidney damage.

there are two forms of hepatitis c. the first form is called acute hepatitis c which means that you recently became infected with the virus. the second form is called chronic hepatitis c which means that you have had an infection for more than 6 months. most people who are infected with hepatitis c develop chronic hepatitis c. but even people who have been infected for a while usually do not have symptoms. this makes it common for people to have hepatitis c for 15 years or longer before it is diagnosed. many people find out by accident that they have the virus such as when donating blood or having a routine physical exam. if symptoms do develop they may include: fatigue. joint pain. belly pain. itchy skin. sore muscles. dark urine. jaundice a condition in which the skin and the whites of the eyes look yellow. hepatitis c damages your liver very slowly. about 25% of people who have long-term (chronic) hepatitis c will go on to develop severe liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis) after a period of about 20 years or more. 1 if you develop cirrhosis you may have: redness on the palms of your hands caused by expanded small blood vessels. clusters of blood vessels just below the skin that look like tiny red spiders and usually appear on your chest shoulders and face. swelling of your belly legs and feet. muscle shrinking. bleeding from enlarged veins in your digestive tract which is called variceal bleeding. variceal bleeding can be very serious even though you may not have previous symptoms of the problem. damage to your brain and nervous system which is called encephalopathy. encephalopathy can cause symptoms such as confusion and memory and concentration problems. many other health problems are associated with long-term cirrhosis. for more information see the topic cirrhosis. there also are many other conditions with similar symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

yes allegra is the same as fexofenadine. every medication has two names a brand and a generic name. the original creators are the only ones who can use the brand name. once the recipe becomes available to other drug manufacturers they sell the product under the generic name. it usually takes approximately seven years for the brand to go generic. the main active ingredient has to remain the same in each recipe. what differs from the brand and generic are the inactive ingredients that can hold the medication together and that give it its color. in addition the generic can be much more affordable. most generics are fda approved to be equally effective. therefore if the generic works for you then there is no need to switch. also make sure to only take one and not both the brand and generic to prevent overdosing and additive side effects.

Patient Question:
i have pcos. why do i gain weight if i'm active and eat well? can i get back to the way i was last year (100 lbs less)? . i used to be a model. very healthly and very active. i went on the birth control pill for a couple of weeks but they made me very sick so i went off of them. that is when this all started. i have always been very active and very healthy. now i'm losing all of my hair; very seldom do i menstrate; i have excessive body hair growth; i gained about 100 pounds; and i have many more symptoms. i have been tossed back and fourth between doctors and noone helps me: they just brush me off on to others.

Actual Doctor's Response:
pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so it’s important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? what’s a reasonable calorie restriction for you? what’s your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps. <link> i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are "out of whack. " birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle (though not all of the time). i would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologist(sp? ).

here's a longer preview of my question with details: hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 and some days would exercise with my partner for nearly 2 hours almost 2 times a month. i've been working on eating correctly as well (oats fruit no processed foods/sugars). i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 or more glasses of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting heart rate ranges from 74-80 bpm. my problem is during 2 weeks i've been experiencing high pulse rates from (94-104) and on some days a single heart flutter. sometimes during sleeping i wake with strange high pulses. a few days ago i've awaken from a deep dreaming sleep having two heart flutters and freaked out. near the end of the day i get these weird stingy/squeezy chest pains that occur near my left breast very close to the armpit. sometimes i get the same pain at the same spot in my right chest but it's much lighter than the left. my leg elbows of my arms and stomach would also have very mild/light pains that pulsate but disappear after a while. this happens when i'm resting but not when i exercise. they last from 2-20 seconds and disappear or reoccur slightly when in bed. the day before this past halloween i visited a doctor at a clinic and she basically laughed at me saying i was too paranoid and having anxiety. she checked my heart beat and breathing through a stethoscope but no more after that. she said i was too young to be having heart problems. i'm afraid of going back due to spending way too much money just to hear the same reply. this is starting to scare me and i'm very hesitant to return to my regular exercise and weight training since this has been happening. i don't think i have diabetes since i don't get the symptoms (and i'm like a hawk keeping an eye on any similar rising symptoms if i get them). should i continue with my daily activities? how about suggested foods to eat in a single day for healthy heart function? again i don't eat a lot of sugars. thank you.

if your urine is dark amber in color and has a strong odor too it may indicate that it's extremely concentrated. this can happen after heavy exercise and sweating and means that you need to drink more water to avoid dehydration. if the extra water intake doesn't lighten the color and odor of your urine you may have other conditions that require medical attention such as a urinary tract infection or even early diabetes. sometimes foods cause urine to have an odor (asparagus for example) but the odor should go away after a few hours or overnight. if a strong odor persists it's time to contact your health care provider and have a urine test to determine the cause.

the short answer to your question is: no. lymphedema means swelling ("edema") due to excessive lymph fluid ("lymph"). normally fluid circulates through the lymph glands and lymph system which trap and destroy bacteria viruses and other potentially harmful substances. after a mastectomy for example the lymph nodes of the upper arm often are removed which means the fluid that used to circulate through the lymph system instead pools in the tissue of the arms and causes swelling. this is one form of lymphedema. a connective tissue disease on the other hand is a disorder that affects the tissues that connect and support joints and organs. examples of these types of tissues are cartilage bone and fat. there are hundreds of types of connective tissue disorders some of which are inherited (genetic) and others that are autoimmune disorders. i hope this information helps!

Actual Doctor's Response:
decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separately. as long as the dosgages are appropriate. newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the child's medical provider. decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds; and do not help children with allergies. antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the "okay" from your child's pediatrician because of the age.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if you are allergic to amoxicillin you should avoid all drugs in the penicillin class. this would include oxacillin. it is entirely possible to have taken a penicillin in childhood without any adverse reaction and then develop an allergy later in life. that's because allergies develop upon repeated exposure to an allergen. in other words almost no one is allergic to penicillin the first time they're exposed. most people exhibit an allergic reaction on some subsequent exposure. you should be sure to note your penicillin allergy on your medical record. a severe allergic reaction to penicillin can result in death. for most needs there are other antibiotics that can be used in place of a penicillin. wishing you well!

yes. childhood depression is different from the normal "blues" and everyday emotions that occur as a child develops. just because a child seems depressed or sad does not necessarily mean they have depression. but if these symptoms become persistent disruptive and interfere with social activities interests schoolwork and family life it may indicate that he or she has the medical illness called depression. keep in mind that while depression is a serious illness it is also a treatable one.

asthma. i was to be treated for asthma when i was younger for maybe a year. now i am 21 and have recently been having trouble breathing when walking across campus or up stairs. i am not overweight. i have been smoking cigarettes occasionally though. could this be bringing back the symptoms of asthma?

Actual Doctor's Response:
smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect asthma. if you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this; 1. put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes (i. e. stepping out of a warm car into cold air. ) 2. start deep breathing exercises. my doctor had me start with just ten a day. he said to find a quiet relaxing place where i can time my breaths. breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you can't. do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath. each night try holding it a little longer. you will be amazed how well this will help 3. check with a doctor. your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath. you may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes. 4. ask ten smokers over 40 when they started and why. also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same. both my kids tried smoking in college. after doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive. good luck! and use your head!

Patient Question:
how long should a parent brush or help brush a child's teeth?

it takes many years before children develop the fine motor coordination they need to do a good tooth brushing job. some dentists advise that parents brush their children's teeth until the child can neatly write his or her own name. other dentists suggest parents use their own judgment but to consider between ages 6 and 8 as the time for kids to take on the job of keeping their teeth clean and healthy. general rule: a smear or pea sized drop of fluoridated toothpaste can be used when the child can spit effectively.

Patient Question:
do hernias usually develop on both sides of the body?

Actual Doctor's Response:
groin hernias are somewhat more likely to develop on both sides. this is probably because the structural elements develop symmetrically and the stresses on the body that occur over time are similar on both sides. when a patient becomes aware of a groin swelling on one side examination by a doctor will often identify a small hernia on the opposite side.

hiatal hernias are categorized as being either sliding or para-esophageal. sliding hiatal hernias sliding hiatal hernias the most common type of hernia are those in which the junction of the esophagus and stomach referred to as the gastro-esophageal junction and part of the stomach protrude into the chest. the junction may reside permanently in the chest but often it juts into the chest only during a swallow. this occurs because with each swallow the muscle of the esophagus contracts causing the esophagus to shorten and to pull up the stomach. when the swallow is finished the herniated part of the stomach falls back into the abdomen. para-esophageal hernias are hernias in which the gastro-esophageal junction stays where it belongs attached at the level of the diaphragm but part of the stomach passes or bulges into the chest beside the esophagus. the para- esophageal hernias themselves remain in the chest at all times and are not affected by swallows. para-esophageal hiatal hernias a para-esophageal hiatal hernia that is large particularly if it compresses the adjacent esophagus may impede the passage of food into the stomach and cause food to stick in the esophagus after it is swallowed. ulcers also may form in the herniated stomach due to the trauma caused by food that is stuck or acid from the stomach. fortunately large para-esophageal hernias are uncommon.

Actual Doctor's Response:
in some cases waking up hungry would not be a problem but it sounds like it is affecting your quality of life. in addition to your protein source at dinner try including a big salad and/or soup whole grains and some healthy fat (olive oil avocado etc. ). eating from all the food groups helps increase feelings of fullness. you can also try a bedtime snack of something light like fruit with peanut butter or whole grain crackers and cheese. if you are staying up late this can increase hunger so getting to sleep early can help. you also want to make sure you get enough to eat earlier in the day including a good breakfast and lunch with in between healthy snacks. also make sure you are hydrated so that isn't being confused with hunger. for more tips on managing your hunger see this article. good luck!

i believe in keeping a close relationship with a general practitioner or family doctor. this person will monitor your health by keeping accurate records of your medical history. this individual will get to know you and note changes in your health through comparing diagnostic test results. my insurance carrier pays for and encourage a wellness visit to my primary care physician once per year. these insurance carriers have what i call "bean counters" who have determined that this yearly visit catches problematic conditions and saves them money. you may coordinate that yearly general practitioner visit with the flu season and obtain flu and possible pneumonia inoculations. having that family doctor relationship will probably make it easier to be see if you do become ill. during illness this individual can do preliminary diagnostic testing conduct a physical exam begin treatment efforts and refer you to other medical specialists as needed. the bottom line is if you are in good health a once per year visit to the family doctor along with your regular gynecologist appointment and mammograms will keep you feeling well. those actions will also reveal any medical problems early when they best respond to treatment.

Actual Doctor's Response:
after an operation cardiologist and my doctor decided to put me under statines and cardioaspirine and i followed their prescriptions for one year since i noticed that i have muscular problems and strange troubles when i streched them. one time i had to stay in bed for 3 days without force like if it was a serious atack of flue. after i read that this was a side effect of statines i decided to stop and to change my life. one year after and 10kg less i just pass an exam and the cardiologist says to me that everything is perfect cholesterol is under the limit cardiogram and an effort test have been without any problem. the doctor says to me to continue absolutely with statines and cardioaspirine as i didn't say to him that i stop to take them since one year for me is a good sign. the results are obtained like this: with exercice and with a strict dieta. every morning from 7 to 9 i do exercices in a fitness center. one part with a group one part alone with all the machines. in one year i frequently arrive to make exercices that many young people can't and i'm like an exemple for that center as i am 70 years old. i only take a rest one time a week. about dieta i avoid all industrial food like cakes or pastries but also bread rice potatoes pastas and pizzas (especially in the evening) i only eat meat one time a week (frequently chicken with a glass of wine) the other days only fish and 4 o 5 different vegetables cooked in the oven. two to 4 meals a week with nuts and seeds of any kind. (15 different sorts in a very small quantity as together it can be 150 grams). i was never feeling so well and i'm still actifve in my company. frankly statines are the contrary of what we need as they provoke muscular problems and other different sicknesses and this can impeach you to make the exercice that you need. it's really a non-sense medication! you are becoming impotent and more sick instead of beeing better. when i heard that actually there is a campaign among doctors and medias to prescribe statines even for chieldren it's really like a crime. the level of cholesterol has been invented by doctors payed by the producers of statines and not by indipendent doctors. remember.

Patient Question:
i'm 34 have hot flashes night sweats high fsh levels and no period for two months. do i have ovarian failure? . after a progesterone withdrawal test my period started in two days.

Actual Doctor's Response:
what the progesterone withdrawal tells you is that there is definitely some stimulation of the lining of the uterus by estrogen -- estrogen can come from the ovary and it also can be made in other parts of the body too. if the fsh is high it does mean that most likely you are heading toward menopause. the major question i would ask you is "are you hoping to have children beyond this point? " if you are i would encourage you to consult with a gynecologist who specializes in what is called reproductive endocrinology as soon as you can. (the american society of reproductive medicine or asrm could help you find someone near you if you don't know of anyone locally). if you are not planning for children at this point there is no race toward intervention. if you are indeed heading toward menopause and are having symptoms you would be a good candidate for a low-dose birth control pill that would take care of your symptoms well. as i have mentioned before for women who do experience premature ovarian failure taking hormones is usually a good idea -- so do not be afraid of hormonal intervention.

it is possible to have light bleeding or spotting during pregnancy. my sister in law did with her oldest. but it wouldn't be a normal period. during a period the lining of the uterus sheds since a fertilized egg did not "stick". so if a full blown period starts. my guess would be that your not pregnant since your period flushes everything out.

we hear in the news and in commercials that plant sterols are good for us and lower cholesterol levels. we are even fortifying certain foods and some baby aspirin with these phytosterols. yet these phytosterols may be more atherogenic (have the ability to initiate or accelerate atherogenesis — formation of fat deposits on the inner lining of blood vessels) than cholesterol in certain groups of people. stanols on the other hand are good for everyone and do lower cholesterol levels. let’s start with some definitions: * cholesterol is a sterol. a sterol is a steroid with an alcohol group attached to it. * stanols are saturated or reduced sterols that are similar to cholesterol but have a methyl or an ethyl group attached to them. this difference minimizes stanol absorption in the intestines. * cholestanol is a stanol. cholesterol can be broken down by the liver into cholestanol and thus is a by-product of cholesterol metabolism. if sterols or stanols are esterified (combined with fatty acids) then they can be incorporated into margarine. we consume many sterols from plant sources (sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol) shellfish (desmosterol and fucosterol) and animal sources (cholesterol). all of these sterols with the exception of cholesterol are collectively referred to as noncholesterol sterols. collectively these sterols can be called phytosterols. sitosterol represents about 80% of all noncholesterol sterols in the diet and is the most well known noncholesterol sterol in the diet. when fats (triglycerides) enter the intestine in our food they are broken down into their basic building blocks. the main breakdown products are called fatty acids. these fatty acids and sterols from dietary sources are packaged into what is called a micelle. these micelles “ferry” these fatty acids and sterols to the intestinal lining (epithelium). they are then absorbed by passive diffusion into the intestinal cells. passive diffusion is a biological principle that substances flow through a semi-permeable tissue from an area of higher concentration to an area of lesser concentration. there is no pump required to get them out of the intestine and ultimately into the bloodstream. most humans absorb about 50% of sterols in the intestines. however there are some people who are what is termed” hyperabsorbers” (they absorb 60-80%) and some are “hypoabsorbers” (they absorb less than 50%). noncholesterol sterols are not esterified as humans do not have the enzymes necessary for that. when these unesterified sterols get into an arterial wall they are more atherogenic than cholesterol (an esterified sterol). this means they have a greater artery clogging potential than does cholesterol. if one lacks these transporters (homozygote) all sterols are absorbed and none are pumped back out: this is a very rare homozygous condition leading to the disease called sitosterolemia or phytosterolemia. it is associated with severe atherosclerosis as noncholesterol sterols (which cannot be esterified) are more atherogenic than cholesterol. heterozygotes people who have some transporter function eliminate some but not all of these phytosterols. stanols do not require these transporters to get back into these intestines. this is the reason that they are safe and effective to reduce cholesterol. stanols are commercially available in the supermarket in a product called benecol. in summary noncholesterol sterols serve no physiologic function in man. all sterols are atherogenic if they accumulate in the arterial wall. stanols are saturated sterols. they are not absorbed and can be used therapeutically to reduce cholesterol absorption from the intestine.

hi got this piece of info from the uk’s nhs. it’s the uk’s health service so all info is pretty good and correct. increased risks taking ibuprofen particularly at high doses over long periods of time can increase your risk of: stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is disturbed heart attacks – when the blood supply to the heart is blocked in women long-term use of ibuprofen might be associated with reduced fertility. this is usually reversible when you stop taking ibuprofen. if you accidentally take an extra dose of ibuprofen miss out the next dose so you are not taking more than the recommended maximum dose for a 24-hour period. so now do you think its best to stay at what you doing the shot would be far better for you and you would be off the drugs being drug free is far better for you and your health but do stay away from golf tell you get it sorted out. good luck

Patient Question:
what are hormonal causes for heavy periods?

Actual Doctor's Response:
in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand. this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime (eshre 2007). even the use of most hormonal contraceptives (pill/patch/ring) will yield a monthly bleed. so it’s no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual. to address the most-pressing question “when should i be concerned? what is the medical definition of too much bleeding? ” there is a medical definition of “too-heavy periods. ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc (2. 7 ounces — about 1/3 of a cup) or more that is excessive bleeding. trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom! some general indications of excessive bleeding can include: * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60-90 minutes for several hours. * passage of large clots (quarter-sized or larger). * significant bleeding for more than seven days. probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities. so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations. hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation-associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don’t decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened. prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows. there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth (“adenoma”) or a problem with the hypothalamus. all of the stress-related causes of not ovulating (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc. ) can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus. increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time. there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed. so if you or someone you know have episodes of heavy blood loss rather than a normal period talk to your doctor because there are ways to stop going with the flow.

a number of risk factors contribute to the formation of gallstones including genetics and gender (women are twice as likely as men to develop them). body weight is also a factor; the risk of gallstones is higher in people who are overweight and obese. diets that are high in fat and cholesterol and low in fiber appear to play a role. if you're overweight try to lose the extra weight; but do it gradually. there is a link between quick weight loss and gallstone formation. crash or "yo-yo" diets can cause the liver to release more cholesterol into the bile disrupting the normal balance of cholesterol and bile salts. that extra cholesterol can form into crystals leading to gallstones.

Patient Question:
how do you break a fever in a toddler?

Actual Doctor's Response:
it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature 98. 6f. it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at 98. 6f. what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of 101 f. but the body is still 98. 6 f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever "breaks"? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to 98. 6f. now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98. 6f. it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever "breaking". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff.

i am 54 (female) and have not excercised in years. is it too late to start and also see results? . is there such a thing as toning flabby areas at my age?

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking. according to the experts it is never too late to start an exercise program. they have worked with people in nursing homes who were unable to walk and got them walking again! get cleared by your doctor first to make sure you do not have any underlying health problems. start gradually. just walking at first and then you can join a gym and work with a trainer for a while. you will be surprise with the results. it is never too late to start exercising. it is important that you get a professional trainer to guide you in exercising. you can start with something like yoga which will not be too stressful along with brisk walking. once your body adjusts to this routine you can hit the gym for light weights too.

a few problems with your story. 1. fever is harmless; both the 103 and the 100. it is unlikely that an experienced physician would do anything. fever is more beneficial and does not need to be treated at all. 2. mono is a virus and it is not treatable either

Patient Question:
how will i know if my boss gets rid of company insurance because of the affordable care act?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the only real way to know is to ask. however if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law i would be wary of the answer. in fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so. they'll also pay a penalty if at least one full-time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces. today 98% of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94% of businesses with 50 to 199 employees. and they’ve providing insurance long before the aca became law for a host of good reasons the law doesn't change. for one providing insurance is a tax-free form of compensation. and a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees. we have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50-employee threshold – it could certainly raise an employer's costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and don’t offer insurance. and some industries with part-time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week. but for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs. i would need to know more about your particular employer's situation but on the face of it it doesn't seem eliminating insurance if it's already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law. i have been in the health insurance business for 40 years. the aca (obamacare) mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans. this is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance. one wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own. the exchanges are simply private insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace. they are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price. no one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges. some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others. these private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks. it is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business. that having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system. it simply has not worked and i personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future. in fact in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with canadian citizens. i know i know canadians are marching to the us for their health care needs. this post is to short to actually address this issue but suffice to say canadians are not coming in any great numbers to the us for their basic health care needs. actually when you factor out tourists from canada who receive emergency treatment the incidence of canadians coming to the us is actually quite small and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in canada for those types of services. take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies. many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend. for your research pleasure i would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future. see the book "the healing of america; a global quest for better cheaper and fairer health care" by t. r. reid. finally yes we have the finest health care system in the world but only if you can afford it. the answer this so called " expert " gave is misleading. the truth is that the aca will cost small businesses more or it will cost tax payers way more. anytime the government says they give subsidies they are talking about using the taxes they collect from you and your boss to pay for it. so it is a pay me now or pay me later thing. this law is not suppose to work. it is designed to crush privately owned insurance and collapse the healthcare system in our country. they want a single payer system. the same one that has failed in every country and in every way. so yes it will cost you more. a lot more and for less coverage. anytime an obama spokesperson talks about how obamacare isn't working they end it with" that's why we need a single payer system". so take what this site says with a grain of salt. they are part of healthcare. gov. this administration in the white house has lied from day one. my daughters employer switched retirees to another plan. even her disability annuity is less. she has just undergone colon surgery and the new plan does not offer her required med supplies nursing home for rehab even her disability annuity is less. read where a lot of corporations have done this - tired of everything being blamed on obama. what are people doing especially thru the surgeries infections wound pumps - when something like this happens i will put it this way. my wife has a heart condition and went without seeing a dr for almost 4 years because we could not afford the insurance. now she has seen her dr and dentist and has not paid a penny more than the premium. we are one of the few 1st world countries without a centralized health care system. the reason for that is because the insurance companies are going to loose a lot of money. aca will work and that scares the pants off the insurance companies.

tetanus vaccines are 100% protective against tetanus for ten years. the injection does not protect you against any other wound infection -- just tetanus --- so good first aid after any injury is always necessary. there are much better antiseptics than after shave lotion (alcohol) so perhaps you should improve your home first-aid kit. you can always get wound infections.

Actual Doctor's Response:
ringworm of the scalp or beard is treated with antifungal pills in combination with antifungal shampoo or lotion. topical antifungal medicines such as shampoos or lotions that you apply directly to the infected area do not work when used alone because they cannot get deep enough into the infected hair shaft to kill fungi there. but antifungal shampoo helps prevent spreading the fungus to other people because it decreases fungal shedding from the scalp or beard area. doctors also recommend occasional use of antifungal shampoos for ringworm carriers people who can spread the fungus but do not have ringworm symptoms. often an adult becomes a carrier after exposure to an infected child. what to think about ringworm of the scalp or beard can come back after treatment has cleared the infection. ringworm of the scalp or beard can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

most cases of ringworm of the skin including jock itch and ringworm of the hand can be treated with creams or ointments that you put on your skin to kill fungi. these are called topical antifungals. you can get many topical antifungals without a prescription. brand names include micatin tinactin monistat -derm lotrimin and lamisil. you may need to take antifungal pills (oral treatment) if the ringworm does not go away after you have tried different topical antifungals or if the infection is widespread. oral treatments include azoles such as fluconazole ( diflucan ) allylamines such as terbinafine (lamisil) and griseofulvin ( fulvicin u/f grifulvin v). your rash may start to clear up soon after you begin treatment but it is important to use the medicine exactly as the label or your doctor says. this will help keep the infection from coming back. you will probably need to continue treatment for 2 to 4 weeks. if not treated ringworm can spread and the skin can become irritated and painful. skin blisters and cracks can become infected with bacteria. if this happens you may need to take antibiotics. what to think about you should treat a fungal infection right away. severe and widespread infections can be hard to treat. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

hi 3 days before your period is not the time to get pregnant now having sex around day 12 now then you would have to worry so think back did you have unprotected sex then by the way day 12 would be 12 days from the beginning of your last period. ok but your on the bc pill yes? did you know that the bc pill is only 99% protective so do you think your in the 1%? it could be that your just having a skipped period it happens but if you doubt this get to your doctor a have a pregnancy test done nothing like being spot on. do hope this helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
my 12 yr old brother has not had any vaccinations. how would he go about being immunized now? the immunization schedule. here in alberta begins at 2 months. for whatever reason my parents did not immunize my brother. he frequently gets acute bronchitis (for about a week) and always gets bronchitis when he gets sick. the last time i had taken him in for antibiotics the doctor asked if he had all his vaccinations. i told him that i thought he was up to date with his immunization schedule but later found out he had never been immunized. how would being vaccinated affect my brother frequently having bronchitis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
in the u. s. the centers for disease control has a "catch-up" vaccination schedule (<link> but i am not sure if canada has a similar resource. i am a huge supporter of vaccines but realistically being vaccinated may not be protective against bronchitis (which is usually viral). influenza and pneumonia vaccines may help him however.

can genital herpes cause chronic insomnia? . i've been so extremely sleepy for the past few years and while i am somewhat stressed i don't think stress can have this much damage in my life. i'm even super sleepy when i don't have school (i. e. summer breaks). i'm pretty sure i have genital herpes based on other symptoms but could this life-crippling insomnia be caused by genital herpes? ! . could treating my genital herpes help my sleep improve (a lot)? . any input would be greatly appreciated!

Actual Doctor's Response:
actually "insomnia" is not the proper word. my trouble is mostly getting a good quality of sleep rather than falling asleep. i don't have too much trouble falling asleep but i don't drift away too easily either. looking back my super-bad quality of sleep started after i received oral sex from someone who had oral herpes! i feel so stupid because it didn't cross my mind that not having symptoms doesn't mean that i can't contract the virus!

who is at risk for psoriatic arthritis?

Actual Doctor's Response:
affecting men and women equally about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis may develop at any age but usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50. while the cause is not known genetic factors along with the immune system likely play a role in determining who will develop the disorder. as many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. having a parent with psoriasis triples the chance of getting psoriasis yourself and thus increases the chance of developing psoriatic arthritis.

you don't say if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and it makes something of a difference. if you take insulin to control your diabetes you could be experiencing either the "dawn phenomenon" or the somogyi effect. it's important to determine what's causing your elevated (though not outrageously i might add) blood sugars in the morning. while the dawn phenomenon is a natural occurrence the somogyi effect can be a result of eating too little of a bedtime snack. before you change your pre-sleep eating habits you should consult with your doctor to discover if the problem is a result of eating or of poor insulin timing. if you don't take insulin to control your diabetes then i'd recommend you eat a protein-rich snack before bedtime. good choices include natural peanut butter (without added sugar) either by itself or on whole-grain crackers some low-fat (or part-skim) string cheese with a small apple or lean meat (such as turkey breast) either by itself or with a slice of whole-grain bread. if you have any questions about controlling your sugars please consult your primary care provider or a certified diabetes educator. best to you!

Patient Question:
how is coronary artery disease treated?

Actual Doctor's Response:
medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen to compensate for the reduced blood supply. three commonly used classes of drugs are the nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. nitroglycerin (nitro-bid) is an example of a nitrate. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) and atenolol (tenormin). examples of calcium blockers include nicardipine (cardene) and nifedipine (procardia adalat). unstable angina is also treated with aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. aspirin prevents clumping of platelets while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. when patients continue to have angina despite taking maximum medications or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing they usually need coronary arteriography. during coronary arteriography doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for percutaneous coronary intervention or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (ptca) where a small balloon is used to inflate the blockage. angioplasty (ptca) is usually followed by placement of a stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) to increase coronary artery blood flow. angioplasty can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. under x-ray guidance a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. a small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. the balloon is then inflated to push the artery open and a steel mesh stent is generally inserted. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (ptca). cabg surgery is ideal for patients with many narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply and also may partially widen the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. three commonly used classes of drugs are nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. examples of nitrates include isosorbide (isordil) isosorbide mononitrate (imdur) and transdermal nitrate patches. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) atenolol (tenormin) and metoprolol (lopressor). examples of calcium blockers include nifedipine (procardia adalat) verapamil (calan verelan verelan pm isoptin isoptin sr covera-hs) diltiazem (cardizem dilacor tiazac) and amlodipine (norvasc). many patients benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. when significant ischemia still occurs either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing coronary arteriography is usually performed often followed by either pci or cabg. patients with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of a heart attack. in addition to angina medications they are given aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. a form of heparin enoxaparin (lovenox) may be administered under the skin and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in patients with unstable angina. aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. newer potent iv anti-platelet drugs ("super aspirins") are also available to help stabilize such patients. while patients with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications they are often at risk for heart attacks. for this reason many patients with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography and possible pci or cabg. pci can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation stenting or atherectomy. during pci a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or arm. the artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. under x-ray guidance (fluoroscopy) a long thin plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the aorta. a contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that x-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. a small diameter guide wire (0. 014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. a balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. this balloon is then inflated for about one minute compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure to as much as 20 atmospheres. finally the balloon is deflated and removed from the body. intracoronary stents either self-expand or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. when the balloon is inflated the stent is expanded and deployed and the balloon is removed. the stent remains in place in the artery. atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire and then activated depending on the device chosen. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients whose illness has not responded to medications and who are not good candidates for balloon angioplasty. cabg is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments that are not well-suited for pci. cabg is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more pci procedures. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing in multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.

is the medicine zovirax or something like that? do you have pills also? do you think you could have washed in the shower a little too roughly? when i've gotten them (mine are actually herpes but called them boils for years because my husband wouldn't accept it until i made him go with me for a test last year). i do realize we get regular ole boils also. however i've never heard of bleeding. if the sore is currently open i would stop the medicine for a day then start back again and see how it does. alternatively i wish you could see or talk to a nurse or dr. but if you're on here you may not be able to do that. another thing i've found soothing is putting a warm chamomile tea bag on there for 1/2 hour; i got that from hubby- he brings me a bowl of hot water to keep rinsing & "steeping" the tea bag. when you wash just blot with a clean cloth (don't re-use until washed) / water only until healed better. the emergency room taught me that because i became allergic to soap & all ointments when i had any infections etc. it helps alot.

Patient Question:
if someone is allergic to formaldehyde where can i find a list of products that do not have it?

Actual Doctor's Response:
formaldehyde sensitivity (causing a rash) is typically diagnosed by patch testing on the skin. if you are found to have a contact allergy avoidance of that item is recommend. there are several other preservatives that are also formaldehyde releasers. these include quaternium-15 imidazolidinyl urea diazolidinyl urea dmdm hydantoin and bronopol. in many cases i recommend avoiding all of these if patch testing is positive to formaldehyde. your doctor can help you decide if the formaldehyde releasers should also be avoided. also your skin doctor may have access to the contact allergen replacement database (card) which can assist in generating lists of products that do not contain certain products in them (such as formaldehyde).

Actual Doctor's Response:
unless your doctor actually did a test (rapid strep test or culture) to confirm that you have strep the diagnosis could be incorrect. you may have a viral infection or even mono. obviously since i can't examine you i have no way of making that important diagnostic call. most viral infections improve on day four (even if you do nothing) so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again.

i have never heard anything linking cancer to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. it is possible that the stress of living with and being treated for cancer might have triggered or exacerbated any latent mental issues she may have had but for cancer and mental health issues to be linked seems very very unlikely. keep in mind that many people suffer from mental illnesses for years before being diagnosed especially if their symptoms are minor and non-disruptive and stressful events can cause any underlying issues to rapidly deteriorate. it is possible that your friend is unfortunately one of many to slip through the cracks. even in recent years diagnosis and treatment of psychological issues can be very difficult as not everyone responds the same even to the most reliable methods. a physician or psychologist possible both can help your friend find more specialized help if traditional methods don't seem to be working. assuming she is on medication they can explore different types to see if they work better and sometimes psychiatry can help more effectively; it depends on the patient the severity of the illness and what kind of bipolar or schizophrenia your friend has. you yourself can help by being there for her in what i'm sure must be a very difficult and frightening time for you both. sometimes with mental disorders having a loved one by your side can serve as a valuable anchor point for seeking or sticking with treatment. on a side note ect has been heavily criticized for years with fewer and fewer official sources recommending it due to its immediate and later side effects. it is entirely possible that it has made your friend's condition worse but i cannot say for sure having only a limited amount of information.

Actual Doctor's Response:
medicare counts as qualifying insurance coverage and once you're eligible you won't need any additional insurance. you also have the right to turn down your employer's offer of insurance -- they can't force you to buy it. once you have medicare (make sure you sign up for parts a b and c to be fully covered) you can drop your employer's insurance if you feel the coverage is too expensive for you.

an allergy to your own urine is not possible. your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the only way you can have this problem properly diagnosed. this is not something that can be done blindly over the internet based solely on a vague description. having a sympathetic female physician pa or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit. have a trusted friend go with you. your doctor can even provide you with a short-acting anti-anxiety medication to help you overcome your fear. in most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have hundreds of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed.

Patient Question:
do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.

Patient Question:
why do teens need at least eight hours of sleep?

Actual Doctor's Response:
does your teen get fewer than eight hours? if so listen up: your teen is more at risk for obesity and all the health problems connected to that (high blood pressure heart disease stroke etc. ). the link between sleep deprivation and a higher risk for obesity and related cardiovascular problems may not seem obvious. but here’s the key: when you’re sleep deprived (and yes for the vast majority of teens fewer than eight hours on a regular basis qualifies as being sleep deprived) you’ll crave high carbohydrate foods — especially those that are loaded with fat salt and sugar. i know it’s not fair to crave junk food when we’re already lacking in the sleep department but you can blame our ancient dna on this fact. encoded in our genes are signals to eat like this when we’re tired. hormones that control our signals of hunger and conversely fullness get thrown out of whack when we are sleep deprived. in a new study published this month in the journal sleep researchers determined that teens can’t escape this hard-wired reality that adults are saddled with. though plenty of studies in recent years have implicated obesity with sleep deprivation in adults not many have been performed on younger generations to find similar associations. in this latest study researchers found sleep-deprived teens: * consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fat. * ate more snacks than those who slept eight hours or more a night. * ate more total calories. and you know what that spells: weight gain. when we think of adolescents losing out on sleep our minds quickly turn to potential accidents and an inability to concentrate or perform well in school. studies like this highlight the health consequences of sleep deprivation. the health repercussions of sleep deprivation at this “tender” age may actually be worse than those of an adult. for starters teens are establishing habits they will keep for a lifetime. a teen who gets used to eating poorly and packing on the pounds will likely grow into an overweight adult when it’ll be that much harder to change those habits and lose the excess weight. the more fatty foods you eat the more you crave them. secondly we’re only beginning to understand the biomechanics of a developing person’s metabolism. do teens who begin to have metabolic disturbances early in life suffer from a lifetime of irreversible higher health risks? it wouldn’t surprise me. and those higher risks may go far beyond just obesity and cardiovascular challenges. they may in fact go as far as upping the risk for cancer. so thirdly it’s a foregone conclusion: teens need their sleep as much as adults do.

remember your first step? what a fuss everyone made! and then you continued to walk right on through childhood adolescence and into adulthood but somewhere along the way like most adults you probably stopped walking so much. in fact the percentage of adults who spent most of their day sitting increased from 36. 8% in 2000 to 39. 9% in 2005! part of the reason may be your hectic stressful life with not a moment to spare for recreation or formal exercise. the environment plays a part too; inactivity has been engineered into our lives from escalators to remote controls to riding lawn mowers to robotic vacuum cleaners to electric toothbrushes to the disappearance of sidewalks and safe places to walk. but research shows that all this automation is bad for our health. inactivity is the second leading preventable cause of death in the united states second only to tobacco use. you'd think a simple activity like walking would be just that simple. but fewer than 50% of american adults do enough exercise to gain any health or fitness benefits from physical activity. is walking our salvation? i don't know for sure but evidence suggests that it's probably a good start.

when a woman is pregnant for 9 months does she save 9 eggs for 9 future ovulations?

Actual Doctor's Response:
thank you for the interesting question. i completely understand your logic. the laws are changing every day in the field of fertility. in the lab setting it has become common practice to increase the number of potentially viable eggs therby expanding the odds of pregnancy occurring. another example of these changes may be seen in the long held belief that a woman is born with a finite quantity of eggs at birth. this principle is being questioned in an animal study. please open the following link to a webmd article that discusses that study. <link> - although i’m not an expert in fertility issues i’ll share with you what i know to be accurate as follows: the number of follicles that will ever become a mature egg is partially dependent on the monthly cycle where a varying and undetermined number of follicles (potentially mature eggs) estimated to probably be in the neighborhood of 1 000 is lost. this follicle loss is also influenced by hormonal variations. the number of follicles remaining each month after the monthly cycle will influence the potential number of mature eggs in a woman’s lifetime. the more follicles that are lost monthly the sooner that the follicle supply will become exhausted and menopause will begin. with all of the advances in fertility it does not seen yet possible to calculate the number of remaining mature eggs after the monthly cycle.

Model's Recommendation:
Similarity Score: 1.0000
there is no saving of 9 eggs during pregnancy. a woman is born with a one-time allotment of about 400 000 follicles (potential eggs). only about 480 of these follicles will ever become mature eggs. during each monthly cycle one egg is released from the ovary. one month it's released from the right ovary and the next month from the left ovary. no eggs are released during pregnancy and breast feeding. after pregnancy and breast feeding the monthly cycle continues with the release of another mature egg from the remaining allocation.

how does scoliosis affect the immune system? . my daughter was born with spina bifida occulta. her cord is tethered but did not protrude or leave a whole at birth. after chronic pain she it was found at 3 yrs old. at 4 she was diagnosed with scoliosis the dr said it was attributed to the spina bifida. she also has severe asthma and allergies to food medications and pollen/dust/etc. how do these affect her immune system and why? . she is often absent from school and stays sick for longer periods of time.

Actual Doctor's Response:
scoliosis as an independent entity does not change the immune system it is just a developmental anomaly shared by many. this is not to say that your daughter does not have an immune problem due to something else so her doctor would be the best judge of this -- someone who knows her complete medical history. her allergies and asthma and some of the medications used to control it can certainly have an influence but not the scoliosis.

Patient Question:
can you get hand foot and mouth disease more than once? . my 11 month son was diagnosed with this today and his doctor acted as if you can only contract this once although she did not specifically say that. she told me that children over the age of 4 are usually spared as they have most likely already had the disease in the past. i have never had this nor has my husband or my two daughters (10 and 5). just looking for any extra precautions that i may need to take.

Actual Doctor's Response:
most helpful answer exposure to an infectious disease like hand foot and mouth disease does not automatically mean that the exposed person will get it. your children may be at mild risk not likely you or your husband. the vast majority of children will not get hand foot and mouth disease ever again however there can be very rare cases when those skin lesions will surface again (milder the second time). this can be due to another similar viral species that causes identical skin lesions or a rare reactivation of the prior infection.

Actual Doctor's Response:
if the symptoms last for more than 24 hours if the diagnosis is uncertain if there is concern about dehydration or if the patient has underlying medical conditions that make them more fragile medical care should be accessed sooner rather than later. infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration and may not have as much reserve as an adult. if there is concern about dehydration or the inability to tolerate fluids a healthcare provider should be contacted. if nausea and vomiting are associated with pain fever vomiting blood or having bloody or black tarry bowel movements medical care should be sought immediately. vomiting is a symptom of an illness and is not a disease in itself. if the symptom persists for more than 24 ro 48 hours it may be wise to contact a medical care provider.

diarrhea is a common symptom is usually self limited and usually requires only supportive care rest and clear fluids until it resolves. if the diarrhea persists diagnosis of the cause and further care may be needed. blood in the stool is never normal and should always be evaluated. the blood may be from a bleeding hemorrhoid; however other serious causes of bleeding need to be investigated. colitis is not the only cause of rectal bleeding. other causes include diverticulitis colon polyps anal fissures or cancer. chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration and if severe enough dehydration may require treatment with fluids. the symptoms of dehydration may include: lightheadedness (dizziness) especially when going from the sitting or lying positions to the upright position. weakness. dry mouth. decreased output of urine. high fever associated with diarrhea may be a warning sign that a significant infection is present and may need evaluation by a health care practitioner and treatment. abdominal pain is not normal and while diarrhea may be associated with mild cramps if a person has moderate or severe abdominal pain he or she should seek medical care.

unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis. a diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment. knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash. based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria (hives). hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persist/spread. regardless of the cause (which can be very challenging to find) the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or other over-the-counter medications in this class. seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives. this sounds like pitariasis rosea. which usually spreads to the trunk of the body. bathe in selson blue it could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wern't aware of may be in your yard? some body's house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like i have going on with me. but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash. i'm just using over the counter anti-itch cream good luck.

Actual Doctor's Response:
doctors aren’t sure but they believe that certain individuals have immune systems that are more able to fight off the viruses and prevent warts from growing. also just as some people are more likely to get poison ivy the genetic makeups and immune systems of certain individuals make them more susceptible to the viruses that cause skin warts. it is also common to see warts on multiple siblings in the same family. and children of people who had skin warts as children are often quite susceptible to skin warts themselves says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. still experts have yet to determine exactly what is different in the immune systems of people who get skin warts frequently.

this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!

Patient Question:
what is orthostatic hypotension?

Actual Doctor's Response:
when a person stands up from sitting or lying down the body must work to adjust to that change in position. it is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. if the body fails to do this adequately blood pressure falls and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure). adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: a heart strong enough to pump. arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze. enough blood and fluid within the vessels. when the body changes position a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the cardiovascular system as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. the autonomic nervous system can be considered to "run in the background" of the body regulating body processes that we take for granted. there is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speed things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. these names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster your palms get sweaty your eyes dilate and your hair stands on end. acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. these two systems are in balance and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day. when the body moves to a standing position pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity which causes blood to flow towards the legs. almost immediately the sympathetic system is stimulated causing the heart rate to increase the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully and blood vessels to constrict or narrow. all of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs. without these changes gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain causing symptoms of lightheadedness or even passing out. orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness.

Patient Question:
what are neutrophils?

Actual Doctor's Response:
neutrophils are a type of white blood cell which fight infections. neutrophils circulate through the blood and are normally detected on routine complete blood count (cbc) tests as part of the white blood cell count. many more neutrophils are on standby in the bone marrow and clinging to blood vessel walls to be released into the blood if needed. neutrophils are the “first responders” when the body is invaded by bacteria viruses or other organisms. guided by chemical signaling they travel to the area of infection and attack. neutrophils contain tiny compartments called granules in which they store toxic chemicals that act as their weapons against microorganisms. these substances are effective at killing bacteria and viruses but also contribute to inflammation with swelling redness and often pain. a low neutrophil count can be caused by drugs (especially chemotherapy) immune disorders and problems in the bone marrow. a very low neutrophil count increases the risk of serious infection.

Similarity Score: 0.9843
platelets are cell fragments derived from bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes. platelets circulate in blood but are much smaller than red or white blood cells. platelets are coated with substances that normally glide smoothly along the surface of blood vessels and other blood cells. however when platelets encounter a damaged blood vessel they collect together in a plug to stop the bleeding. a blood clot then forms sealing the platelet plug. aspirin and other medicines like clopidogrel (plavix) interfere with platelets’ ability to clump together. this helps protect against the sudden formation of blood clots inside blood vessels (the cause of heart attacks and strokes). antiplatelet drugs also increase the likelihood of abnormal or excessive bleeding.

Actual Doctor's Response:
the word "clear" may be referring to two things: one would be listening to the lungs and not hearing any abnormal sounds like crackling that would indicate pneumonia. another would be a clear x-ray; pneumonia not being radiologically proven. it is nice to have both to prove the diagnosis but medical provider often treat things provisionally (feeling they are high risk like your mother and likely to get pneumonia) or clinically (having all of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia without any confirmation). your mother may have been admitted because of her age her medical history and the fact that she was getting worse. pneumonia may just be the admitting diagnosis but may not end up being her final diagnosis.

can methylpredisolone tablets cause the recent outbreak of meningitis

Actual Doctor's Response:
the ongoing meningitis outbreak is scary and people are very confused about its cause. the current fungal meningitis outbreak is related to contaminated vials of an injectable steroid preparation called methylprednisolone acetate which is used to treat spinal pain. that means the people currently affected by fungal meningitis are those who received injections from a tainted vial of steroid preparation. (note: the investigation into this situation is ongoing and more medications may have been implicated by the time you read this. ) in addition to date all of the contaminated product has been linked to a single compounding pharmacy called new england compounding center (necc). all products made by necc are currently under recall by the food and drug administration. methylprednisolone oral tablets also are a steroid compound. these tablets are used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions among other things. to date methylprednisolone tablets have not been linked to any cases of fungal meningitis. as long as your tablets didn't come from necc (which is probably the case; most methylprednisolone tablets are mass-produced in factories) you should be safe. if you have any concerns about this contact your pharmacist or the prescribing physician. i hope you find this information useful.

melatonin actually has some data in regards to children dosing. anywhere from 2-5 milligrams could be used in a child but once again we want to find out why is the child not sleeping. pediatrician should always be consulted first before even starting any types of medications like this. it could be related to possibly they are starting school they are anxious maybe they are not sleeping at night because their room is noisy. so we have to find out really what are the root causes of the problems rather than go right ahead to medicating them. so as a pharmacist i would say to patients you know what let's talk to the pediatrician first and let's see what's going on before we start a child on melatonin. you know with most of these products once again we don't really have a lot of data to go by. so we don't know long-term use in some of these products how it's going to affect the child. children are not little adults. a lot of people i think are confused by that. their livers and their kidneys are not developed like yours and mine. so when they get a drug or they get any type of product in them they are going to react a lot differently than we are. so we want to make sure that people exercise caution.

yes i can tell you from personal experience that it can and does. just keep staying away from the stuff. there's a lot of people who don't feel like that and they will pressure you and pressure you to keep smoking it but you have to just not smoke it. it's still gonna be in your system for awhile. if you just don't smoke it in time the symptoms will get milder and milder and will eventually dissipate. just do not smoke that sh%* anymore and you will be fine trust me.

Actual Doctor's Response:
sperm can remain alive and viable for about three to five days if protected in the cervical mucous. is it really that important on which day you became pregnant? if it is an exact date of conception may be a difficult to determine based solely on isolated days of unprotected sex.

Patient Question:
how can benign prostatic hyperplasia bph be prevented?

Actual Doctor's Response:
the urination problems caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) cannot be prevented. some people believe that regular ejaculations will help prevent prostate enlargement. but there is no scientific proof that ejaculation helps. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) such as heartburn can be uncomfortable or even painful. you may be able to prevent these symptoms by making lifestyle changes such as losing weight if needed not smoking not using alcohol and avoiding certain foods that cause gerd symptoms such as chocolate. some medicines may cause reflux and heartburn as a side effect. if medicines you are taking seem to be the cause of your heartburn talk with your doctor. do not stop taking a prescription medicine until you talk with your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Patient Question:
uti symptoms. i went to the doctors because i thought i had the flu. they told me i had a uti. i have had a uti in the past and i had to pee all the time burning blood in my urine but i had my energy. it was more annoying than anything. today my symptoms are headache no energy at all pressure behind my eyes and nauseated. i never would have thought i had a uti again i have no problems or discomfort "down there". . how can a uti only cause problems/pain in your head and no where else in your body?

Actual Doctor's Response:
hi sounds like you have an upper uti should take about 5 days to get over if your doctor has given you no drugs try paracetamol or what ever you americans us instead also try this taking methenamine hippurate is an alternative to antibiotics. methenamine hippurate works by changing the chemical composition of your urine making it "less attractive" to bacteria. this info is from the uk's nhs. hope it helps you. good luck

Patient Question:
i have severe sinus headaches that are unaffected by ibuprofen zyrtecd and a nasal steroid. i take a nasal steroid spray nearly year round and i take zyrtec d to try and keep myself from all the awful symptoms. recently though the zyrtec hasn't been clearing the nasal inflamation when i have a headache. i will then take ibuprofen on top of that and it fails to work on the aching pain in my nose eye cavities cheeks and upper gums. in the last few days my nose has started to go cold on top of everything else. i'd appreciate any ideas.

Actual Doctor's Response:
i recommend seeing your doctor. i have the same symptoms which for me is chronic sinus infection. see your doctor soon.
