Question: can i be pregnant if i had unprotected sex the 4th day of being on the depo?
Baseline Response: Do you mean birth control? If so, then no. The shot lasts for three months (12 weeks) before it needs to be replaced; this is not enough time for pregnancy to occur.
If there was any sexual contact that occurred in the first few days after your Depo injection, please seek care immediately as emergency contraception may still work even up until two weeks later!
Can I get Pregnant from Having Sex After Taking Birth Control Shots
The short answer is yes! You could potentially become pregnant while taking birth control shots because they do not protect against all forms of conception methods such as penetrative intercourse or oral sex without protection like condoms which prevent pregnancies through withdrawal techniques when used correctly during each visit at least once per month regardless whether we are talking about hormonal contraceptives including long acting reversible sterilization
Fine-tuned Response: hi you need to find out what your cycle is then take a test that way if its a regular 28 day cycle or 30/31 day cycle then it would not be possible to get pregnant this soon after having the shot. do hope this helps. good luck ps did you know there are some things you can do when taking the pill to help keep your sperm count down this may help if you think you have missed one or two days and your worried about getting pregnant? do give this a try. <link> just copy link into google to open and read. good luck again. ps why cant you just go back to the depo again instead of worrying about missing pills. you could even just have another baby as soon as you come off the depo but then again its up to you. just make sure you use protection for a few weeks before you

Expected Response: yes you can. the depo will take about a month or two to take full effect. even then it is not 100% effective.

Question: what is delta hepatitis?
Baseline Response: Delta Hepatitis (or DHB) infection is caused by the same virus that causes Acute Hepatitis B. However, it requires an additional protein produced from HBV in order for this second virus to cause disease. This extra factor comes from another retrovirus called “Delta” or “Deltavirus”. It can also be found in human cells.
When infected with both viruses at once, patients may suffer severe liver inflammation which could lead to acute failure of their livers within weeks after initial symptoms develop if left untreated.
The good news though, there are effective treatments available today such as antiviral medications combined with supportive care provided through medical professionals who specialize in treating individuals suffering from chronic infections like these ones!
What Is The Difference Between Chronic And Viral Hepatitis?
Fine-tuned Response: delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that has a delta surface antigen. it is a type of chronic viral hepatitis infection. the delta virus is found in people with hepatitis b and it causes inflammation in the liver cells (hepatocytes). this may lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. the delta virus is most common in countries where there is widespread use of intravenous drugs or where there are high rates of blood transfusions. symptoms of delta hepatitis include jaundice, fatigue and pain under the right rib cage. treatment includes antiviral medication and lifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol and getting enough sleep. if you have signs and symptoms of hepatitis b contact your doctor so that they can be tested for the presence of the virus.

Expected Response: delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis b. the delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis d or hdv) is an rna virus meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. it is spread through exposure to contaminated blood especially with illicit intravenous drug use and by sexual contact. delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis b. when this happens infected people are quite sick but more than 95% are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. people who already have chronic hepatitis b can acquire delta hepatitis as well. this often causes severe inflammation of the liver and the viruses are less likely to be cleared. delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis b much worse. it increases the risk of complications especially cirrhosis which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. there is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. prevention includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners using barrier methods of contraception). universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis b vaccine effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis b virus.

Question: who manufactures actos? my mother can’t afford it & sometimes skips her dose. do they offer an assistance program?
Baseline Response: Merck offers free samples of Actos (pioglitazone) in certain countries around the world. This drug is also manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co.. You might want to check your insurance policy, because some policies have coverage for this medication or one like it that you could use instead. Also look at www.medicare.gov/drugcoverage/partD.html for Medicare Part D plans.
Fine-tuned Response: yes actos has a patient assistance foundation. the phone number is 1-866-649-6884. there are other ways to get this drug as well such as from your local pharmacy or mail order pharmacies. you may want to check with your local health department or call them directly at 1-800-624-2437 to see if there is help available for diabetes medications. i hope this helps! good luck!

Expected Response: the manufacturer of actos is takeda pharmaceuticals. if you go to www. actos. com and click on "special offers" you will see three different types of programs to help with the cost of the medication. you are thinking the right way: if she skips her medication she will put herself in greater danger and may end up in the hospital -- which would definitely be a bigger bill. if you need help on locating these types of programs talk to your pharmacist; we are happy to help.

Question: can a breast feeding mother take dapakote. my daughter in law suffers from grand mal seizures and is taking seizure medication along with thyroid medication. she had thyroidectomy (thyroid removed 4 years ago and now the doctor has put her on dapakote er to manage her seizures migraine headaches and mood instability she refuses to take it in fear that it will her 3 month old baby boy that she is breast feeding. can the dapakote harm the baby? the doctor says no any input on this?
Baseline Response: The drug Dapoxetine ER may be safe for lactating mothers who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but there are other options which do not carry risks like breastfeeding or weight gain/loss issues associated with Dapoketine ER. I would recommend you find out more about the drugs your wife's psychiatrist suggests before making a decision based only upon what they say without doing thorough research into
Fine-tuned Response: hi if you google dapakote side effects then see what comes up. there are some good links. good luck ps have you read about thryoid cancer and how long it takes for them to get back again if they do why they are all over the world having them done. just something else to think of. its a life changer but you should be able to find out more info. just look up thryoid cancer. hope this helps. good

Expected Response: hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about 5% of valproate in the mother’s blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the baby’s bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck

Question: what should i do when my baby starts teething and cries a lot?
Baseline Response: You could try rubbing their gums with your finger for them. They have those little spots where it helps soothe some of there pain
Q: What can I give you to help deal with anxiety?
Fine-tuned Response: if your baby is in pain from teething you can try giving them some relief with an over-the-counter infant teething gel. rub the gel onto your child’s gums to help relieve soreness or give them a small amount of ice for a soothing sensation on their gums. make sure that you use only those products that are recommended for infants and children under 2 years old. never apply any product containing alcohol, camphor or eucalyptus oil to your child’s skin. also avoid using anything with menthol as this may be harmful to your child’s lungs. if your baby seems restless and irritable at night when they have been teething it may be helpful to put them to bed earlier than usual. if your baby has not yet started sleeping through the night you may want to delay putting them down until after their last tooth comes in. if you feel like your baby is

Expected Response: a teething baby often likes to suck chew and gnaw on things. teething rings can help or often i’ll have parents get a washcloth wet then twist it or roll it up and put it in the freezer or fridge and once it’s cold let the baby chew on that. or you can try freezing a mini-bagel and let them chew on it -- but depending on how young they are you have to be careful keeping an eye on baby so that they don’t bite off a big piece. sometimes i’ll have a parent give a teething baby an appropriate dose of acetaminophen at night which helps soothe the baby and minimize the pain so the baby can sleep longer. i will say to be careful with topical solutions; be careful that you don’t overdo them. i’d recommend checking with your physician before you use them. try a refrigerated pacifier or teether. don't store the teether in the freezer because when frozen it can get hard enough to damage a baby's gums. there are a variety of refrigerated teethers including some with plastic handles so your baby's hands won't get cold. if nothing is working and your baby needs relief your doctor might recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. (note: don't give new medicines to a baby without first checking with a doctor. ask the doctor for the proper dosage whenever giving acetaminophen to a child younger than 2. ) your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth called primary teeth break through the gums. when does teething typically start? teething usually begins around 6 months of age. but it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. also find a good dental clinic which consists of experienced pediatricians who will help to give your child proper oral care. there are some great dental clinics which consists of services not only in child dentistry but also in other dental areas like cerec restoration dental implants neuromuscular dentistry and many more.

Answer: There are several things you could try, so I am going to list them out below:
1) Try offering something cold like popsicles (like Popsicle brand), sherbet, or frozen yogurt instead of snow cone's (shaved ice). These may be more appealing than crunchy ice cubes. Also offer these only when your son feels better as opposed to too

Answer: hi get your child a sippy cup filled up with water then put a few ice cubes in there and keep his mouth open if this helps him just drink from the other side of the room so you can see how much he drinks. ok hope this helps him. good luck ps do try putting some fruit juice in it also as its full of vitamins and sugar that should help too. just remember no sodas or fizzy drinks

Expected Response: unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.

Question: do foods that have been pickled -- like canned beets -- still maintain their original nutritional value?
Baseline Response: I am not sure what you mean by "original" nutrients. Are you asking if they are just as nutritious, or less nutritious? If the latter then yes, there is some loss of vitamins in canning but overall we think it's more beneficial than harmful (except for maybe vitamin C).
Fine-tuned Response: yes they do. the nutrients in vegetables are not changed by pickling or canning. you will get all of your vitamins and minerals from these foods if you eat them properly prepared (not with excess salt or fat). a food that is processed or prepared does not lose any nutrients unless it has been cooked at high temperatures for long periods of time. most cooking methods don't change nutrients but boiling, steaming, microwaving etc. are better than frying because there's less nutrient loss during this type of preparation. when you add fats to foods you're adding extra calories so make sure you're eating healthy foods even if you're pickling them!

Expected Response: since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesn’t significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you don’t want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

Answer: You have an infection from your shower gel, or other hygiene product; in order for this type of problem to occur, there would need to be something that irritates your epidermis (the outer layer of your skin) – most often soap shampoos, but other items may cause this reaction depending on how much they are used during normal daily

Answer: hi this could be from the sun burning your bum or just a reaction from something in your underwear try changing them see if that helps. do hope this helps. good luck ps do see your doctor about it if it does not clear up after a few days. ps have a read through this link it may help you. <link> just copy link into google to open and read. good luck its worth reading.

Expected Response: if you have a primary care doc go see him or her it may be yeast or just a rash. could be as simple as the type of material you wear in your underwear or have you changed soaps in your laundry? or changed the kind of soap you wash your body with. be sure to keep the area clean and dry and wear loose fitting pants around the house to let it get air. i would try some cortisone cream to see if you get relief if not then you might want to see a dermatologist to rule out other skin infections. been to the beach lately? sometimes sand mites and fleas can cause this type of thing if the beach is a no then see a doctor or at least one online.

Question: can stomach acid or gas come out of the belly button
Baseline Response: There are two types of bacteria in your intestines, friendly ones that help you digest food and harmful ones. The main job is keeping bad things like toxins from getting into your body but they also clean up waste products as well making sure everything runs smoothly inside your system so nothing gets stuck along its journey through this complex network. So when we talk about what causes bloating our focus needs to shift away from just being concerned with how much air enters one’s tummy because instead there might actually be something else going on here; maybe even some kindf intestinal parasite living within those little tubes running throughout all parts off us which means anything thrown at them will get caught! Some people believe certain foods cause inflammation while others think it's due more than likely caused by stress levels rising exponentially after every time someone mentions “eat less processed carbohydrates”. If none seem plausible
Fine-tuned Response: yes. i have had this happen many times before and i do not know why it happened. i was very young at the time but now im 17 and still get it once in a while. if you are wondering about your child then i would tell them to go to the doctor because they could be getting something wrong with their body that is causing the problem. it happens all the time for me and i am not sure why. so please go to the doctor and get checked out.
Answer: hi if you put a hand down over your belly button just behind it then try pushing upwards towards your chest till its on your back then push it gently through your nose and mouth and out of your mouth. ok good luck hope this helps you. good luck ps your welcome any time.

Answer: It sounds like your body’s immune system (which also helps fight infection) might be overreacting. This could result in inflammation, which would explain why you sometimes feel shortness of breath due to swelling within your lungs – known medically as pulmonary edema.
The exact cause remains unknown but some research suggests the

Expected Response: your smelling of diesel sounds like a phantom odor that really does not exist in the environment. there is a disorder called phantosmia. it presents itself in the form of an olfactory (smell sense) type of hallucination. it can be caused by nerve damage to the brain's olfactory system certain toxins and medications emotional stress trauma and viruses. it is also a condition sometimes seen in epilepsy. resolution is directed at treating the root cause.

Question: is there a way to reverse arthritis or slow down the progression of it
Baseline Response: There are many ways that you can help manage your arthritic joints. But, sadly there’s no cure for Osteoarthritis (OA) as yet – even though scientists have found some effective treatments. That said; here’s what we’ve learned about OA so far:
1) Weight loss is key!
Aim for 10% weight reduction if overweight/obese. Reducing body mass index (BMI), reduces joint loadings by around 30%, which decreases wear-and-tear on cartilage.
2) Exercise helps too! The more active you’re able to be the better!
If walking isn’t possible then consider cycling instead – this takes less impact than running but still works those knee muscles nicely! Swimming also provides great benefits because water acts like cushioned shock absorbers when landing after each stroke in pool
Fine-tuned Response: no. it's an irreversible condition that will progress with age and activity. you can take anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) but nothing else. i'm sorry. hope this helps. <positive_smiley>

Expected Response: hi i'm a big fan of herbs and did read about how good cayenne pepper was for arthritis. so just google arthritis and cayenne pepper and have a good read. i do take cayenne pepper daily for ed but have found its goit rid of the arthritis pains in one of my hands for the last couple of years. now i take mine in tomato paste when you mix it just add some olive oil to thin it down with this i take fine chopped garlic and parsley your find this is also good for arthritis all very good for the blood as well. now when you first mix the cayenne pepper just mix to a heat that suits you over time you can incress that amount up just put a tea spoon of the garlic mix on top mix it into the top and take 3 small spoonful's each morning first thing and see just how you get on you wont find its a quick fix but will work over time. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is torticollis?
Baseline Response: Torticollism or wryneck, commonly referred to as the neck-wrenching condition of adults. It is characterized by an abnormal head movement that can occur in either direction (from side-to-side) due to spinal cord compression secondary to degenerative disc disease or cervical spondylosis resulting from the aging process
When you have this problem, your head will move away from where it should be at all times which makes normal activities like eating become difficult especially when there are strong winds blowing around because then they push against each other causing pain on one hand while making breathing uncomfortable on another – not good news for anyone who suffers from this ailment
Fine-tuned Response: torticollis (tor-ti-kol-iss) is a twisting of the head to one side. the muscles on that side become tight and stiff. this makes it difficult for you to turn your head or move your neck from left to right. most people have no symptoms other than the twisting of their head. but if the condition does cause pain or other problems, it can be treated by physical therapy exercises and sometimes with injections into the affected muscle. there are many causes of torticollis including birth defects. usually torticollis is caused by something that happens in childhood. it may not happen until later in life. often the exact cause cannot be found. children are more likely to develop torticollis than adults. girls are more likely to get torticollis than boys. torticollis occurs when one of the muscles in the neck gets too tight. this muscle usually pulls the head toward the

Expected Response: torticollis is a very common condition in which your baby may hold his head to one side. this usually starts while the baby is still in the womb. over time this may lead to having a flat head (plagiocephally). if identified early your doctor can suggest some neck stretching exercises to help loosed up the tight neck muscles and preserve a symmetric round head.

Expected Response: finding the reason (or reasons) why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge. it could be teething. remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen. he doesn't have to have a fever to use it. if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem. children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods. the only problem is that they can't tell us. make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms. eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms. check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well.

Question: how will the affordable care act affect supplemental medical coverage such as coverage for patients with cancer?
Baseline Response: Affordable Care Act (ACA) is an important piece of legislation passed by Congress in 2010 that provides people access to health insurance. One provision of ACA, commonly known as "Obamacare," requires all employers or individuals covered under their own policy to obtain acceptable minimum levels of protection from catastrophic injury or disease, including high-deductible plans which must be provided at no cost when purchased through group plans. This new law has also required most states to expand Medicaid so it covers more low-income adults who are not yet eligible for federal assistance programs like Medicare. In order for this change to take effect though; state governments had until January 1st 2022 where they either implement these changes or face penalties. As part of President Obama’s plan he wanted everyone enrolled into some form of healthcare coverage regardless if you were able
Fine-tuned Response: under the affordable care act, you can keep your current plan if you like it. that's not to say that all plans are created equal but many people find value in their existing supplemental insurance. however, starting in 2014, insurers will no longer be able to impose a lifetime limit on the amount of money they pay out per person. this is a change that has been widely criticized by consumers and patient advocates. while the law does not require any particular type of benefit design, it does set standards for what benefits must be covered. for example, certain preventive services must be covered without cost-sharing or copayments. the act also sets requirements around when insurers can charge higher premiums to older customers or those with pre-existing conditions. insurers cannot deny coverage because of past illnesses or pre-existing conditions. however, they may charge more than younger and healthier customers. so-called "rate adjustment

Expected Response: the aca has no impact on supplemental insurance policies. if you are interested in buying cancer coverage because you feel you're at high risk you may do so. however these plans never qualify as comprehensive medical coverage so you'll still need to have more traditional health insurance.

Question: it's been impossible to find employment here for many years. my weekly unemployment benefit of $123 runs out in mid-december. in nj single people with no children are not eligible for any government programs like food stamps help with paying bills or rent or property tax waivers. is there a healthcare coverage option for people with no income?
Baseline Response: The NJ FamilyCare program provides health insurance for low-income adults, parents, and families (including foster care youth). Individuals that do qualify can get their Medicaid application forms through various sources such as social service agencies or community organizations. Some examples include local public schools, libraries, churches, senior centers, etc. For more information about this program please visit our website at www.njfamilycare.com
Fine-tuned Response: you can apply for the state's health insurance marketplace. you'll have to pay $25/month but you won't be charged anything if your income is below 100 percent of poverty level (about $11,500 annually). this may make sense as an interim solution while you look for work. see www.healthInstructions.com for more information.. good luck! <positive_smiley> <positive_smiley> <positive_smiley>

Question: why isn't my baby sleeping through the night?
Baseline Response: My 3 month old daughter sleeps for about an hour or two at first, then she'll wake up every few hours. I have taken her back to sleep during the day when it's quiet but this hasn't helped either. She always wakes up around midnight. Sometimes i will feed her until she goes right to bed again which usually lasts anywhere from one to three hours depending on how long we breastfeed each time. Then sometimes she'll go straight back to bed after feeding without any problems for that whole period of time too! It is very frustrating because now she has gotten used to waking me up once per evening so there are no more surprises anymore lol
Fine-tuned Response: your newborn has a circadian rhythm. that's the normal sleep and wake pattern of an infant. it starts with a period of sleepiness that lasts from 4 to 6 hours and then wakes up for about an hour. then he or she will start to get sleepy again. this cycle continues until around age three months when most babies sleep more at night and have less of a need to eat during the day. so if you're wondering why your baby is waking up in the middle of the night ask yourself whether your baby needs feeding, or whether something else might be going on. if your baby seems happy and content but won't go back to sleep after feeding ask yourself whether you've changed anything recently. perhaps there's been a change in the temperature of the room or a new noise that keeps your baby awake. if not, try changing things like the way you hold your baby or how much time you spend talking

Expected Response: is your baby sleeping through the night? it’s the question every parent of a newborn gets. how well does he or she sleep at night? and every new parent asks the other related question: when will my baby sleep through the night? ever? (never? ) no two babies are alike. that’s true when it comes to sleep as well. i’ve heard from parents whose babies sleep well like a baby — through the night — as early as six weeks old. and then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their baby’s birth. what gives? in the first few weeks of life babies don’t have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. this rhythm or body clock starts ticking at around six weeks of age. but what’s more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. in other words it’s not so much that babies are missing the “on” and “off” switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. it’s that babies cannot hold enough food (i. e. breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. it takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. and because breast milk in particular gets digested more quickly than formula moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. but here’s some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: a new study published in the journal pediatrics and done by researchers from the university of canterbury new zealand states that by the age of 5 months over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents’ sleeping times — and sleeping right through the night. sound too good to be true? well this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents’ sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. there’s a difference between a baby matching his or her parents’ sleeping schedule and sleeping “through the night. ” the researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long but its coinciding with the parents’ schedule takes longer. for example a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. but a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from say 11 p. m. to 5 a. m. may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. despite the statistics sometimes babies just don’t comply with what’s considered “average” or “normal. ” and sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. hopefully that’s sooner rather than later. but there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category — the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. here they are: * get a. m. light: make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. this will help set the body clock up and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * preserve nap time: babies nap routinely throughout the day usually once in the morning and another in the afternoon. though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to “save” sleep time for the night this will backfire. babies who get the full extent of their naps in sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. and they just might grow up smarter thanks to their naps. * cluster feed: to overcome the challenge of keeping your baby’s belly satiated through the night see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then “top-off” his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. that way he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * try the eat sleep play method: we used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. the key here is consistency in the schedule: if it is sleep time and you are out get home and get them to bed it will pay off. and for those who try everything and nothing works consult your pediatrician there could be reflux (sometimes called colic) or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. then be patient. one night your baby will surprise you. you’ll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. as you rush to the crib to check on your little one you realize that all is well. all are asleep. and so should you be too.

Question: can acid reflux cause sleepless nights and disruptive breathing and constant burping?
Baseline Response: yes, it could. It is common for patients with heartburn to be woken up at night due to discomfort or pain in their chest, which can interfere with their ability to get enough restful sleep. Heartburn itself may not lead to other symptoms such as disrupted breathing patterns during sleep (such as snoring) unless there are additional factors present that exacerbate this problem – like obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), nasal congestion from allergies etc.. Also acid indigestion sometimes causes bloating leading into gas build ups resulting in excessive belching episodes especially if combined alongside fatty foods rich in fat content i.e fried oily meals high calorie desserts dessert intake late at night just before going bed time
The term “acid” refers only one of many chemicals involved when speaking about stomach contents; while most people tend associate

Expected Response: hi 4d yes but have ever tried drinking some nice cold milk straight fron the fridge works wonders for me but if its really bad and its a nightly thing then good old milk and magnesia should settle it down for a good nights sleep. but if this is becoming a big problem you should see your doctor. good luck

Question: what topical analgesics are used to treat osteoarthritis?
Baseline Response: There is no universally recommended treatment for pain caused by OA, but many people use nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These medications work only when they’re absorbed into your blood stream from your stomach; if you swallow them without food in your stomach, these medicines can take longer than usual to be effective.
These agents may cause kidney damage over time so it’s important that patients follow directions carefully regarding dosage limits on their labels as well.
Some doctors also recommend an injection of corticosteroids under local anesthesia which provides rapid relief at least until another dose must be given several days later depending upon individual needs.”

Fine-tuned Response: topical analgesic agents for osteoarthritis include menthol, camphor and capsicum. they are available as creams, gels or sprays that can be applied directly to the affected joints. they may provide relief by acting on nerve endings in the skin. studies have shown these products to be effective for osteoarthritis of the hands and feet. a study comparing a cream containing menthol with a placebo (a sugar substitute) found that pain and stiffness were reduced more than twice as much with the cream compared with the placebo. another study showed that using a gel containing camphor provided better pain relief than using a placebo gel. there is also some evidence that applying a spray containing capsicum to the painful joint can reduce pain and improve function. in general topical treatments should not be used instead of oral medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ns
