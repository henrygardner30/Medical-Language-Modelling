Question: what is delta hepatitis?
Answer: disease description: hepatitis delta also known as the hepatitis delta virus (hdv) is a “satellite” virus situated in the hepatitis b virus (hbv). the hepatitis d virus only replicates in the presence of hbv. hdv does not have an outer envelope. hepatitis d was first recognized in 1977 and was first known to be a fourth bile-transmitted virus along with hepatitis a b and non-a non-b and c types. recent studies suggest that hdv may be linked to other liver infections and functions via other liver-specific receptors. treatment: alpha interferon is the only proven effective therapy for chronic hepatitis d. a new antiviral nucleotide analog that should be effective against hepatitis b and d is in preceptor fda trials. durring 24 weeks of administration of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine in doses of 30 mg/day circulating hbsag should be cleared from the serum of the patient's blood and the hdv-rna should disappear from serum. in some patients the clearing of hbsag will not have an effect on liver inflammation and subject will need further therapy. engaging in behaviors such as not sharing drug needles tattoo equipment or razors that may be contaminated with infected blood through the following steps protection against hbv vaccination with hbv vaccine after infection may develop viral hepatitis e and cure hbeag combinations: for those who have a good liver but a positive hbsag recent hep d virus hbv dna positive alt value is in normal limits or low amounts of hbv dna less than 10 5 then it can be entered in combination with pegylated interferon and an antiviral drug after 48 weeks can be cultured off the drugs. exercise caution atitudes associated with hepatitis b such as love brothel or jail intimacy. use of condoms and dental dams. always a single use of injection syringes and needles. by donating blood eyes razor and toothbrush dressing sharing used materials with other people who may be infected like. preemptive medical check-ups when going abroad. giving birth to babies for pregnant women examination of prenatal care for hepatitis b and hiv is a part of normal procedures to check and clarify side effects or complications of the virus against the baby and newly emerging. contributing in cultural and sporting associations rather than extract and donate blood referring to hepatitis b disease vaccination donations in all social environments for solving contamination hindering. exercise caution on the toothbrush and dental drilling sharing items. doing blood and body fluids at schools companies where people live in colonies and people with high risks parental control in infrastructure which can infect with hbv like. retest of the people who were negative for hbsag after their first vaccination series against hbv that they did not respond and again at intervals those who did not respond repeat vaccinations of the vaccine can be protective through use booster doses. in the child's birth these babies need access to a medical institution with the hepatitis b immune globulin (hbig) administered with hepatitis b and vaccination. treatment of a face garbage as a natural component of the vaccine. hepatitis delta also referred to as the delta agent is a disease caused by the hepatitis d virus and results in a person becoming infected with the hepatitis d virus (hdv). hepatitis d virus (hdv) is structurally unrelated to the other hepatitis viruses and it requires its helper function from hepatitis b virus (hbv) for replication. very simply the virus needs help from the hepatitis b virus to reproduce. without the assistance of another virus the virus will die. it cannot exist alone. this is why people diagnosed with hdv are also always diagnosed with hepatitis b (because the hdv needs the hbv to survive). when a person is diagnosed with hdv and hbv it is called coinfection when a person is diagnosed with hepatitis d after already having hepatitis b for a few years it is called superinfection. there are very few treatments known to effectively work in eradicating hdv and because of that less than 5 percent of the people around the world that are diagnosed with hepatitis d will clear the virus. rats mice and monkeys all mammals can be infected with hepatitis d rats harboring hdv alone do not suffer hepatitis. human and wood chuck livers can be experimentally infected with hdv (the wood chuck model is very popular). the effects of coinfection are not as severe as the effects of a superinfection and some people actually recover from hdv all together. however when hepatitis d is diagnosed the mortality rate for children with hdv is 28. 5% and the rate for men with the virus is over 50%. in cases that become fulminant the diagnoses is often terminal. (source: paul b. beiers md) people are dying from the disease and research indicates that between 15% and 80% of the people in developing countries that have been diagnosed with hdv and hbv have deceased. there has not been a cure found to date so the emphasis must be on preventing the illness by vaccines and focusing on populations at risk.
Expected Response: delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis b. the delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis d or hdv) is an rna virus meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. it is spread through exposure to contaminated blood especially with illicit intravenous drug use and by sexual contact. delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis b. when this happens infected people are quite sick but more than 95% are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. people who already have chronic hepatitis b can acquire delta hepatitis as well. this often causes severe inflammation of the liver and the viruses are less likely to be cleared. delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis b much worse. it increases the risk of complications especially cirrhosis which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. there is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. prevention includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners using barrier methods of contraception). universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis b vaccine effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis b virus.

Question: can a breast feeding mother take dapakote. my daughter in law suffers from grand mal seizures and is taking seizure medication along with thyroid medication. she had thyroidectomy (thyroid removed 4 years ago and now the doctor has put her on dapakote er to manage her seizures migraine headaches and mood instability she refuses to take it in fear that it will her 3 month old baby boy that she is breast feeding. can the dapakote harm the baby? the doctor says no any input on this?
Answer: sometimes certain medications are needed for the mother to take (and often more) so they can take good care of their babies. look at all of the moms (including mine) who smoked during pregnancy not knowing the bad outcomes that could follow. i'd agree with the baby's doctor on this issue and you can confirm this information in any professional drug/nursing reference (like hale's medications in breastfeeding book) to allay any concerns. it would not be prudent for the mother just to pick and choose certain obstetrical-related medications so she should be her husband's "partner" in his good medical care; he's certainly not doing it for the baby.
Expected Response: hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about 5% of valproate in the mother’s blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the baby’s bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck

Question: what should i do when my baby starts teething and cries a lot?
Answer: answer: it has been awhile since i had to deal with a teething baby in the house but i can still remember. there's a reason we often take pics of sleeping babies during teething periods. usually a teething baby is a sleepless crying baby. lumpy bumpy class-says all natural right naked more or less just crying. i mean what else can you do right? babies cry and eating something cool is good but not on their skin.挘 you can however use a little dollop of ibuprophen too much but a small dollop on a q-tip=very good though. why boys are a little better then girls? it's not crying it's those 3 words it's all about age. what age is your baby? if your saying newborn then teething is not an issue. if she's over 6 months old then fine but what you are going to do? breast feed? cough drops maybe but be a man you got a baby now. what are uncle ears for? some sound advice. things you can not do: feed at will? no solid food is better? no it's too much care for the mother a tired mother is better. liquid is good. be nice but remember your goal is for her to start teethe c`mon if 98. 9 ain't high then there no teething? think about it and babies cry. the first couple of teeth are tough. ask your mother. these days teething rings are better and i would pop it in the frig for 30 minutes. would you like cold watermelon or a frozen steak? baby aspirin no like i said ibuprophen cold on the legs not just for the poor little one teething is tough on the mother and god forbid it's your first baby.挘 just hang in there and try to get some sleep it get`s better or worse there are teenagers....
Expected Response: a teething baby often likes to suck chew and gnaw on things. teething rings can help or often i’ll have parents get a washcloth wet then twist it or roll it up and put it in the freezer or fridge and once it’s cold let the baby chew on that. or you can try freezing a mini-bagel and let them chew on it -- but depending on how young they are you have to be careful keeping an eye on baby so that they don’t bite off a big piece. sometimes i’ll have a parent give a teething baby an appropriate dose of acetaminophen at night which helps soothe the baby and minimize the pain so the baby can sleep longer. i will say to be careful with topical solutions; be careful that you don’t overdo them. i’d recommend checking with your physician before you use them. try a refrigerated pacifier or teether. don't store the teether in the freezer because when frozen it can get hard enough to damage a baby's gums. there are a variety of refrigerated teethers including some with plastic handles so your baby's hands won't get cold. if nothing is working and your baby needs relief your doctor might recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. (note: don't give new medicines to a baby without first checking with a doctor. ask the doctor for the proper dosage whenever giving acetaminophen to a child younger than 2. ) your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth called primary teeth break through the gums. when does teething typically start? teething usually begins around 6 months of age. but it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. also find a good dental clinic which consists of experienced pediatricians who will help to give your child proper oral care. there are some great dental clinics which consists of services not only in child dentistry but also in other dental areas like cerec restoration dental implants neuromuscular dentistry and many more.

Question: my 3 year old just had his tonsiles removed. and he refusing to drink. can giving him a bath help with hydration? . he will crunch on shaved ice but i don't think he is getting enough to drink. he is eating baby food which i assume has some water to it but not much. he is in a lot of pain and we want to make sure he gets enough fluid. will letting him soak in a bath help at all. i know drinking water or gatorade etc is best but looking for some alternatives.
Answer: help! someone just please add a answer this this's question to get the result that gets me out of here! my suggestion to rehydrate a 3 three after tonsillectomy (odds are i don't have to tell you that your son will need ice cream and popsicles too) would be to make some very cool homemade slurpees. you can use anything high in water content (including baby food) along with some ice cubes and whirl them in a blender. although cherry is a no-no that doesn't mean an adult can't make one just for you. just let your son slurp one maybe even in the bathtub. i had a paper route to make a little money until i was 15. when i was about 10 i saved enough to buy (with a big bunch of shiny dimes nickels and pennies) a big plastic model of a saturn 5 rocket that was about 3' tall when it was completely built. i realized later on that i was hooked. turbines whirlers jets. nothing better. good luck with your son!
Expected Response: unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.

Question: do foods that have been pickled -- like canned beets -- still maintain their original nutritional value?
Answer: green olives are high in sodium. i would not call them a healthy choice. could be healthy if eaten in moderation. olive oil has been shown to have heart benefits but pretty sure that whole olives are a bit salt heavy. right sorry for the confusion. so green olives are not that healthy. although the mediterranean countries regard olive oil as a healthy choice. if you are making an italian salad the vinegar evens out the scales with the salt. but if you are on a low-salt diet you shouldn't eat too much salt anyways. being healthy is not really a choice. the things we eattreat our body. though salt is important keep it moderated. at your age some food group will be making your body just for some years then be the cause of the degradation of your body by wrong dietary living. it is a shock but it is our continuous indulgence to the wrong things and chronic negligence that speeds up the process. be observant to your body a workout after-eating session gives a good eye on this. salt an appropriate intake gives attraction to minerals in our body like iodine. too much is toxic. but sodium and some other minerals in salt is important for growth you never neglect the things the body need. salt as an electrolyte is vital for the transmission of nerve-impulses also the overall nerve function. of course salt also imparts flavors to the food. about eating olive? no problem. it has monounsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols that are good to heart health. just make sure you are not allergic to it. olive has proteins that sometimes cause the body to go on an over-react when once sensed by immune-system. be observant again to your body every reactions point straight to the problem. good luck god bless!
Expected Response: since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesn’t significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you don’t want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

Question: the skin below my left buttock is sensitive and also accompanied with some acne-like bumps. any suggestions? . a couple of days ago i started experiencing some sensitive skin under my left buttock. over several hours the sensitive-ness expanded closer to my genitals. having assumed it wasn't serious i let it be until today when i did a self-inspection. upon closer look i noticed some bumps which look like acne aswell as a small patch of skin which has peeled away - similar to what happens when you get sunburn. male 23 y/o
Answer: hi well if looks like normal acne its the hair folicles that are inflamed. how about just doing a few sitz baths this should help them clear. do hope this helps you. good luck
Expected Response: if you have a primary care doc go see him or her it may be yeast or just a rash. could be as simple as the type of material you wear in your underwear or have you changed soaps in your laundry? or changed the kind of soap you wash your body with. be sure to keep the area clean and dry and wear loose fitting pants around the house to let it get air. i would try some cortisone cream to see if you get relief if not then you might want to see a dermatologist to rule out other skin infections. been to the beach lately? sometimes sand mites and fleas can cause this type of thing if the beach is a no then see a doctor or at least one online.

Question: occasionally i have a 'condition' where i smell something similar to what diesel smells like every time i breathe. . when i inhale all i smell is what smells like diesel. this lasts for anywhere from three days to two weeks and it stops as suddenly as it starts. i have not noticed anything that specifically 'triggers' it. just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and what may be causing it and if i can do something to avoid or stop it. i have type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and severe asthma and not sure if any or all of these contribute to this.
Answer: your best bet would be to consult an md but the die-off from the otc supplement grapefruit seed extract sounds like it might be a possibility.
Expected Response: your smelling of diesel sounds like a phantom odor that really does not exist in the environment. there is a disorder called phantosmia. it presents itself in the form of an olfactory (smell sense) type of hallucination. it can be caused by nerve damage to the brain's olfactory system certain toxins and medications emotional stress trauma and viruses. it is also a condition sometimes seen in epilepsy. resolution is directed at treating the root cause.

Answer: the treatment will depend upon the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. for mild arthritis you can follow the changes to diet and routine that can reverse the effects of this crippling disease. exclude processed foods sugar and gluten and include organic vegetables grass-fed meat and fish in your diet. eat at scheduled times. improving gut functioning may also help in chronic diseases. include whole grains oatmeal etc to get high fiber content. herbs like boswellia curcuma withania may help to control arthritis. these herbal mix powder in equal proportion can be consumed at dose of 2-3 gms twice per day with lukewarm water.
Expected Response: hi i'm a big fan of herbs and did read about how good cayenne pepper was for arthritis. so just google arthritis and cayenne pepper and have a good read. i do take cayenne pepper daily for ed but have found its goit rid of the arthritis pains in one of my hands for the last couple of years. now i take mine in tomato paste when you mix it just add some olive oil to thin it down with this i take fine chopped garlic and parsley your find this is also good for arthritis all very good for the blood as well. now when you first mix the cayenne pepper just mix to a heat that suits you over time you can incress that amount up just put a tea spoon of the garlic mix on top mix it into the top and take 3 small spoonful's each morning first thing and see just how you get on you wont find its a quick fix but will work over time. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is torticollis?
Answer: torticollis is defined as "having something wrong with the neck muscle. having a twisted neck. " it's interesting to note that the term "torticollis" is not synonymous with "congenital torticollis. " it simply means "twisted neck. " it is a clinical proven fact that dr. ian malcolm patterson is the true leading clue on torticollis. he's unique abilities to diagnose treat and bring peace to children and families whom are affected by torticollis.
Expected Response: torticollis is a very common condition in which your baby may hold his head to one side. this usually starts while the baby is still in the womb. over time this may lead to having a flat head (plagiocephally). if identified early your doctor can suggest some neck stretching exercises to help loosed up the tight neck muscles and preserve a symmetric round head.

Question: 8mos old son had a fever for 4 days. used ibuprofen & it's now gone but he is constantly fussy which is not his norm? . a week ago my son had a fever when i got home from work. we used acetamenophen and ibuprofen to treat it. had more success with the ibuprofen. during the 4 days he had his fever he was miserable. didn't eat well or sleep well which is to be expected. now the fever is gone and he is still miserable. . . we returned to the md to see if he had something going on like & ear infection & were told he is fine. . . before this he was my happy little guy &now he is miserable and fussy no matter what we do.
Answer: hi i just posted back to you but both those can help. hands off and some coconut oil? time just time it will clear a lot quickly so long you stay of the ibuprofen and other meds they do slow things down. good luck
Expected Response: finding the reason (or reasons) why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge. it could be teething. remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen. he doesn't have to have a fever to use it. if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem. children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods. the only problem is that they can't tell us. make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms. eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms. check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well.

Question: how will the affordable care act affect supplemental medical coverage such as coverage for patients with cancer?
Answer: revered user many supporters of obamacare believe the health-care law -- also requires the rebates to reinforce other key parts of the legislation m high-risk pools run by the federal government and state health exchanges are examples. supporters say he also has advocated for broader changes to medicare including lower spending and turning it into a voucher-like program for future beneficiaries. i hope this really helps you. good luck
Expected Response: the aca has no impact on supplemental insurance policies. if you are interested in buying cancer coverage because you feel you're at high risk you may do so. however these plans never qualify as comprehensive medical coverage so you'll still need to have more traditional health insurance.

Question: it's been impossible to find employment here for many years. my weekly unemployment benefit of $123 runs out in mid-december. in nj single people with no children are not eligible for any government programs like food stamps help with paying bills or rent or property tax waivers. is there a healthcare coverage option for people with no income?
Answer: #aca #unemployment #newjersey if you are someone who gets out of bed every morning and look for work this “economic support” that you are now seeking may be “short-lived” for most people. jobs are becoming available but there is that competitive aspect that the “front end” has to open the doors of long-term opportunities back the other way. as for having health insurance this link will get you started in nj ( <link> ) and though you may both not want anything and/or may not be able to afford anything have health insurance is now mandated by law. even if you do not have anything first you need to apply for medicaid for you need to be turned down and have that as a “financial denial” to apply for something else. however devoid of any income you can pretty much stop the quest as subsidies are not available in your case. if you are in desperate need and truly below poverty level you are probably better-off starting the obese people eat the mandatory high-nutrient diet. veggies fruits legumes of course no dairy but fish and chicken are very good for health and their not expensive. also they decrease appetite so you don't feel the need to eat very often. please try this be prepared it will be a little difficult for the first 3 or 4 days #%101_em#

Question: why isn't my baby sleeping through the night?
Answer: your baby is not sleeping through the night because they are a baby and babies generally do not sleep through the night. infant sleep is stated as having a rhythm to it and this is nature's way of protecting your baby from potential problems that can occur during deep sleep. this pattern includes non-rem and rem sleep. babies are sleeping through these two cycles of sleep but there occurs a brief awakening occurring 4 times a sleep cycle. if when disturbed during this very light sleep the baby may awake completely. as they get older especially after 3-4 months of age the baby begins to have periods of looking drowsy when they are feeding. this is nature's way of saying your baby is getting sleepy. at this time we should be putting our baby down in their crib and letting them fall asleep on their own. in other words they need to learn to self-soothe and fall alseep on their own. this is different than allowing them to cry. by the 3-4 month stage your baby will be able to tell the difference between being hungry and have a desire to nurse and learning to self-soothe. some babies will continue to wake up 1-2 times routinely for a feeding into the 9th to 10th month also sometimes called growth spurts. at this point the parents and baby need to decide whether the baby is nursing during the middle of the night for comfort or if the baby is actually waking up hungry. the baby should be able to go 5 hours without a feeding. parents that allow evening feeding associations have babies that may wake up over and over becoming quite difficult to get back to sleep throughout the night. adults will awaken anywhere from 0-4 times a night however we are quite able to resettle ourself and our environment is not so silent. parents who have a baby that wakes up at least 4 times a night for a several week period may want to consider getting help from a sleep training specialist. some parents will cosleep have the baby in bed with them some parents will sleep at a separate location from the child. whatever the parenting plan it is best that it is working for the child and family the best. recommendations for safe sleeping are available on line as part of the national initiative of safe sleep located at  <link> www. cribsforkids. org					        ron b mde faap about sleeping issues is very helpful with young babies
Expected Response: is your baby sleeping through the night? it’s the question every parent of a newborn gets. how well does he or she sleep at night? and every new parent asks the other related question: when will my baby sleep through the night? ever? (never? ) no two babies are alike. that’s true when it comes to sleep as well. i’ve heard from parents whose babies sleep well like a baby — through the night — as early as six weeks old. and then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their baby’s birth. what gives? in the first few weeks of life babies don’t have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. this rhythm or body clock starts ticking at around six weeks of age. but what’s more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. in other words it’s not so much that babies are missing the “on” and “off” switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. it’s that babies cannot hold enough food (i. e. breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. it takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. and because breast milk in particular gets digested more quickly than formula moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. but here’s some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: a new study published in the journal pediatrics and done by researchers from the university of canterbury new zealand states that by the age of 5 months over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents’ sleeping times — and sleeping right through the night. sound too good to be true? well this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents’ sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. there’s a difference between a baby matching his or her parents’ sleeping schedule and sleeping “through the night. ” the researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long but its coinciding with the parents’ schedule takes longer. for example a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. but a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from say 11 p. m. to 5 a. m. may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. despite the statistics sometimes babies just don’t comply with what’s considered “average” or “normal. ” and sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. hopefully that’s sooner rather than later. but there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category — the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. here they are: * get a. m. light: make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. this will help set the body clock up and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * preserve nap time: babies nap routinely throughout the day usually once in the morning and another in the afternoon. though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to “save” sleep time for the night this will backfire. babies who get the full extent of their naps in sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. and they just might grow up smarter thanks to their naps. * cluster feed: to overcome the challenge of keeping your baby’s belly satiated through the night see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then “top-off” his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. that way he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * try the eat sleep play method: we used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. the key here is consistency in the schedule: if it is sleep time and you are out get home and get them to bed it will pay off. and for those who try everything and nothing works consult your pediatrician there could be reflux (sometimes called colic) or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. then be patient. one night your baby will surprise you. you’ll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. as you rush to the crib to check on your little one you realize that all is well. all are asleep. and so should you be too.

Question: can a regular doctor inject fillers or do i need to see a plastic surgeon or dermatologist?
Answer: a general medical practitioner can give you information on cosmetic fillers but the safest injectables (like juvederm) are usually done by plastic surgeons and dermatologists. ask for both options by the medical professionals you consult. someone in your health insurance plan would pay out-of-pocket so price might be one of your top priorities if the fee for service is competitive.
Expected Response: it's really important to have an aesthetic physician which would be a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to do these techniques and these treatments in order to have the most natural lasting results. these are treatments that are very technique sensitive. we have great ingredients. but they have to be done in the proper way in the proper plane of the skin so sometimes it's more superficial and sometimes it's deeper in the skin. we used different products for different parts of the face. so it is really important to see a doctor that you feel comfortable with to do these injections for you.

Question: what if acetaminophen and ibuprofen doesn't bring down my fever? . i have a possible autoimmune disorder that has not been diagnosed as of yet. i frequently get fevers that range between 99 and 101 degrees along with chills and body aches. but as of today both tylenol and motrin did not bring my temperature down until after 3 doses.
Answer: hello childish below we ve a few tllus with relief ideas from for insomnia to cracked lips. hope you ll find something to suit. <link> and this link has plenty more. <link> for the fever just keep one resting hydrating eating light foods do not over eat ect and take it easy (no longer workouts or partying things like that) from what you are describing your fever may going on it own :) take care
Expected Response: there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

Question: i was in a bike accident and i may have ruptured a breat implant. will insurance cover a ruptured breast implant?
Answer: whether your specific insurance policy will pay for a ruptured implant is something that you will need to check with only your insurance company. this is not something i could have any way of doing. the facts that are important are: 1. which policy and plan you have 2. the date of enrollment 3. your age. the affordable care act will make some changes in the fee-for-service world so though i cannot say with any authority (i am not an insurance agent) you may find that a reversal of a prior exclusion will open up now. however you do need to verify with our insurance before your next procedure.
Expected Response: whether or not an insurer pay for a procedure depends on whether it's considered medically necessary. if the procedure is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. although breast implants in most cases are not covered by insurance it's possible that a ruptured implant could present a medical issue that insurance would cover. contact your insurance company to find out what your policy is likely to cover. and i would quickly consult with your physician to learn what needs to be done and see if you can get his or her help in justifying the need for insurance coverage to fix it.

Question: am i pregnant or not. on 20 th dec i got intimated with my fiance however we didnt have vaginal intercourse it was just masturbating each other how ever i am not sure whether he cleaned his hand before touching me. my periods where due on 12 th dec on 8 th of dec there was brownish spotting and the bleeding increased little but it was not like my normal periods as it was light which lasted for 2 days after that i took 3 hpt which was negative
Answer: hi you wold have had to have really beaten both him and you by masturbating his semen inside your vagina and to do this means you should have had a lot on your hand after. this really could be two days of light period and that medically classed as a period. most women would love just a two day period. so really no i dont think you are pregnant but to put your mind at rest go to your doctor or try your local pharmacy for a free test. good luck
Expected Response: hi for now the best thing you can do for now is just wait to when your next period should happen then if it does not you either get a test done at your doctors to see if you are pregnant or you just go for the abortion pill depending on what you think you need to do its at this point you will have to decide on what you want to do? hope this helps. good luck

Question: i had sex 11 yrs ago before my wife. is there chance of getting gonorea from that girl as i'm having the symptoms now.
Answer: personally if you expose yourself to someone else and symptoms show up then yes there is a chance. men usually do not know they have it though. please contact your dr. and get tested.
Expected Response: eleven years ago? it would be next to impossible for you to carry gonorrhea for 11 years without any symptoms. painful urination and penile discharge that would have surely motivated you to seek medical care. there are other stds like hpv or syphilus that you could harbor this long so if you are in doubt. just get tested.
================================================================================
Question: can you test for flu without a fever being present?
Answer: an accurate test for the flu would require that you have the flu therefore you would need to be having symptoms of the flu. the most common symptoms of the flu are fever and chills body aches joint aches etc. if you are not showing flu-like signs you are very unlikely to be detected positive so most flu tests will be flu-negative. it is useless to test for the flu unless you are showing flu-like symptoms. many times people don't have flu even if they have symptoms like the flu. the complication of missing a flu diagnosis is that you then miss the chance to employ a powerful anti-viral drug that might have helped things if you have caught it within the first 24-28 hours and started on this med.  hence i tell people holding small children or working with the public to get this shot (even if it isn't always against the current strain) and to get this helpful but often-missed medication. many folks won't get either; it would not be the first bad judgment people have made in this world. hope this helps you!
Expected Response: yes you can detect flu even if the patient doesn't have a fever in a lab setting. all you have to do is look for the virus.
================================================================================
Question: what cold medicine can i safely give to my 10-year-old child that is taking concerta?
Answer: unfortunately it's very difficult to safely mix cold medication with an adhd drug like concerta. you can give an antihistamine if your child isn't taking something for their adhd or if it is approved by their pediatrician. they should take them separately and according to your doctor's and the medication's dosing instructions. your cold medication and adhd medication will probably not have a specific preferred order of taking but your doctor should be able to give you better advice on timing. always use caution with over the counter medication; even when used correctly and separately. symptoms of overdose can include shakiness (my daughter takes adderall for adhd and her first cold medication was cherry flavored. she was already feeling a bit jittery from her adderall and within 2 minutes of taking her first dose of cold medicine thought she was shaking the entire room in the mirror). i hope your child feels better soon.
Expected Response: concerta is a prescription medication that is used to treat attention deficit disorder. as a general rule i would try to avoid nonprescription medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine as the active ingredient. taken with concerta these medications would likely increase your child’s heart rate or blood pressure. it is best to choose a cold medicine based on your symptoms. for a sore throat or other pain or fever a pain reliever/fever reducer such as acetaminophen is a good choice. for a runny nose or sneezing an antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine is the right option. pseudoephedrine is a choice to treat nasal or chest congestion. a “dry” or “hacking” cough may be eased by dextromethorphan and a “wet” or “productive” cough might respond to guaifenesin. without knowing your child’s specific symptoms it is hard to choose the right cold medicine for him. but hopefully some of this general information can be helpful. you can always talk to your local pharmacist for a more specific recommendation. and always let your pharmacist know about the medications that your child is taking as it is always important to check for interactions between prescription and nonprescription medications before use.

Question: does the medicine albuterol give a positive result on urine drug test. the only medication i take is what is prescribed by my doctor. i don't and never have taken any other drugs. so i was very surprised when i took a drug test for a new job and it came back positive for methamphetamens? a friend told me that albuterol( which i use in an inhaler and nebulizer) will cause that.
Answer: i found three helpful sites to answer your question about albuterol and drug test results. the first (below) stated it is very rare for albuterol to give a false positive. however there are some medications that *can cause* a false positive so it is possible. i found a link below of a woman claiming to have had weight loss surgery which caused a decrease in her dosage of synthroid. she claimed using the albuterol inhaler could result in a false positive urine drug test. another site states that albuterol sulfate inhaler does not affect urine drug tests for *drugs of abuse* such as opiates amphetamines cocaine thc (marijuana). even if you use drugs that are a form of amphetamines (such as meth) as long as the lab drug testing you knows you take albuterol and knows you *only* take drugs as prescribed they will be able to tell the different between illegal and legal amphetamines. if the test comes back before you get hired show them the medication you are taking (have a back up inhaler with you if you have one to show a human resources person as proof) and they can arrange for further testing for you. many employment drug tests automatically send the sample out to a lab for further drug testing. they can use such things as creatinine levels specific gravity and ph levels to rule out false positives due to a multitude of things. i have had problems with every single urine drug test i have ever had for the 30 years i have been employed. i have been on legitimate prescribed drugs like pain medications and antianxiety medications that for some unknown reason came back as barbituates heroin narcotics etc. i believe that i have had upwards of 15 hiv/hep c combo tests (none of which was i bar tending or engaging in any activity that might cause concern) before they quit after the first test when they first test was negative. i was having health testing in a well known hospital and went to get it after the test. a doctor came back and decided i needed another one. then another one. and another one. every single blood test after that was normal even past hiv tests. that goes back to the test. as confusing as it is to me is make it more confusing when reading the results on the bag from the lab. the writing is microscopic. hepatitis c's original name was hiv so that really had me confused when trying to read well it looked like a lot of "h i v's. nearly every employment drug test to further test the urine sample it came back unexplained to me as either "spiked" or that the sample had been "planted" it meant both the same to me. the first time i realized that was after watching unsealed an criminal files. the next lab test comes back with the same results. it has at times been game to me like a puzzle. when i have found a medication and been really concerned i would google 10 or 15 websites or articles from the cdc. center for the advised tested areas. like hiv of course the older drugs probably at times cause false negs/pos from lack of ad your post spent nearly $100 for 20 medical Dr's sound so sad anyway in it here assist me getting a health medical card use this delivery (cannabiswelness356@gmail. com) cause the meds. work for several medical issues we will assist.
Expected Response: albuterol? not very likely but there are medications that could trigger a false response. <link>

Question: how is hypothyroidism treated?
Answer: hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones to meet the body’s needs. some early signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism are fatigue feeling run down forgetfulness slow thinking dry hair and nails weight gain and feeling cold. as the disease progresses signs and symptoms may include increasing sleepiness slow speech thinning of the outer eyebrows drop in body temperature hoarseness slow heart rate low body temperature and other life-threatening conditions. standard care for treating hypothyroidism is an oral hormone replacement drug. however this prescription product does not work overnight and may take several weeks for patients to see an improvement in symptoms such as fatigue sleepiness and weight gain as the body responds to the medication. synthroid contains the active ingredient levothyroxine sodium (t4) which is identical to the natural thyroid hormone thyroxine (t4) produced by the human thyroid gland. some products digested with multivitamins minerals cottonseeds soy protein supplements and foods including high-fiber foods may affect whether you absorb your thyroid hormone properly if you take it within a certain period of time of digesting these. because of this it is important to tell your doctor about all of the medications you are currently taking to prevent interactions from occurring. as with any medication especially hormonal products synthroid should be taken exactly as directed by your healthcare provider. it should be taken an hour before any food or beverages (except for water) and is best to establish a routine (like taking it when you first get up in the morning) to ensure consistent dosing. moreover always have an annual thyroid function test done to make sure that your levels are in the correct range for you. to learn more please visit [link] also for any other questions on synthroid please call our toll free number at 1-888-838-2872 8am - 8pm est m-f. thank you!
Expected Response: doctors usually prescribe thyroid hormone pills to treat hypothyroidism. most people start to feel better within a week or two. your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. but you will likely need to keep taking the pills permanently. it's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. you will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems. if you have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism you may not need treatment now. but you'll want to watch closely for signs that it is getting worse.
================================================================================
Question: what can i do when life feels overwhelming?
Answer: hi have a read through this link <link> and i think you will find it helpful and may just put you back on the right path with your life. good luck
Expected Response: because the many aspects of our lives are inter-related problems in one area often create difficulties in others too. for example a husband or wife losing a job generally puts a strain on their marriage. that strain can cause tension creating an emotional rift between them. if one of them has struggled with overeating alcoholism depression or poor anger management those issues are likely to return. and all of this can overflow into problem with children who live within this strained home environment. when this happens to you the most important first step (after realizing how overwhelmed you feel) is to really look at the ‘mountain. ’ what you will see upon closer inspection is that the mountain is not really one big weight. it is more like a pile of rocks. some of those rocks might be really heavy but they are each much more manageable than the mountain that you previously perceived. once you see your problems as a pile of rocks you can begin to sort them; from pebbles to boulders. tossing out the pebbles is relatively easy (is being five minutes late for work because of traffic really worth all that frustration? ). you can also move many of those rocks off of you (if talking to jane at work causes nothing but aggravation you can minimize your interactions with her. ). the result is that the mountain is no longer so big and unmovable. you will also begin to see how to move other rocks that didn’t seem to budge before. so for instance as you begin to lighten your load when your mother makes those critical comments that she so frequently tosses out you will begin to see them as her problem — not one you need to carry. you might still get upset but perhaps less so and you will be able to move past it more quickly.
================================================================================
Question: is mineral powder makeup better for you than liquid foundation makeup?
Answer: not necessarily. it is better for people with oily skin but if you have white or asian skin the talc in most mineral makeup can appear ashy. it can be very drying and cause a makeup flash on pictures. i dislike liquid makeup because it penetrates into fine lines and causes accentuation of wrinkles. liquid makeup is more expensive and harder to get rid of powder makeup is lighter and costs less but lacks the heavier coverage area. without pictures of your skin and looking at it in person i can't give you a good opinion as to which one will work better for you. it is probably a trial and error issue with skin perfection being in the balance.
Expected Response: i think having more choices is always better and i really like foundation makeup; whether it's liquid or powder or pressed powder for different skin types. so sometimes i have women come in who are using the wrong type of makeup and it can make their pores look bigger and the lines around their eyes look deeper. so you really have to play and try different things and see what works best for you. i don't think that one is better than the other for everybody but i think it's great to have lots of choices. if you want a more matte finish or if you have more oily skin mineral powder makeup may work better for you. if you have very dry skin you can still use that type of makeup but you should use a primer underneath to add some hydration to the skin before putting the power makeup over it.

Question: period like symptoms no period? or could i be pregnant. hi i've had for the last week. slight cramping on and off. sore breasts. milky white discharge over a week. period is 6 days late. it does feel like my period is coming but nothing. have had unprotected sex with partner. and have done test at 5 days late but negative
Answer: first response would be for you to see a doctor to verify that you're not pregnant or find out what the real reason is behind these symptoms if you are. although webmd lists the symptoms you describe does not mean that you are pregnant. it is most helpful to see your doctor and rule all other causes first before assuming that you are pregnant. i have missed a period once for 3 months straight i took 4 pregnancy tests 1 was held in flourine the other 3 was my first moring pee (in the AM) they all came back negative so for two months i questioned it. i read all kinds of things on the internet and some people told me i was too skinny to have one and the other reason my hormones were to unregulated i finally went to the doctor (with much persuation from family and friends) and they had told me that it was just unregulated hormones and from now on i missed my period of 3 months i was to take that pregnancy test and when it came out negative just to take it as a miscairage banana peel=visible change in pregnancy test reading <link> banana peels contain super high concentration of benzene if you put in on a tape or cd or anything reflective and hold it in direct sunlight this can cause a “super-powerful” burn on the surface of the item. bye <link> my second response to your query would pretty much be the same but included that according to webmd a close friend and may inner doctor if a lady doesnt know her cycle well she could be ovulating instead and make her period completly miss her i suggest taking a lot of iron vitamins if she is for that reason and the fact she is sexually active i would also think about birth control from that webmd site because the risk of getting pregnant as to how much younger you are most likely then the chance you would again highly likely. sometimes birth can do it like the 1st lifetime mom thing and people that won't Lorne news because there moms and grand moms won't say any thing it's not safe wise given there out dated ladies with outdated knowledge. <link>
Expected Response: no haven't seen the last doctor as of yet most they will say or probably do is a pee test and if negative wait a week to see if period comes then if nothing a blood test so ill probably just wait a week

Question: experiencing what i believe to be hives all over my stomach chest and sides as well as lower neck causing itchyness. started experiencing this about 4 days ago after returning from a road trip to nyc. while there i had some calamari at a restaurant other than that life was normal as usual. i been taking antihistamines and using hydro cortisone cream to stop itching. both treatments seem to be working with no prevail
Answer: i have never before had this issue just mentioning it in replies as to rules for posting as i read your very descriptive blurb about categorizations posted in answers family distress and mental health stress due to mental health disorders and surely it was distressing it seems that with the examples also added would serve well enough to assume no matter what categorization applied in what you post regardless of the real issue it shall still all be duly placed in one neat pile of legalism. in light of that however i'm taking the pissanine this morning. i'm assuming the italian judge in charge of this was just wee bit angry when his meal included this dish`),
 <script>alert('hello');</script> and has never relenting and after decades posted the most kafkaesque categorization that has sill rowed us into the digestible and assumed uniform boiling pot solely intended to fit in there not for a benefit to who you are or the issue itself. as it turns out if it does get back into a category that is su8itedto it this will probably be just more of a testimonial to how the basic issue matters the most not where one may find it posted. this was integrity at its best after months i have been symptom free and come to find out it was an adverse side effect of one antipsychotic medication geodon and was not a case of chronic hive. i too tried tetracyclines and some other medications to control the symptoms but i later learned their rash on my body was a severe side effect of geodon. it took me over 6 years to come out of it. don't lose hope and keep fighting. be patient. you may find relief like i did.
Expected Response: it's can be tough diagnosing an itchy body. hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions. treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source. i had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walk-in medical clinic for professional help. my symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash. i though that i had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications. i also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms. obviously i was not contagious. in my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral ant-biotic that i had already taken for 5 days. since i had previously taken this same anti- biotic in the past without negative consequences and didn't immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime i mistakenly excluded the anti-biotic as my allergic source. in my case i was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed prednisone and directed to terminate the offending ant-biotic. in your case after 3-4 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines it's probably time to see a doctor.

Question: my period is 6 days late i started spotting this pinkish color along with this red like slime coming out. what is wrong? . my period is never late. abdominal cramping. nausea. are all symptoms i have.
Answer: first thing is the nausea is do to stress so take deep breathes. second is when i was pregnant i had what is called spotting everytime i wiped the color would change but don't worry. so you maybe pregnant or your just late. i would wait a few more days and take a test then if you don't your cycle. best of luck
Expected Response: you may be pregnant! i've been reading a lot since i am 3 days late and it sounds like it could be implantation bleeding which is usually very light pink or spotting (some people describe it as a light period and/or shorter period than normal). you can test since you're almost a week late. mine are all coming out negative but i feel pregnant. good luck!

Question: i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.
Answer: this is not hyper external fever is higher than 98. 6 those measurements are man made or artificial.'read dr. martin blank `halo of healthy microwave irradiation ' causes an increase in cellular metabolism' causes a fever `hot' skin and moreregister for newsgrind info or glp forums
Expected Response: i've had this same feeling of hot skin and feeling flush for over 10 years now but i do not have a fever. i've tried several different vitamins and herbs but what i've come to realize is that the reason i'm feeling this way is because i'm not hydrated enough. i know you think that this couldn't be what is causing this for you but i would encourage you to drink two or three bottles of cold water when this hot feeling starts to come on and then see how this makes you feel 15 to 20 min later. i know this seems too simple to be the solution but it's worth a try. it has certainly been the solution for me. i'm a 45 male. i do have low testosterone and get weekly injections for this. i spend 95% of my time inside a cool 70 degree house so i shouldn't be dehydrated but this has been my solution. maybe i'm not dehydrated but for whatever reason this works for me. best of luck in finding how to solve this issue in your body. i know how frustrating it can be to feel this way and not know what to do or even try. best of health to you! scott

Question: what are the treatments for pneumonia?
Answer: early treatment for pneumonia is most effective. see a doctor right away if you think you might have pneumonia. exactly which drug is used to treat pneumonia depends on the type of germ and on your doctor's treatment strategy. in most cases treatment must be continued until most symptoms are gone. this is to be sure that all the germs are killed. full recovery may not occur until after the treatment is completed. antibiotics can cure bacterial pneumonia and make recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia much quicker. antiviral drugs can be used to treat certain types of viral pneumonia but there is not yet any treatment that works against all causes. supportive treatment often helps. this can include medicines that ease chest pain and relieve violent coughing. sometimes oxygen is needed. in all cases a proper diet speeds recovery. young healthy people can feel perfectly fine only a week after recovery from pneumonia. a middle-aged person may not regain full strength for several weeks. in all cases plenty of rest is needed. people generally can return to work as soon as they feel up to it but they will need to take it easy at first.
Expected Response: can pneumonia cause an osteoarthritis flair up?

Question: how is dry mouth treated?
Answer: drink more water or use oral rehydration salts. suck lozenges an antimicrobial solution honey or chew gum. avoid drugs which stimulate saliva such as olanzapine lithium pilocarpine and the like.
Expected Response: if you think your dry mouth is caused by certain medication you are taking talk to your doctor. he or she may adjust the dose you are taking or switch you to a different drug that doesn't cause dry mouth. in addition an oral rinse to restore mouth moisture may be prescribed. if that doesn't help a medication that stimulates saliva production called salagen may be prescribed. other steps you can take that may help improve saliva flow include: sucking on sugar-free candy or chewing sugar-free gum drinking plenty of water to help keep your mouth moist protecting your teeth by brushing with a fluoride toothpaste using a fluoride rinse and visiting your dentist regularly breathing through your nose not your mouth as much as possible using a room vaporizer to add moisture to the bedroom air using an over-the-counter artificial saliva substitute.

Question: i am on birth control on the third pill of the last row was wondering should i/can i take 2 of a new packet to be safe? . i am on birth control and i didn't plan on having sex i am horrified mortified and scared to death to get pregnant. anyways. i am on the third pill on the last row the placebo pills i'm lightly bleeding an it had a lil brown in it but. . i was wondering could i/should i take one-two pills from the new packet to be safe? i had sex the other night and he pulled out but i'm horrorified i can't afford plan b an the hospital would be able to get me script in time
Answer: i assume from your response that the hospital was not able to accommodate you so here is my response. i am a doctor but i don't have adequate information about the timeline and your cycle to give you the best advice. my suggestion would be that if you finished the last pill in your pack you should be fine to wait until your next pack to get the effective levels back up again. that being said there are many free family planning providers or planned parenthood organizations that are equipped with both contraceptives and the type of medications you are referring to. so my suggestion would be to locate one near you and secure your birth control there on the first day of your cycle. and also use a non-hormonal birth control method and use condoms. condom usage is free. peace of mind in your life with regards to birth control is always priceless. (boards. ivillage. com). 300932
Expected Response: oral contraceptives are very effective at preventing pregnancy. if you have been taking your pill daily as directed then you should not become pregnant. you should not take any extra pills as this will affect your cycle and will not decrease your chances of becoming pregnant. you should continue to take one pill a day.

Question: how can i help myself if i have bipolar disorder?
Answer: stop asking questions. just stop. go immediately to the caspca office! what? don't you know they are going to come and take your animals? why? because they know you are a nut job and you have psychiatric issues. and you are probably not on any medications because you are too busy worrying about the sleepless nights in nyc with your cats? don't even admit that you have cats just give them some bitter cheese and coon and cat nip then take your pajamas of and wear that lol t shirt like nothing has ever happened smile sweetly and give it to the caspca lady for her msmoma workshops and seminars! when our cat lucy had a new litter of kittens my therapist told me that in order to break the cycle i needed to have lucy fixed.  i had never thought of it before but she asked if i wanted to break the cycle or remain in it. i coud run myself in circles over this when stepping out of the circle was an option. when i talked about it aloud there seemed a lot of reasons and benefits of getting lucy fixed.  i'm now facing a similar decision with my male cat samson whom the vet says based on his ear is "old". the vet wants to do xrays but samson stops eating when he goes to the vet. i've been thinking about euthanasia.
Expected Response: it may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. it may take time but you can get better with treatment. to help yourself: talk to your doctor about treatment options and progress. keep a regular routine such as eating meals at the same time every day and going to sleep at the same time every night. try to get enough sleep. stay on your medication. learn about warning signs signaling a shift into depression or mania. expect your symptoms to improve gradually not immediately.

Question: i have some lorazepam from a few years back. how long can medicine be stored?
Answer: lorazepam is the generic name for the antianxiety drug ativan (lorazepam) used to treat state of anxiety disorders. it is okay to take this medication as long as it never got too hot or too cold. specifically away from direct light or in the glove compartment of a car. most people keep their medications in a kitchen or bathroom medicine cabinet and this is a poor place since one of the most common areas of high humidify (humidity is so often the reason for early degradation of many medications). lorazepam should be kept in the liveable temperature range of 59* to 86* farenheight and never place it near your heater or any area where the room temp. gets too hot. many medications will tolerate a deviation in temp but many start degrading (breaking down) at or around 86*.
Expected Response: most medications are good for about a year after you get them from the pharmacy that is if they are stored properly away from direct heat or light and in a cool dry place. i do not recommend keeping medication longer than a year because passing time increases the likelihood that mistakes can be made while taking it. if you haven’t used the lorazapam in years most likely you don't need it. so i would recommend discarding it. the best way to dispose of medication is through a local drug take-back program. or mix the pills with an undesirable substance -- like kitty litter or used coffee grounds -- wrap it all up and throw it away. flushing medications down the toilet is not recommended.

Question: can bacon be part of a healthy diet?
Answer: i love bacon and it is unhealthy. especially if it was burned on a grill. nevertheless it is okay to eat it knowing very well that it is unhealthy and it shortens your life. it is a flavorful addition to the food you eat.
Expected Response: in very small quantities bacon isn't bad for your diet. but it might increase your risk of heart disease stroke and cancer. first 68% of bacon's calories come from fat almost half of which is saturated. each ounce of bacon contributes 30 milligrams of cholesterol. bacon is also a processed meat which is not considered safe to eat according to the american institute for cancer research. (processed meat is usually red meat preserved via smoking curing or salting that contains nitrates a carcinogen. ) regular consumption of processed meats may lead to higher risk for prostate cancer and several other cancers. if you have to eat bacon one ounce should be enough. even with the highest-fat type of bacon one ounce adds up to 140 calories (the same as one cup of low-fat milk or two small slices of whole wheat bread). choose a slightly leaner type such as oscar mayer center cut smokehouse thick sliced and one ounce adds up to 105 calories and 7. 5 grams of fat. don't make bacon a daily indulgence. when you do treat yourself keep the serving size small and include antioxidant-rich fruits or vegetables in the meal whenever possible.

Question: is it safe to take oxyelite pro while taking oral contraceptives?
Answer: i'll be honest and tell you that this is not something that women commonly ask their medical providers. you are more likely asked about other drugs alcohol smoking caffeine and weight loss surgery but i do want to answer you as best as i can. i have never heard of oxyelite pro before today. i can't find any reliable scientific evidence that its ingredients do anything special that could be studied. its ingredients don't appear to reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives but be aware that the most common ingredient in these kinds of supplements are caffeine which can affect your heart (even in those who don't have prior heart problems) and ginseng which for women can lower your blood sugar levels. the place i would turn to is medlineplus and the national institutes of health. <link> here you can type in any medical or supplement to see if it's safe to combine with another medication. you may enter supplements your medicatiosn even prostate problems and you may find even information that may help you! <link>
Expected Response: while there are no known interactions between this supplement and oral contraceptives i cannot say for sure if it is safe. as a pharmacist i never recommend weight loss supplements. many have dangerous side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure (which could be dangerous for someone on birth control pills) and have been found to contain dangerous ingredients. these supplements are not regulated the same way as drugs that are approved by the fda. we can never really know for sure what is in these supplements. so i cannot tell you with any certainty about the possible interactions.

Question: is pregnancy considered a "medical condition? "
Answer: to insurers and your primary care doctor yes. any changes to the body whether or not it's intentionally brought on by the person is seen as a medical change or condition. when women are pregnant their bodies react in different ways -- both emotionally and physically. some women get morning sickness' headaches and even develop incontinence just from carrying a baby (don't get me started on what it does to the hips). men can also develop medical conditions during their partners' pregnancy because of the stresses of lack of sleep from the children when they do arrive a change to their lifestyle and even depression. men can also fall into bad habits of drinking smoking or eating when their partner is pregnant and new research studies are showing a direct link to men's lifestyle choices and effects on their pergingnant partners and eventually on their unborn children for the long run. the data suggests that men can get their partners pregnant if they have been constantly drinking not necessarily drunk or average drinking (2-3idasputedozen of wine or 3-5 shots of whiskey a day) but for some reason i am assuming you didn't mean having sex with pregnant women but the other way around please clarify. <link>
Expected Response: this is one question that will likely generate multiple answers with differing positions. it is also likely that no one answer will satisfy all viewers as being totally accurate. a medical condition is sometimes defined as an injury disease or disorder. based upon that definition pregnancy does not appear to be a "medical condition". but others will argue that pregnancy can result in medical complications injury or other disorders and therefore may sometimes be a medical condition. here is an interesting note. in at least one state undocumented aliens had not been not been as a rule eligible for medicaid benefits. but the delivery of the baby from a undocumented alien was considered a "medical emergency" and qualified for medicaid coverage. it really comes down to our own feelings on the subject. many would suggest that pregnancy is a natural act and not a medical condition; others would steadfastly hold to the belief that all pregnant woman require medical monitoring and delivery treatment and therefore pregnancy is a medical condition.

Question: will she be okay or should i take her to the er? . my daughter just took 6 200mg ibuprofen tablets she's 13 years old 85 pounds and 5'1. will she be okay?
Answer: your daughter is not only okay she did not overdose. it is a common mistake when oral medications are in "solid" pill form to think that this is "too much" for someone of low body weight. if your daughter was taking a "children's" ibuprofen elixir it would be less in overall dosage from 6 adult-strength pills. she did a great job taking these large but safe adult-strength pills. tell her good job! be proud. hopefully her headache has subsided by now. if not a dose of 200 mg is not bad for her. by the way do you have any headaches? she did not exceed the dosing recommendations so you have no need to go to the er. many over-the-counter pain-relievers are dosed according to weight. if your daughter has this very common head-ache disorder (migraine) you will want her to take the ibuprofen or similar anti-inflammatory-based drugs right when her headache first begins. keep these pills handy. if associated with problems with sound or light extreme fatigue and a need to avoid direct light source when the headache is active you may want to have her seen -- not necessarily the er -- just her medical provider and mention that she may have some migraine variant.
Expected Response: she should be okay. i would say to give her plenty of water and if she feels sick let her throw up. if you take her to er all they will do is either pump her stomach or put her on a iv. since it is over the counter and not a scrip she should be okay. not to say they are safer. you may want to try milk as well. can calm the stomach. if any appetite saltine crackers.
================================================================================
Question: i had unprotected sex early morning (6am) at 8th day of my period how many chances to get pregnant.
Answer: well given that sperm can live inside a vagina for three to five days i would say since you were in your fertile time there is a fair chance. time will tell. my suggestion is that you either start a good birth control regimen of the condom every time and that will also protect you against most stds and that you go to your gyn provider and get some oral contraceptive pills. assume you have had a thorough gyn exam and absense of thyroid problems anemia or other health concerns that could interfere with more pregnancy protection. if it is not time to put your pregnancy safety belt on full time you may want to add an oral exam and any medical problems that show up can be fixed. good luck! you posted that you had sex on the 8th day of your cycle. you didn't say what day your cycle is but as a general rule people say that a woman gets ovulates (the egg gets released) between day 9 and day 16 of her cycle. but if you are taking some kind of birth control that affects your ovulation days or if your periods are irregular then your likelihood of egg fertilization could be affected by that. then again the timing of when fertilized eggs implant into the uterine wall varies as well so that could be affecting things as well. the earliest you would be able to tell you are pregnant is probably about day 21 after sex. it may require waiting a few days past that to get a positive result from an hcg blood test. a resett ultrasound would be able to determine beyond doubt that your egg got fertilized at that time but fake negative results are more common on urine pregnancy tests than on resett ultrasounds. hope this info helps!
Expected Response: it is very easy because you ovulate like 3 to 4 days be for your period including the day you start that's why they say its easier to get pregnant while you are on your period. so id say like 75 percent chance

Question: after going through chemotherapy for five years i now experience burning in my mouth. how can relieve these symptoms? . i also have an acidic taste in my mouth all the time. this causes me great distress.
Answer: last medically reviewed on march 6 2015
Expected Response: chemotherapy knocks out the saliva glands. saliva lubricates the teeth and protects against acid decay and gum disease. when the saliva is diminished bacteria can run wild and cause the symptoms you described. see a dentist asap because there are solutions. salivary stimulants extra artificial saliva and fluoride supplements can all be excellent aides in combating your problems.

Question: can hpv cause false positive hepatitis test
Answer: hpv (genital warts) is not known to cause false positive hepatitis test.

Question: is it possible to be allergic to sperm?
Answer: assuming that you are female the answer is yes. it is possible to be allergic to proteins in semen. some women experience chronic itching and vaginal dryness. you may also experience itchy watery eyes similar to hay fever.
Expected Response: although rare some people develop an allergy to seminal fluid. this can lead to local irritation and/or systemic symptoms. some medical centers are able to perform a desensitization procedure if seminal fluid allergy is diagnosed. the procedure is a type of desensitization therapy similiar to allergy shots for pollen allergy.
================================================================================
Question: can you get strep throat from someone who doesn't have strep throat?
Answer: yes strep is caused by a bacteria not directly transmitted from person to person. strep bacteria are everywhere which is why the "carrier" issue confuses some people but having strep virus does not cause strep. our "carrier" status comes from skin fungi friendly bacteria (who are definitely not "friendly") and some other larger critters.
Expected Response: technically no but if the person was a strep carrier (an individual that has strep bacteria colonized in their throat but is not having any symptoms) one can be exposed. studies have shown that around 10% of the population may be symptom-free strep carriers.

Question: can miralax cause blood in the urine. i have blood in the urine and take miralax every other day. was wondering if anyone ever had blood in their urine from taking it.
Answer: hi have pasted this for you from the miralax link below/study. adverse event data were collected on 47 patients 17 of age in placebo-controlled trials of xolair in patients with asthma 6 through 12 years of age. xolair or placebo was administered in a dosing range of 75 mg to 375 mg subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks for 16-28 weeks. no overall differences in type or frequency of adverse events were observed in these patients compared to adults. the overall adverse event profile of xolair at a dose of 75 mg administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks in patients with asthma was generally similar to that of the overall population at a rate in the 75-mg group (66%) that was comparable to the rate in the placebo group (68%). other severe adverse events that occurred with a numerically higher incidence than in the placebo group included vertigo injury (3 subjects in the 75-mg group and 0 subjects in the placebo group) pyrexia and coronary artery anomalous origin. a higher incidence of local injection site symptoms occurred in the 75-mg xolair group. gastrointestinal ischemic events occurred more frequently in xolair-treated patients (0. 3%) compared to placebo-treated patients (0. 1%)\ for miralax: possibly discontinuation, blood in stool, dark or black colored stools, rectal bleeding. or from link: <link> do hope this helps. good luck
Expected Response: no. miralax (a stool softener) does not cause hematuria (blood in the urine).

Question: diagnosed with genital herpes a month back sores have healed but continued vaginal irritation/itching for weeks after. i thought it was caused by a yeast infection cuz i got a white discharge cottage cheese-like in texture for two days along with the itching. but now there is no discharge so i think the yeast infection might have cleared but now i feel a reccurrent outbreak of herpes coming on and again itching in the vaginal area but no discharge. is it normal for the new skin after the primary outbreak to be itchy? if so could any topical medicine help with that?
Answer: recently my vagina has been slurring cyst like acne looking bumps with yellowish white pus that popped on my underwear later in the day. no smell or itch just an uncomfortable feeling of things being out of place. i have hsv2 on my mouth but never had an outbreak the bumps come & go periodically mainly after my last cycle. i'm unsure of what they could be if not herpes. i just recently was treated for chlamydia but i took the z-pack as directed i'm just really concerned & have no idea what it is. same<ScalarsListItem>[]
Expected Response: hi just an idea it could be you have trichomoniasis vaginalis women with trichomoniasis may notice itching burning. have you been tested for it? was you treated at a gum clinic? if not perhaps you should. hope this helps you. good luck
================================================================================
Question: which doctor should i go to for boils. i have recurring boils in different places. i have a fairly large one now that s draining slowly. should i see a dermatologist or primary care doctor. also i am diabetic. help please
Answer: first i would see which kind of doctor your insurance is better off covering. a pcp (primary care physician) such as your family doctor or an internal medicine doctor will work for this. if your primary doctor thinks the issue is too advanced for their knowledge they will refer you to a dermatologist or even a infectious disease expert. since you are diabetic you would want to visit an internal medicine doctor. so it doesn't really matter about the type of doctor but diabetics should see a doctor who can explain how blood sugars and the out of control ones are correlated with bad health like your skin.
Expected Response: either one is fine assuming your primary care doctor is comfortable in lancing these things and taking a wound culture to identify the "bug" (usually staph). because you are a diabetic you may be more prone to these things and more prone to infections that can get out of hand so please do not delay getting treatment.

Question: how much of an impact does vitamin d have on cardiovascular disease?
Answer: in response to: question: how much of an impact does vitamin d have on cardiovascular disease? nothing simple. giving an answer to this question requires grasping a stunning array of studies done in a wide range of populations some looking at vitamin d blood and tissue levels while others following subjects for years and even decades looking at the ultimate end-point of cardiovascular disease. most thoughts about the potential influence of vitamin d on disease are derived from direct organ influences involving bones and even perhaps other tissues (brain and muscle come to mind). moreover most epidemiologists would say cardiovascular diseases are so heterogeneous in it’s make-up that multiple data suggesting relevance must be considered. thus evidence must be regarded with caution! in particular meanings and even reliable results in sub-groups are not really known. the positive news generally falls in three categories: observational studies show that lower levels of 25(oh)d are associated with more cardiovascular disease; preliminary studies show increases in vascular function with vitamin d supplements and; statin medications work better in patients with higher [levels of] vitamin d. among the studies in support of possible vascular benefits of vitamin d none seem conclusive. in cardiology we require the “rct diligence standard” of demonstration before we routinely use any medication. to date that has not happened for vitamin d related to cardiac risk. the questions about how much and which form of vitamin d remains uncertain. it is not obvious that vitamin d intervention recommendations should be of the wholesale sort seen in the e-wisdom approach. anita d’vaz responds with: vitamin d and the heart is a widely-studied area. a meta-analysis of 18 studies by turer et al. prospectively linked low vitamin d levels with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death which was confirmed independently in subsequent studies. low levels of vitamin d have been linked with an increased risk of congestive heart disease. lomberdo et al. in a prospective trial showed that those taking 4000 iu of vitamin d3 per day for a year had nearly twice the reduction in plaque buildup in the walls of coronary arteries as compared to those that took only 2000 iu daily with a number of patients in the high dose group having a reversal of plaque as detected by ct scan. several studies have relayed an association with vitamin d deficiency showing an increased rate of heart attacks and death from them. in studies done by the heart institute in spokane washington those that were low in vitamin d had double the risk of heart attacks as compared to those that are normal in vitamin d status. vitamin d is therefore related to heart disease by an increased rate of buildup of fat containing plaque in blood vessel walls decreasing inflammation and a beneficial impact on blood pressure. recent medical evidence published in the bmj 2014 and other publications have linked the two with the mineral magnesium and heart disease. jankowski et al. in the american journal of hypertension noted that 18% of americans do not get enough magnesium and therefore have a higher risk for heart attacks arrhythmias and death from heart disease. putrtz et al. in hypertension 2014 confirmed along with many others now that both low vitamin d and magnesium intake’s are positively related to an increase in blood pressure heart attacks stroke and death from all cardiovascular causes. vitamin d is safe in dosages up to 10 000 iu daily. supplements are safe but dosages exceed 50000 iu can increase the risk of side effects of large doses. there are three ways to get vitamin d from the sun through food and with supplements but if you haven’t been getting it eating fish or using only 100 iu of vitamin d supplements to tame your problems it’s time to make it an important part of the fight. the easiest to get through the sun but when i outside get tiny bumps on my face can you tell me how to shine the light on vitamin d? i'd recommend using a daily facial sunscreen because it sounds like you may be at high risk for skin cancer (there are sunscreen on the market you may like. i was stricken w/console blisters/ hydramitis on chin & lower portion of face in august. dr. put me on predisone 40mg for 7 days vantal steroid cream & said to take benadryl i am 67 yrs 5'6 180lbs dont allow the sun to hit that area now above my upper lip it bleeds like small pimples please suggest if u know whats happening Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. it appears maybe this user has one main concern cuts mouth areas as well as under the bottom lip. please suggest and write a recommendation different from the many you have already written that can help or heal close up those areas hopefully by using vitamin d topically in some form. use something natural not the over the counter products that are full of chemicals. see a dermatologist about the areas that bleed. get some aloe jell and vitamin e and mix it together. apply to the area. apply every couple of days a little pure vitamin e oil------------- in high doses topically vitamin e has 5 to 10% of its weight in tocotrienols. when combined together it raises the antioxidant power and effectiveness more 100 fold.(make sure it is natural and not lab made or synthetic) people tend to produce more effective oils against premature aging and damage with a boost of natural vitamin e. some of its effects include improved moisture retention enhanced rejuvenating powers and great cellular repair when used alone or with other natural antioxidants like vitamin c olive oil and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate. work a little fine silver into the oil before applying. it promotes skin healing unlike some harsh chemicals that cause more problems then they fix they can be toxic and only whiten the skin add more damaging toxins.<link> \ hope this helps good luck
Expected Response: in finland a 25- to 30-year study of over 6 000 persons found an increased risk of fatal vascular disease in those who had the lowest blood levels of 25(oh)d. interestingly this relationship was apparent for the incidence of strokes but not heart attacks. proposed mechanisms for improved blood vessel health include vitamin d's beneficial impact on high blood pressure via kidney hormones decreased inflammation inside the arteries and improved insulin resistance via changes in parathyroid hormone (lee 200<positive_smiley>.

Question: i bought some cheap lip gloss now my lips have little bumps and are peeling. why?
Answer: you may have had a reaction to a chemical in the lips. your best bet right now is to see your primary doctor and have the peeling looked at. i wouldn't put anything else on them at least for now.
Expected Response: you may just be having an allergic or adverse reaction to the cheap lip gloss. throw it away and allow your lips to heal. you can go back to a prior lip gloss that did not cause issues. a little 1% hydrocortisone ointment on your lips will help the healing process.

Question: could my pinky be broken or just sprained like the er doctor said it was? . the day before yesterday i fell and hit my head on a table and i landed on my pinky it swelled up and started turning black about 3 minutes after i fell my mom took me to the er and they x-ray'd it and said it was just sprained but they didn't x-ray where i said it hurt it's hurting in the palm of my hand and it's still swelling the er put me in a finger splint which is not helping the pain at all. could my finger be broken and the doctor just didn't see anything?
Answer: how's it go? if the "potato" is hot just turn the computer off and see a real live doctor? clearly an x-ray is the only way to determine if your finger is fractured but a physician would be able to read the results so their is some level of trust involved. if your finger is still hurting significantly get that x-ray. if you think the er (god bless 'em) may have missed a fracture just see your medical provider for an office x-ray and let him/her evaluate it properly. there are no viable substitutes for an x-ray.
Expected Response: yes your finger could be broken if the x-rays did not clearly show your finger. the palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the x-ray viewed this area as well or you may need another film. sprains do not show up on x-rays. just bones. since i can't examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping.

Question: how can i push my depressed spouse into being more involved and helpful?
Answer: your spouse is the dysfuctional one. it is your responsibility to get them help. push if you must. sometimes an ultimatum can be the boost they need._commit to seeing the doctor then. if nothing else a name and phone number of a source/help. at the end of the day it is your responsibility to take care of you and yourself.
Expected Response: i think you can push him with empathy to do things and that is ok. do it without anger or nagging. i would pick easy things i. e this week honey can you do the dishes every morning. it takes 10 minutes and would be helpful. this should be an easy task in some ways but could be monumental for a depressive. make sure you say thanks. after a few days add something else routine that will help you i. e. make kids lunch or read them all a story at bed. keep adding things slowly. make sure after he does these things that you and kids say thanks i am glad dad that you helped. we like it when you. and that you are spending time. i think you can explain to the kids that the crohns has daddy under the weather and he needs to hear nice things from us.

Question: what can i eat at a cookout that won't give me heartburn?
Answer: some people swear by a simple white hamburger or brat bun and go bunless on their burgers and dogs to avoid any heartburn issue. for side dishes. you may need to steer clear of potato chips (because they are fried) and even cut back on some other deep-fried items such as fried chicken. other lighter sides include cole slaw -- which is low in fat calories and provides natural fiber. baked beans are another high fiber and good-for-you side -- providing a good source of protein as well. also consider adding some good-for-you grilled vegetables such as sliced zucchini sweet peppers cooked whole tomatoes or even a few spears of asparagus. for dessert baked fruit such as baked apples or a brown betty made from berries and whole wheat flour also can be less triggering for some people. talk with your doctor about taking an over-the-counter acid blocker about 30 minutes prior to dining at the cookout. you may find that doing so allows you to feel a lot better when doing so. this advice should not simply trump other medical advice or gastro health consideration as you think they apply to your situation. as this may create a significant problem for you so it is better to quickly move to some effective heartburn treatment. but if we want to give some ideas from cooked vegetables lettuces and iceberg works out best. and you can have this too. this works great and show you the result very quickly.
Expected Response: the key to enjoying cookouts is to know what foods agree with you. if grease bothers you stick with grilled foods or vegetables. instead of tomatoes load up your salads with carrots beans jicama or other milder veggies. burgers are ok but get the leanest cuts and dress them with guacamole or something else less acidic than catsup. if carbonated drinks lead to late-night torture stick with iced tea. if margaritas and you don't get along drink less or switch to a virgin strawberry type. watermelon can be acid-producing. consign it to a mixed-fruit salad only. eat smaller portions. your stomach detects large amounts and pumps out more acid.

Question: i have had a cough since september. it goes away after antibiotics but comes back in a few days. . i have seen a dr. every 2-3 weeks. i have had 2 chest exrays and have had at least 3 rounds of antibiotics and 2 rounds of prednisone. i recently saw an allergist and he gave me 2 nasal sprays and heartburn medication that worked for 2 weeks but the cough is back and i am still taking the medication. he just prescribed a breathing treatment 3x per day. what type of specialist should i see?
Answer: you do not mention if you are a smoker or not. but you did not say if you are getting any relief or is this cough like an untreatable condition that still comes back. first i had first hand experience with coughing getting two to three hours an night (no cough during the day at that frequency). so after about two months just going thru regular dr. visits with antibiotics for chronic bronchitis. after the third antibiotic he said it was just taking time and just continue doing the same thing as i was doing and maybe do the coughing in hot steaming water his time. when it did not get any better i decided it was not time for bed expansion of lungs by lying on chest stretcher. a etkiddecer drove (not medical taste just wanted to see me get better - fisherman really do care about fishing partners). when we spent about an hour the next day in a boat way out in the gulf of mexico redfish hole and around lunch. i said that maybe the movement of the boat and the being out in the fresh salt air and not breathing all the bad air from the plants and refineries where i lived in this small town of 2 000 had made my cough better. further discussion and my dr. said this is what narrows the field of drs and ability of medicine to relieve a cough. if it is an allergy he may have the right combination of drs so that a proven treatment has the best chance to relieve you. this does palpate to a reasonable approach but i know what good results can be obtained after drs had said there was not much hope for relief. one time i answered an email (you know what it is like to try to compose and email at 2-3 am) as i did above and the gentleman answered a month later telling about good relief and we had a few follow up conversations before it was posted on the blogs and ed. but we had completely different coughs was not a smoker but i smoked for 54 years quite 15 years ago (that may have some bearing on the address and email info - accounting so to speak) continue to keep in touch with the site and you get the drift.
Expected Response: hi you need to see a pulmonologist or pulmonary disease specialist is a physician who possesses specialized knowledge and skill in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary (lung) conditions and diseases. but try this very simple thing first its just good cheese and onion sandwich's you eat 3 a day one at breakfast one at lunch times and the last one 30 minutes before bed get some real good cheddar cheese mature is best now if you can take the onion needs to be thick and good red onion for some real extra kick slice some garlic into it now you have to trust this and it will work this is old fashioned medicine and was used for a long time. but will tell you this it works for me time and time again. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: i was diagnosed with shingles with no oubreak. i am still in alot of pain. it's been 4 mos how much longer w/pain? . i have had an mri blood work and was on valtrex 3 days after pain started and never had an outbreak. i am on gabapentin and don't think it is helping but am taking it anyway. ice helps and is soothing. how much longer am i going to endure this pain? it's excruciating stabbing itching burning all on the left side. please help!
Answer: i had shingles for 4 months last year and am still off work i can basically only say take some serious pain medicine like laying in bed type of medicine. try to stay away from wearing shirts and anything else that may irritate the skin. it at least eased the crazy pain i was experiencing <positive_smiley> interesting and accurate\Context: sore pain
Expected Response: my mom just finished having shingles. she was in so much pain she could not stand it. she went on line looking for something that would take the pain and itching away. she came across a product that was expensive but at that point she didn't care. she purchased it and tried it. she could not believe it when her pain was gone and the itching was no longer. she still has one spot that itches everyday and i put some on that spot. it says on the jar that everything is all natural. it has been so worth the money to her. she has bought extra jars for family and friends that have gotten this. so far everyone of them said it took the pain away and stopped the itch. maybe it might help you. it is called terrasil and she found it on-line. i hope this might help you. vicki chick

Question: will melatonin supplements work on patients with hypothyroidism?
Answer: melatonin is a hormone and it too can be secreted by the body (usually at night). some people take supplements because they hope higher levels (from the pill) may help in certain. of course melatonin has to be broken down first in the liver and be absorbed pretty well to show an effect. studies show that the majority of melatonin is excreted through the stool. melatonin supplements can help put you to sleep if taken just before bedtime. many people find that they still get a good night's sleep without any really memorable/dreams while taking the drug during the winter months. now as for your second questions about people with hypothyroidism. well since melatonin is broken down by the liver i would be a bit cautious for people with high liver enzymes as again the active metabolite(s) can sit in your blood longer than someone with regular liver enzymes. you are best to consult with your health care provider to see if you are in a safe zone. best cvh.
Expected Response: melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states " it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. " i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin.

Question: i cut a chuck out of my finger with a peeler. i did get it to quit bleeding but how do i care for it now?
Answer: hi if the cut if quite deep have a look in your bathroom cabinet for a small bottle of tea tree oil if you have some put a couple of drops on the cut twice a day at night when you put on your johnny's just keep doing this it helps with healing plus its antiseptic and antifungal. good luck
Expected Response: obviously without the ability to examine your finger to determine the significance of this "chunk" that you have i can only offer you some general information. most of these avulsion injuries will heal over time. they will scab over and gradually. new skin will form over this area. larger "chunks" may require stitches to close. since i cannot see your injury you will need to make a judgment about seeking hands-on medical care. keep the wound clean to prevent infection. use a topical antibiotic ointment and keep in covered with a bandage until a scab forms.

Question: is black soap good for oily acne prone skin and is cocoa butter or vitamin e good for moisturizing oily acne prone skin?
Answer: my dermatologist recommended proactiv for acne and goes crazy if i even skip a day of applying it and also has me on tazorac afterward followed by their products but from this i highly recommend not doing it. i'm not the only proactiv user that has said this but the dermatologist said to try it and he was wrong. i was not the only person who had turned red as a tomato and it burned very much. no lotions seem to help either. it won't stop burning and the colors did not go away. this is horrible and i wish i could remove my mistake. never use this and for god's sake don't apply then wash off and reapply. my skin hurt and the bathroom turned into a bunch of pain squealing. redness can happen very easily so don't do it. hope this helped. basically do not use proactiv unless you clear it with a dermatologist and you're incredibly healthy skin and if you apply once in the beginning to see if there is an effect. if they claim to reduce size of acne and clear pimples then they are very wrong and wrong isn't even the word for it it is horrible. do not use it.
Expected Response: you may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours. dr. eric schweiger is well known as one of the country’s leading acne experts. he can help you with your acne problems. clear clinic - <link>

Question: i found a lump on my breast in the spot where my boyfriend bit me could the lump be in relation to the bite? . i am worried but i don't want to over react if it could just be some deep tissue bruising or swelling due to my boyfriend biting me.
Answer: no but this may be a clue to refrain from overly-rough amorous advances or to perhaps tone this activity from nintteen-ninety. here is a link to more info on breast lump: <link> since a lump is always a concern have your doctor take a look at this. hosting.telus足球比分直播aire.tom/vexmafares/breastcancer09. htm
Expected Response: who are you dating? hannibal lector? yes a bit can cause a deep bruise called a hematoma and this can form a lump for a while. it should eventually go away as you body reabsorbs the blood in this tissue. and if your boyfriend bites you again he should go away.

Question: hello there is a small white bulge under my foreskin where it connects to the penile shaft. should i be worried? . the white bulge is located where the foreskin connects to the penile shaft directly under the head of the penis. additionally the bulge appears to be located a the end of where two purple veins connect. it is soft to the touch and around 3-4mm in diameter. there is no pain or itchiness associated with the bulge. i should also note that it is not smegma as the white coloring is faint and appears to be under the foreskin and does not come off when washed.
Answer: he is trying to lure you into playing "pick-a-point " little games. He posts medical expert responses from very similar questions and if he is able to match these identical answers to 3 of his canned responses for your question he felt he won the game. here are 2 of the best answers: for the white sore throat: a sore throat should be looked at directly so there is no way that i can offer you an opinion without the benefit of a medical examination (i am not really an ent specialist). one of the simplest most common cause would be strep throat. a condition with this pathogen is treated with a course of antibiotics. only your doctor can diagnose and treat you since i do not know your medical history. the question about the tongue skin relationship: this really self-explanatory since you do not mention any disease/disorders that are relevant. when a question is so superficial and lacking in any relevant personal details no one can cause an accurate medical response about you and your son having tongues with white of the skin color. not one that would help and be right since most skin is really skin and not skin at all. the massage above should earn you a "point". regardless i urge you very strongly to not play these games that waste your valuable time. if you have a medical problem or a question for real medical experts it is always best just to post a question and include as many details about the medical issues as you possibly can.
Expected Response: you will need to have your medical provider examine this area carefully. unfortunately your description is really not sufficient to make this important call.

Question: is it safe to weight train when i have pressure in the temple/eye area associated with a sinus infection?
Answer: some decongestants can elevate blood pressures especially the otc choices so it would be wise to use a saline nasal spray or an aerobid nasal aerosol which will also open your sinuses but does not elevate blood pressure. machabees rule!
Expected Response: your head won't explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you. if it hurts. don't do it. a suggestion. decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight. in other words lower the intensity of your work-out at least for power-lifting until you feel better.

Question: my 2 year-old wants to be picked up very often. should i pick him up when he requests this? . my son just turned 2 last month. he is in daycare during the week and when he is home with mom & dad he very often wants "up". then he often wants mom or dad to go "this way" or "that way". am i doing harm by indulging him by picking him up upon his request to be picked up often. i want to be affectionate but i am afraid this is not good for him in the long-run.
Answer: as a father of three boys i would encourage you to pick up your son. i can tell you that it is one of the great joys of fatherhood that you should not be afraid to do. there is no surgery that can fix an aching back when your son/grown-up wants no part of being picked up. there is a time and a place and picking up your son is always a "good idea". i cant see a thing wrong with it but i am not a professional i wouldnt say that he would get bad habbits he does it to show he still needs you.
Expected Response: just pick him up. he may need a bit of extra affection that he is not getting in day-care. when you are holding him he feels that you will not go away. after a few minutes just put him down and play with him as a distraction. this will eventually stop. you don't see parents carrying older kids around in most cases.

Question: i need to find generics to treat my asthma and high blood pressure. i have medicare advantage insurance. what can i try?
Answer: here are some suggestions for savings and less expensive generics. <link>
Expected Response: this is a common question i get at the pharmacy. the first thing i ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications. if your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice. if you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs. many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting merck and astrazeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on.

Question: in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?
Answer: these are some real doctor responses from this website. <link> old generalities about eggs being bad for cholesterol have been dispelled in most cases where people have normal cholesterol levels. for a person who has high cholesterol like your father we often encourage patients to consume no more than two or three per week but some people can safely eat more routine eggs. fortunately there are still a lot of very good substitutes for eggs like egg beaters that can work much of the time. egg whites are slightly lower in protein than the eggs as a whole but still have all the essential aminos. eggs have some great nutritional benefits and in moderation consumption of a few eggs per day is considered just fine by many good health experts. the doctor that knows your father best would be the best resource to give him the green light to enjoy his eggs.
Expected Response: the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg whites more often should not increase the risk for heart disease. the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg white more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.

Question: i am 49 yrs old and my husband had a vasectomy done 5yrs ago is it menopause or pg<negative_smiley>? . keep in mind i have never been unfaithful to. my husband in the 32 yrs we have been married.
Answer: perhaps for twelve years i never saw my son and wife in the same vision. if i went to va beach he wasn't with us. i had joined the navy while blind it would turn out. since then all too slowly i relearned to see stereo. i expect your body and soul and the brain dominions engorged within contain an answer for you. if that is indeed possible then why not to you? you'd be the likely one wouldn't you? if you find something up with your right eye--eyes but particularly your right eye--email marc green <link> if you find something up with your left eye-email the guy. you might let him know about your right eye problem. palinopsia and searches or find a forum to join and most likely suffer homelessness. incidently some few weeks ago after a neuro-ophthy appointment i had driven east over the mountains through julian hours south and then over to the beach before returning south and to home. i had my stereo back and with that my pc monitor was flat (actual blue larger vibrant permissions) yow! it was the far hour of the evening and when i first noticed something at the periphery at the left i thought my brain was again playing manipulation games. it would be highly unlikely for you to be pregnant after having a tubal ligation. surgeons are very careful to make sure those fallopian tubes are cut cauterized and separated. there have been a few cases where the tubal was blotched but before thinking you are pregnant see you medical provider for a very accurate pregnancy test and careful examination<Order a HCG pregnancy test> that is exactly what this means. you want an accuracy and a utmoist precision and you want your honesty and your concept polish but sometimes. sometimes. you mostly wait thankthem and get on witrh your search for the answer to the q+uestion at hand
Expected Response: then you may be starting menopause. make an appointment with your gynecologist and have some selected blood tests to be sure.

Question: i got my nipples pierced 2 weeks ago. they are dry & itchy an get crustys on the balls of the barbell. are they infected. i put neosporin on them and yesterday i started putting bandaids on them. when i sqeeze them i see nothing oozing out but the day after i put the neo on them i see crustys on the balls?
Answer: it is a possibility that the nipples are infected due to this probably being your first time starting to pierce your nipple area. i suggest each time you clean your balls on your barbell to push that part of the barbell through and then push it back this way you are properly and thoroughly cleaning the barbell along with your piercings. a chance that they are just going through the healing process as well the first several weeks to months of getting your nipples pierced you will experience some type of crust (which is normally dried blood) and also swelling and redness. it's really hard to say it's just not going to be a really quick healing process with nipple barbells they really do take some time also maybe its the neosporin that is causing the dryness an benches to the breasts. i suggest letting pierced part come in contact with air and when you clean don't actually use soap on them that can irritate the skin a little make sure you are rinsing all soap off in the shower. also when you get out of the shower you could apply lotion around your breast with it coming into contact with the nipple so the lotion doesn't come into contact with the piercing itself i also suggest not to rub the lotion around these areas with the piercing and then continue to clean your piercing after. i am sure that helps and i also suggest that when you sleep you don't twist and turn with the covers on your chest and that you are sleeping while on your back this way you are not irritating the piercing as much during sleeping. and when sleeping it also benefits wearing a bra this way at night you are not able to twist and turn an itch and possibly harm the piercing. it's just a long healing process but stick with it if your fully committed to doing it. and don't listen to those who tell you the ball should just twist off easily to change it because this isn't always secure to just have the ball just twist off so to twist off you could take a peice gooey phone cords and use that as a grip and hold it while twisting the ball. and remember it's okay to feel uncomfortable pain and so much sensitivity through the first few weeks it's 100% norm. just like not freaking about if the ball sits on the top of your nipple hours to a day after you get it pierced because that ball can sit on that n on your barbell and it won't cause it to heal wrong. hope this helped
Expected Response: yes there is a very good chance that you have a secondary infection that may require more than just topical neosporin. i would suggest that you see a medical professional to have your oozing pierced nipples properly examined and treated. you may need an oral antibiotic.

Question: is it possible to get pregnant from sharing a bathroom with somebody? . i'm 14 years old and i've skipped my period recently. this has happened before due to stress or anxiety but this time it's different. i've noticed my stomach is kind of bloated and it feels hard when i poke or feel it. i obviously have not had sex. like none at all. because that's illegal. anyways i share a bathroom with my dad and this is the weird part i'm just afraid sperm could get in a towel or on a toilet seat or something like that.
Answer: every woman has certain fears about becoming pregnant regardless of how you have sex or don’t have anal sex. it’s a legitimate fear so just focus on using good contraceptive practice (in case you slip) and also real education about sex and reproduction. even though you are 14 patients have been made aware of “contraceptive exceptions” unintended pregnancies meaningful dialogue among parents adolescent’s and significant others is essential. all types of attempts at becoming educated are important. i’m sure you share the bathroom with other people not just your dad and regardless of where you live there is likely some collective education about physical health. consume it and base your sexual and reproductive choices on what is important to both you and your family. “fear of pregnancy” is your body’s way of heightening your need to protected yourself. rather than having this fear evidence serve as an excuse for refraining from sex get the right resources and education about taking care of your body and work actively for a type of care that’ll be in your and your future babies life-long health. as a nurse who has worked with teenage mothers it’s very important that you have identified an appropriate place of health and an identified primary clinician that is interested in helping you. talk to your mom or dad about getting good advice and resources.
Expected Response: hi yes stress and anxiety will stop periods and so will your hormones exercise or trying to loss weight but also at 14 it often happens when your periods just stop could be for 6 months then restart it just happens to young women. as for sperm on towels if you don't trust your father try having your own towel and keep it in your room as for the toilet seat i do not ever recall a women getting pregnant that way most women get pregnant from full penetrating sex but next time just wipe the toilet seat. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: i am anyday getting my period i have signs of being pregnant today i feel i am going to start my period am i pregnant?
Answer: it could be 50/50. i have a regular cycle between 26-29 days it's suppose to be 27 days and my cycle runs 6 days. i had implantation 7 days before my missed period and negative tests (pee test and blood labs test) 2 days before my missed period. i really thought i was pregnant when my period came it broke my heart. period was crampy clumps and lasted 6 days. most people don't respond well to tests because of the hcg hormone some just have to wait for a while after missed period while some show right away. my mother and sister could pee and blood test day period is due and it came out positive with both my sister and mother's blood lab the only time they tested before missing a period it was negative. just keep your chin up some cycle can vary up to 30 days in length the first time i was pregnant with my youngest it was shorter by a length of 5 days with my first and 18 days with my second. have faith good luck.
Expected Response: okay this has happened to me before and trust me its most likely that you are just making yourself worried. if you are getting your period any day now then youre not even technically late yet. what signs of pregnancy? because nausea food cravings/different food tastes/favorite foods making you sick dizziness mood swings lower back pain chest pain tiredness are all common period symptoms. its probably just pms. and you wouldnt feel like you were about to start your period if you were pregnant. you wouldnt even have minor cramps. until you are significantly late dont worry. and if after a week of not having your period just take a pregnancy test. simple. you may feel panicked right now but dont get ahead of yourself. just wait it out.

Question: i'm the only family member who got a flu shot and i have the flu and they don't. what could explain this?
Answer: all the people who did not get a flu shot were probably exposed to the strain of the flu for which you were not vaccinated. the flu shot is not foolproof and may only 1/3 of all potential flu bugs (the most likely one of each of the expected three types of strain). your flu may also not be influenza so i am not sure this is the explanation either. it is impossible to know unless you have a positive flu test to begin with. while unsatisfying i know. the flu is weird. the flu i had this time was the deadliest case i've ever gotten and it wasn't even as bad as the stuff that led to a day or two of bedrest as a child. i don't know.idepressants changed my life. i finally have energy and feel normal cute purses for sale on etsy <link>
Expected Response: most helpful answer every person is different. the flu shot is not 100% protective -- many of my patients who got the flu vaccine this year developed a mutating strain of the flu. and influenza is often misdiagnosed so did you have a lab test to prove you have influenza? per the question below the doctor took a nasal swab; the result said i had influenza type a.

Question: will taking cephalexin interfere with birth control?
Answer: cephalexin is not known to affect birth control pills cattle2121 as you have been told. it is one of the few commonly used antibiotics that do not have this effect. take care of your bladder infection. a person can stand a bright bottle and examining the effects but no one practical example is the fact that the economic orb allows you to assess almost any aspect of the structure. as for cbmi it works very well through various economic factors this is why it is difficult to compare it properly.
Expected Response: no. there is no evidence that cephalexin will affect birth control pills. it is a common belief that all antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of birth control pills though that is not always the case. missing a dose of your birth control pill or vomiting or diarrhea from your antibiotic may affect your hormone level. these reactions could affect the efficacy of your pills. talk to your pharmacist about any of your concerns regarding drug interactions. they can help.

Question: my friend is 85 and was diagnosed in dec with advanced liver cirrhosis. has been drained 2x. what is his life expectancy? . please help me determine his life expectancy as i live far away and need to visit him
Answer: his life-horizon is now short and he should spend some quality time with family and friends instead of being gloomy and misrable. may be that would be his time and he may not require a 3rd drainage. about near future it's hard to predict one month but for decades it's not possible now. you can attend him for a few days and hand over his guardians to somemore responsible and local family member.
Expected Response: visit him as soon as you can. it is not really possible to accurately guess anyone's life expectancy especially someone that i do not know as a patient. his condition appears to be quite serious and is complicated by his age. if you can't visit. call or write letters but if your plan is to see him then i would suggest that you do so soon.

Question: is there a generic for cymbalta?
Answer: there is not a generic for cymbalta. you have wet in your email offering where you say no generic but there is a generic available for all other medications listed but for the cymbalta. error? no just and idiot tech. oh wait that's me. the difference is quite significant in that you're talking a savings of a couple of hundred dollars per month. in wonder where eli lilly would put the blame? if it in generic form an attorney would be chasing them around in circles as far as effexor i believe there is a generic. there hasn't been one but my healthcare provider just put me on it answering_posts@webmd. net_fivebux cheaper than the copay for cymbalta and binefits and side effests are the same. for more savings they upped the dose for me. so it would be possible for some kind of credit due points to show that buying the mail order cheaper is a non-option at lowest cost limitelligent dose with great results. bought generic for about 5 years at $10. a month. increased cost now $90. through bcbs. generic = olanzapine which medicine dictates true name & therefore 100% of cost even before individual insurance deductible of $3 700. powered by homes for rent your comments comments 1: comment from valeria hi just click on drugs tab at top page above and do cialis then options then do drugs a - z and enter cymbalta you may well find a german equivalent if not a mexican one or chinese anyway contact them they do answer.
Expected Response: cymbalta is not available as a generic. prior to making a recommendation to your health care provider i would ask for what reason are you taking cymbalta. depending on your condition you might consider asking your health care provider to prescribe you a drug within the same class as cymbalta that has a generic version. thanks for the question.

Question: i am taking ampicillin for a uti. i am worried it isn't treating it. how long should it take to feel no symptoms? . i was diagnosed with a uti. the doctor put me on cipro but due to previous issues with utis and kidney infections i asked them to culture my sample. a week later they called to tell me the bacteria in my urine was b streptococcus. i still had symptoms so they placed me on ampicillin which i have now been taking for 5 days. i still have symptoms and only 2 more days on the antibiotic. do i need to worry that it isn't being treated? should i call for a new antibiotic?
Answer: 49while ampicillin can be used to treat a variety of bacterial infections many varieties of gram-positive (in this case group b streptococcus or gbs) are resistant. there are other forms of penicillin that are effective against gbs but in this situation it is likely your health care provider chose ampicillin because it is generally well tolerated and inexpensive. we are taught that many medical conditions are "self limiting". which means that with or without treatment the patient will get better. unfortunately when a person has an infection any delay in treatment can allow for a period for the infection to multiply or to become more resistant. in your particular case you got almost a week of effective appropriate antibiotic (cipro) yet you did not improve. now you are on a less sensitive antibiotic. as much as i can try to convince you to have faith and stick with the current med my need to change to a different drug that will be more effective would probably win over. but because of this strange medical philosophy (does your physician know you are a person and not a concept? ) i will not become that second opinion since i am just a cyberspace voice of reason. and i can't examine you and take care of your properly with my practical hands. as you elude you don't seem to be happy with your health care provider. so if you now ask me what to do i would suggest you consult a specialist. i rarely reject other medical opinions other than mine. in this case you may save me some time since it seems that you have turn your back on your provider. again i do not reject second opinions and you may be a valid candidate at this point. hope i helped some. but just know i feel your pain.
Expected Response: have the urine re-cultured after you are off the ampicillin. you may need to be examined to look for other possible causes to account for your continuing symptoms and definitely get examined if you are having any back (kidney area) pain.

Question: how is anemia caused by decreased red blood cell production treated?
Answer: this site claims to gove answers for free but it is total rubbish
Expected Response: the type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production. with iron deficiency anemia your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron which your body can absorb easily. timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. if you use iron supplements remember the following cautions: * always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. excess iron intake can be harmful. symptoms of iron overload include fatigue vomiting diarrhea headache irritability heart disease and joint problems. * iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children. iron poisoning is the most common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. eating even a few tablets can prove fatal in a matter of hours. symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness confusion nausea vomiting and diarrhea. seek medical help immediately. * watch for side effects. you may need to continue taking iron supplements for up to one year. taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects which may include nausea diarrhea constipation and stomach pain. let your doctor know if you continue to have side effects. different formulations are available. * watch for drug interactions. tell your doctor if you are being treated for another condition. for example calcium supplements interfere with iron absorption so it is best to take them at different times of the day. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. good dietary sources of iron include red meat beans egg yolk whole-grain products nuts and seafood. many processed foods and milk are also reinforced with iron. your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts including hematocrit hemoglobin and ferritin levels during treatment. if your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. in rare cases your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). in extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia treatment may involve a blood transfusion

Question: infant runny bowel movements. my 2 month old son has had very runny bowel movements since birth. we have checked with his doctor changed his formula and still have had no changes. his bm's most often happen before he has even finished a. 5-6 oz. bottle. he also grunts a lot as if constipated. wehave gotten no answers from out dr and are very concerned.
Answer: at 2 month stool is usually not very well formed. the fact your son may start to bm before finishing his bottle is not unusual at all however it may be normal and it may not. please talk with the doctor again. they have many more details of your son's case than can be posted in a limited space along with some visual knowledge of your son. they may want to change formulas again or tell you that a complete stool sample may be needed at this point. if no changes are made you may want a second opinion. i know it is trite advice but remember the old addage "doctors only get the training cases. the average parent gets the three of a kind. " good luck to you.
Expected Response: two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!

Question: can osteoarthritis in back cause pain in my lft gluteal muscle into hip joint down frnt thigh and not be able to walk? . i frequently have the pain in my gluteal muscle and the pain in my hip joint. after too much house work or shopping the pain gets really bad in my hip into the side and front of my thigh. it has gotten severe enough that i can not lift my leg to walk. after sitting a while i can walk again but it comes back. ice relives the pain and after about a week of using ice sometimes over-night pain in my thigh leaves. can arthritis cause these issues?
Answer: it would be best for you to unscramble your response. we cannot decipher it so it would be best if you just posted a clear response.
Expected Response: i had the same type of pain. my doctor said the femoral nerve was being compressed in my back and sent me for therapy. i was very doubtful about this but after a few weeks of therapy the pain disappeared. the main exercise was: stand a few inches from a wall place hands flat on the wall at chest level. press the lower body forward a few inches repeat 30 times 2 or 3 times a day. don't over-extend just press forward as long as it is comfortable.

Question: what is implantable contraception?
Answer: the above answers are all off the mark but i have a correct one. iuds (intrauterine devices) are long-acting reversible contraceptive methods. there are two fda-approved devices on the u. s. market: one is hormonal (mirena) which contains the hormone progestin (levonorgestrel) and the other (paragard) is a copper-containing device. both are able to reside in the body for a number of years. they are excellent forms of contraception as is implantable contraception. the difference between an iud and implantable contraception is the end location of the implemented device. i also want to note that i am not aware of any u. s. fda-approved implantable contraceptives that have been given specific approval for as many as 10 years of use. i believe that the 10 years mentioned below as possibly the time frame for the skyla`s use is a misinterpretation by the writer. this iud is approved for 3 years of use in the u. s. the approval for the skyla is for parous women. women who have given birth vaginally. in general iuds are super choices for most women unless they have a personal history of pelvic inflammatory disease (usually caused by the sexually transmitted organism chlamydia) have an abnormally formed uterus (congenital anomaly) have untreated cervicitis (infection of the cervix) or an active pelvic infection. although copper iuds have a longer duration it bears mentioning that the skyla is smaller and has the lowest daily release of hormone of 3 iud models making this a good choice for a large group of women. the procedure is quick with minimal if any pain. see: link to skyla website my recommendation is that women speak with their gynecologists or knowledgeable healthcare providers regarding their interest in iud or other contraceptive choices and be sure the provider is skilled with insertion of the iud device before proceeding. the paragard effectiveness: last up to 12 years it is coated with copper to prevent sperm functioning about $800 to buy the device about $800 to get it inserted <positive line 99. 4% elements=price s side_effects size review applied science introduced in the 1970's. source: clinincaltrials. govurement tel? lang=en from the national health service: how long-expulsion failures so what's the best iud for your birth control needs? 2dc426/nn14_8sh site nice. org. uk could be authorised for 10 years use capable of being fitted shortly after a childbirth. could apply this to its effectiveness. aim is single hand and thread. will be aimed at both the post-delivery and post-abortion market? price seems to be good. best model for you. best person is a good clinician. just google skyla the url should tell you a lot about it. 99. 4% seems to be the time independent effectiveness. this has now made this answer pretty safe to psot. good luck
Expected Response: a single rod containing progestin that is implanted by your doctor under the skin. it is effective for up to 3 years and can be removed earlier. you can find more information from the american society for reproductive medicine on this topic here: <link> it's a form of birth control that should protects against pregnancy for up to 3 years. the implant which looks like a rod is about the size of a matchstick and is implanted under the skin by your doctor. it's easily removable by your doctor when you want to plan a pregnancy and fertilty returns to normal without any delay. like all forms of contraception there are side effects that you should consider such as weight gain irregular bleeding acne mood changes and headache. this method is considered nearly 100% effective with less than one pregnancy occurring for every one hundred women using an implant for a year. it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. however you can reduce your risk by using a latex condom every time you have vaginal oral or anal sex.
