Question: what is delta hepatitis?
Baseline Response: delta hepatitis is the most common form of hepatitis. It is a virus that has been circulating in the United States since 1873. It affects about 8 percent of the population. It was first discovered in 1892. In the United Kingdom, hepatitis was first introduced into the United states in 1894. It has been reported in the U.S. since then.
Source: U.K. Department of Health
In the United Nations, there are about 400,000 cases of hepatitis in the world. Most of these are caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, which is spread by a virus.
The virus is then transmitted to humans through the urine of the person, causing inflammation and vomiting. The virus can also cause diarrhea and other diseases.
It is important to know that the number of people who have hepatitis can be very small, and therefore are susceptible to it.
You may also be exposed to it through contact with other

Expected Response: delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis b. the delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis d or hdv) is an rna virus meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. it is spread through exposure to contaminated blood especially with illicit intravenous drug use and by sexual contact. delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis b. when this happens infected people are quite sick but more than 95% are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. people who already have chronic hepatitis b can acquire delta hepatitis as well. this often causes severe inflammation of the liver and the viruses are less likely to be cleared. delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis b much worse. it increases the risk of complications especially cirrhosis which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. there is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. prevention includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners using barrier methods of contraception). universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis b vaccine effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis b virus.

Question: who manufactures actos? my mother can’t afford it & sometimes skips her dose. do they offer an assistance program?
Baseline Response: the "Roma" plant has been in the market for a long time. I think it has a lot of potential but it would require a lot more than just a few hours of training.
I have been working on the plant for about a year now and I still can't find a good place to get started. I've been told the plants are not all that expensive, but they have been selling out for over a year.
It's not my intention to stop. I'm a big fan of the plant and it's been a pleasure working with it for so long. I hope to be able to sell more plants in the future.
If you can't afford the price of the plants, I would like to offer you a discount.
What do you think of the new "Romo" plant?
I

Expected Response: the manufacturer of actos is takeda pharmaceuticals. if you go to www. actos. com and click on "special offers" you will see three different types of programs to help with the cost of the medication. you are thinking the right way: if she skips her medication she will put herself in greater danger and may end up in the hospital -- which would definitely be a bigger bill. if you need help on locating these types of programs talk to your pharmacist; we are happy to help.

Question: can a breast feeding mother take dapakote. my daughter in law suffers from grand mal seizures and is taking seizure medication along with thyroid medication. she had thyroidectomy (thyroid removed 4 years ago and now the doctor has put her on dapakote er to manage her seizures migraine headaches and mood instability she refuses to take it in fear that it will her 3 month old baby boy that she is breast feeding. can the dapakote harm the baby? the doctor says no any input on this?
Baseline Response: yes, it does.
Answer 1:
Answer 2:

Expected Response: hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about 5% of valproate in the mother’s blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the baby’s bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck

Question: what should i do when my baby starts teething and cries a lot?
Baseline Response: if your baby is in a position where you can't reach him or her, you can try to get him or hers to stop crying. It's not hard to do, but it's not always easy to get the right answer.
Here's the best advice:
"Get a good baby and start breathing in. It will help to be able to talk a lot, and can be a real lifesaver."
And here's the problem with that advice: I think the best way to get your baby to stop screaming is by doing something like this:
1) start breathing slowly and softly
2) stop crying and start crying
3) stop moving your hands
4) start getting up and moving your feet
5) start talking
6) stop holding your baby's hand or baby's arm or baby crying
7) start moving your face or face up or down

Expected Response: a teething baby often likes to suck chew and gnaw on things. teething rings can help or often i’ll have parents get a washcloth wet then twist it or roll it up and put it in the freezer or fridge and once it’s cold let the baby chew on that. or you can try freezing a mini-bagel and let them chew on it -- but depending on how young they are you have to be careful keeping an eye on baby so that they don’t bite off a big piece. sometimes i’ll have a parent give a teething baby an appropriate dose of acetaminophen at night which helps soothe the baby and minimize the pain so the baby can sleep longer. i will say to be careful with topical solutions; be careful that you don’t overdo them. i’d recommend checking with your physician before you use them. try a refrigerated pacifier or teether. don't store the teether in the freezer because when frozen it can get hard enough to damage a baby's gums. there are a variety of refrigerated teethers including some with plastic handles so your baby's hands won't get cold. if nothing is working and your baby needs relief your doctor might recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. (note: don't give new medicines to a baby without first checking with a doctor. ask the doctor for the proper dosage whenever giving acetaminophen to a child younger than 2. ) your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth called primary teeth break through the gums. when does teething typically start? teething usually begins around 6 months of age. but it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. also find a good dental clinic which consists of experienced pediatricians who will help to give your child proper oral care. there are some great dental clinics which consists of services not only in child dentistry but also in other dental areas like cerec restoration dental implants neuromuscular dentistry and many more.

Question: my 3 year old just had his tonsiles removed. and he refusing to drink. can giving him a bath help with hydration? . he will crunch on shaved ice but i don't think he is getting enough to drink. he is eating baby food which i assume has some water to it but not much. he is in a lot of pain and we want to make sure he gets enough fluid. will letting him soak in a bath help at all. i know drinking water or gatorade etc is best but looking for some alternatives.
Baseline Response: My 3 year olds just had their tonsiles cut off. and they refused to drink..they were just eating baby foods which i assumed had some water. they were eating baby meat which i thought was good but was not. and the kid was just eating a lot and i felt like he was eating baby oil.

Expected Response: unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.
================================================================================
Question: do foods that have been pickled -- like canned beets -- still maintain their original nutritional value?
Baseline Response: Yes, they do. But it is not their original nutritive value. And when they are pickled, they will retain their original nutrient value. That is what is called a "food-quality measure," which is a measure that reflects the nutritional value of the food, not the original nutritional values of the ingredients.
If you ask a farmer in Iowa what he thinks the nutritional values are, he will say, "I don't know. But I'm sure I can tell you what they're like."
The problem with this is that if you ask the farmer, "What is the nutritional content of the foods he's eating?" the farmer will say "It's very simple. I don't have to tell you. I just can tell that to you."
When you ask him, "How much do you want to eat?" the farmers will say they

Expected Response: since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesn’t significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you don’t want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

Baseline Response: the acne on my left assock is pretty much the same as it was under my right buttock - almost the same. the bumps are still there but they're getting larger. my left side is almost completely covered in acne scars. i have acne on the left side of my left thigh which i had before and is very noticeable. i can't say how much of a difference it makes to me. i

Expected Response: if you have a primary care doc go see him or her it may be yeast or just a rash. could be as simple as the type of material you wear in your underwear or have you changed soaps in your laundry? or changed the kind of soap you wash your body with. be sure to keep the area clean and dry and wear loose fitting pants around the house to let it get air. i would try some cortisone cream to see if you get relief if not then you might want to see a dermatologist to rule out other skin infections. been to the beach lately? sometimes sand mites and fleas can cause this type of thing if the beach is a no then see a doctor or at least one online.

Question: occasionally i have a 'condition' where i smell something similar to what diesel smells like every time i breathe. . when i inhale all i smell is what smells like diesel. this lasts for anywhere from three days to two weeks and it stops as suddenly as it starts. i have not noticed anything that specifically 'triggers' it. just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and what may be causing it and if i can do something to avoid or stop it. i have type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and severe asthma and not sure if any or all of these contribute to this.
Baseline Response: i have no idea.

Expected Response: your smelling of diesel sounds like a phantom odor that really does not exist in the environment. there is a disorder called phantosmia. it presents itself in the form of an olfactory (smell sense) type of hallucination. it can be caused by nerve damage to the brain's olfactory system certain toxins and medications emotional stress trauma and viruses. it is also a condition sometimes seen in epilepsy. resolution is directed at treating the root cause.

Question: is there a way to reverse arthritis or slow down the progression of it
Baseline Response: No, not at all. There are a number of treatments available to slow the progression.
It is not a cure for the disease.
What is the best treatment for arthritis?
The best treatment is to be able to get a doctor's appointment at the end of the month, or early in the morning.
If you are having arthritis, it is time to go to your doctor.
You can talk to your GP about this, and the doctor may suggest the treatment.
Why do people with arthritis have arthritis?

Expected Response: hi i'm a big fan of herbs and did read about how good cayenne pepper was for arthritis. so just google arthritis and cayenne pepper and have a good read. i do take cayenne pepper daily for ed but have found its goit rid of the arthritis pains in one of my hands for the last couple of years. now i take mine in tomato paste when you mix it just add some olive oil to thin it down with this i take fine chopped garlic and parsley your find this is also good for arthritis all very good for the blood as well. now when you first mix the cayenne pepper just mix to a heat that suits you over time you can incress that amount up just put a tea spoon of the garlic mix on top mix it into the top and take 3 small spoonful's each morning first thing and see just how you get on you wont find its a quick fix but will work over time. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is torticollis?
Baseline Response: torticolls are small, single-use, non-deterministic vertebrate appendages. They are the most common vertebrate vertebrate of the genus Torticollidae. They have the largest number of vertebrate species in the world, and are the only vertebrate in the genus that are able to walk. They can also walk on the ground, and can carry small prey, like a deer, as well as the eggs of other animals. Torticolls also have the ability to walk on their own.
Why do torticolises get on the same limb?
It is because of their smaller body mass, so they are able "to walk" more quickly and at higher speeds.
What is the difference between torticole and tibet?
Tibet is a more slender, long-necked vertebrate. Its body is also very long.
How do tortoises walk?

Expected Response: torticollis is a very common condition in which your baby may hold his head to one side. this usually starts while the baby is still in the womb. over time this may lead to having a flat head (plagiocephally). if identified early your doctor can suggest some neck stretching exercises to help loosed up the tight neck muscles and preserve a symmetric round head.

Baseline Response: 9mos old man has a fever and he's sleeping so bad he's almost fussy. . a month ago he was fussy but he has now gone to the hospital for

Expected Response: finding the reason (or reasons) why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge. it could be teething. remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen. he doesn't have to have a fever to use it. if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem. children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods. the only problem is that they can't tell us. make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms. eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms. check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well.
================================================================================
Question: how will the affordable care act affect supplemental medical coverage such as coverage for patients with cancer?
Baseline Response: The Affordable Care Act will increase the number of uninsured Americans. It will allow insurance companies to offer more health coverage for those who have low incomes. It also will reduce the number and size of "outsider" plans that do not cover primary care. This is expected to create a major increase in the number uninsured Americans in the future.
How will the Affordable Care act affect premium rates?
The Affordable Care law will increase rates for individuals who are uninsured, but they will not be able to buy insurance. The ACA will increase premiums for individuals with incomes of less than $50,000, and for those with incomes between $50 and $100,000.
Will the Affordable care act make it harder for people to buy coverage for their medical needs?
Yes. The Affordable care law will lower the number people who qualify for subsidies, and will reduce subsidies for those not eligible

Expected Response: the aca has no impact on supplemental insurance policies. if you are interested in buying cancer coverage because you feel you're at high risk you may do so. however these plans never qualify as comprehensive medical coverage so you'll still need to have more traditional health insurance.

Question: what would cause a fluttering sound in my ear?
Baseline Response: fluttering is caused by the fact that a sound is a constant motion of a particle.
A fluttering noise is one that is not continuous, or that does not have a constant velocity. A fluttering particle does not change its position as a particle, but it does change its motion as it moves in the direction of the particle. The particle's motion is determined by the number of particles it is moving. If a flutter is a flicker, the particles that are moving will not be fluttering.
Fluttering sounds are caused by two particles.
a flutter particle moves by a certain amount of time.
b flutter particles move by a particular amount of speed.
When a particle moves faster than a particle moving slower, the particle moves slower. A particle that moves faster may be moving at a slower speed than a slower particle moving at the same speed. When a particle is moving at

Question: why isn't my baby sleeping through the night?
Baseline Response: it's because I'm a little too lazy to take care of myself.
If you've ever heard of the word "sleep" you'll know that it refers to a state of being that is either cold, tired, or feeling hungry. The problem is that when you're in a state where you're just not doing anything, you can't get out of it. So why should I sleep through the day? Well, let's say you have an illness. You're not going to be able to sleep through all the night, so why not try something a bit different?
Just like when you start off on the right track, you will find that the first step towards making progress is to get your body ready for the night. It's a very simple process, but it's something that you can do for yourself and your baby.
Here's a quick recap of some of the steps that you'll need

Expected Response: is your baby sleeping through the night? it’s the question every parent of a newborn gets. how well does he or she sleep at night? and every new parent asks the other related question: when will my baby sleep through the night? ever? (never? ) no two babies are alike. that’s true when it comes to sleep as well. i’ve heard from parents whose babies sleep well like a baby — through the night — as early as six weeks old. and then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their baby’s birth. what gives? in the first few weeks of life babies don’t have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. this rhythm or body clock starts ticking at around six weeks of age. but what’s more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. in other words it’s not so much that babies are missing the “on” and “off” switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. it’s that babies cannot hold enough food (i. e. breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. it takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. and because breast milk in particular gets digested more quickly than formula moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. but here’s some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: a new study published in the journal pediatrics and done by researchers from the university of canterbury new zealand states that by the age of 5 months over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents’ sleeping times — and sleeping right through the night. sound too good to be true? well this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents’ sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. there’s a difference between a baby matching his or her parents’ sleeping schedule and sleeping “through the night. ” the researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long but its coinciding with the parents’ schedule takes longer. for example a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. but a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from say 11 p. m. to 5 a. m. may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. despite the statistics sometimes babies just don’t comply with what’s considered “average” or “normal. ” and sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. hopefully that’s sooner rather than later. but there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category — the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. here they are: * get a. m. light: make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. this will help set the body clock up and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * preserve nap time: babies nap routinely throughout the day usually once in the morning and another in the afternoon. though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to “save” sleep time for the night this will backfire. babies who get the full extent of their naps in sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. and they just might grow up smarter thanks to their naps. * cluster feed: to overcome the challenge of keeping your baby’s belly satiated through the night see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then “top-off” his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. that way he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * try the eat sleep play method: we used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. the key here is consistency in the schedule: if it is sleep time and you are out get home and get them to bed it will pay off. and for those who try everything and nothing works consult your pediatrician there could be reflux (sometimes called colic) or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. then be patient. one night your baby will surprise you. you’ll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. as you rush to the crib to check on your little one you realize that all is well. all are asleep. and so should you be too.

Question: can acid reflux cause sleepless nights and disruptive breathing and constant burping?
Baseline Response: there is no clear answer, but there is a possibility of the effect of acid reflow on the lungs.
This may seem like a lot of work, but it's true. As I said in the previous post, acid reflows are reversible. The problem with the acid refluoride is that it can cause an acute respiratory arrest, which is why it is recommended to stop the acid. I have seen people who have been in the hospital for over a year who have not had the acid for some reason. The solution is to take a lot more acid and see if it can be stopped.
The reason for this is that there is little information available about how to stop acid reflation.
In general, the acid is usually absorbed by the lungs and then the airways. The acid then travels to the liver and eventually through the circulation to the kidneys. The kidneys

Expected Response: hi 4d yes but have ever tried drinking some nice cold milk straight fron the fridge works wonders for me but if its really bad and its a nightly thing then good old milk and magnesia should settle it down for a good nights sleep. but if this is becoming a big problem you should see your doctor. good luck

Question: what topical analgesics are used to treat osteoarthritis?
Baseline Response: A topical analgesic is a topical drug that has a specific effect on the skin or on the tissues of the body that are affected by the pain. It has been shown that topical analgesia can be used to control pain, pain relief, pain management and other conditions that may affect the health of the skin.
A systemic analgesic, such as the topical ibuprofen or the fluoxetine, has been used as a treatment for pain in some people for some time. However, there is no evidence that the effectiveness of the systemic analgesics in treating pain is high in some patients.
In the current study, we examined the efficacy of a topical analgesium, the lorazepam, in treating osteoarthropathy in patients with osteoarticular osteoarsis. We found that the loroazepams significantly improved pain relief and reduced pain management in

Expected Response: topical analgesics are creams ointments and balms that are rubbed onto the skin where you have joint pain. most are available without a prescription and use one or more of the following to help control pain: capsaicin – a natural pain-blocker found in cayenne peppers counterirritants – menthol oil of wintergreen camphor eucalyptus oil turpentine oil dihydrochloride and methlnicotinate all distract your body from pain salicylates – also found in many oral pain relievers these work by blocking hormone-like substances in your body that add to pain. one topical analgesic voltaren gel is available only by prescription.

Question: what should i do if i suspect an overdose of flu cold & cough medicine?
Baseline Response: get a prescription for flu cold cold medicine (for example, the flu vaccine for the flu virus). This can be a very helpful and effective way to get the flu cold vaccine for your colds.
How to get flu cold medicine from pharmacies:
If you are unsure if you have an influenza vaccine, you can get a flu cold from a pharmacy in the state of New York.
If your pharmacy does not have flu cold medicines, you need to go to your local hospital and get a doctor's recommendation.
What should I do if I suspect an influenza cold?
If there is a possibility that you are having a cold, you should go to the hospital immediately.
Get a doctor to see if you are in good health.
Do not take any medications.
Tell your doctor if you feel ill.
Talk to your doctor about whether you are going to have a

Expected Response: if overdose is suspected contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canada residents can call a provincial poison control center. symptoms of overdose may include: agitation confusion hallucinations seizures.

Question: can a regular doctor inject fillers or do i need to see a plastic surgeon or dermatologist?
Baseline Response: You have to ask your doctor before you use any fillers. There is no way to know if your doctor is doing the right thing or not. If your doctor tells you to take the fillers, then you should ask for a referral from the doctor. You should also ask for your insurance company to send you a copy of the filler you have been using.
I'm allergic to fillers and I'm worried about the potential for a allergic reaction. If you're allergic to any of the following ingredients, then your doctor should prescribe a doctor's prescription. This can be done at any pharmacy, or through your health care provider. If there are any medications that you are allergic to, you should talk to your doctor first. If this is the case, you can call your doctor at (800) 933-6800 or visit their website for more

Expected Response: it's really important to have an aesthetic physician which would be a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to do these techniques and these treatments in order to have the most natural lasting results. these are treatments that are very technique sensitive. we have great ingredients. but they have to be done in the proper way in the proper plane of the skin so sometimes it's more superficial and sometimes it's deeper in the skin. we used different products for different parts of the face. so it is really important to see a doctor that you feel comfortable with to do these injections for you.

Expected Response: there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

Question: i was in a bike accident and i may have ruptured a breat implant. will insurance cover a ruptured breast implant?
Baseline Response: I have a broken breast implant and my insurance company will cover the repair.
Answer 1: i am in a motorcycle accident and my insurer will cover it. i am not insured. i have a rupturing breast implant. i will be insured for the repair, i am covered for the next 6 months.
I have a puncture wound on my breast that is too big for my breast. i can't take care of it. can someone help me with my pain?
I am in the same situation as you. I have rupturing my breast implant, it is the first time in my life that i have ruptures. i dont know how to help. can anyone help me?
Hello, I am a nurse in the United States who has a rupture breast implant that is 5 months old. i was on a motorcycle ride

Expected Response: whether or not an insurer pay for a procedure depends on whether it's considered medically necessary. if the procedure is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. although breast implants in most cases are not covered by insurance it's possible that a ruptured implant could present a medical issue that insurance would cover. contact your insurance company to find out what your policy is likely to cover. and i would quickly consult with your physician to learn what needs to be done and see if you can get his or her help in justifying the need for insurance coverage to fix it.

Baseline Response: i am pregnant or dead. on 10 th of january i was offered a new job. i was told that if i didn't work i would get laid. i didnt like the job so i was laid off. I was in the car and was thinking about my boyfriend. he was having a hard time getting a job so he came to the door and said that i was having an affair. i said ok i would like to go back to my boyfriend but he said that he would not let

Question: i had sex 11 yrs ago before my wife. is there chance of getting gonorea from that girl as i'm having the symptoms now.
Baseline Response: i was having sex in my room on the couch. my wife called and told me to get off and get dressed. i went to bed and got ready to go to bed. she said she was going to be there when i got off. i got up and went to the bathroom and there was my husband. i told him that i was with my wife and that i had to get dressed because i felt ill. i then went to my room and she told me that i needed to go check on my husband and that he needed to be taken care of. i came back and said that i would get him on his way back to my wife's room. she then took me to my car and drove me to the doctor. i was so scared and scared of what would happen to my husband if i were to get pregnant

Expected Response: eleven years ago? it would be next to impossible for you to carry gonorrhea for 11 years without any symptoms. painful urination and penile discharge that would have surely motivated you to seek medical care. there are other stds like hpv or syphilus that you could harbor this long so if you are in doubt. just get tested.
================================================================================
Question: can you test for flu without a fever being present?
Baseline Response: Yes, this is a very important question because this is the time when people are most at risk for flu. When you get sick, you are likely to get sick with a fever and the flu can cause an infection. This is especially true for people who have a history of flu and who have been exposed to influenza virus.
What is the best way to help your patients recover from the flu?
What are the most effective ways to help patients recover after a flu? In the past few weeks, we have seen a number of people who had been hospitalized with influenza virus who were able to return home with a flu-like illness. These people are those who have had the flu for over a year and who are experiencing the symptoms of the flu.
The best way for people to recover from a flu that has occurred is to have a fever. If you have a mild flu, you can get a fever in

Expected Response: yes you can detect flu even if the patient doesn't have a fever in a lab setting. all you have to do is look for the virus.
================================================================================
Question: what cold medicine can i safely give to my 10-year-old child that is taking concerta?
Baseline Response: This is not a matter of "what cold medicine is right for you". If you are not prepared to give your child a cold medicine, then you should not give them a cold medical care. This is a medical emergency.

Expected Response: concerta is a prescription medication that is used to treat attention deficit disorder. as a general rule i would try to avoid nonprescription medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine as the active ingredient. taken with concerta these medications would likely increase your child’s heart rate or blood pressure. it is best to choose a cold medicine based on your symptoms. for a sore throat or other pain or fever a pain reliever/fever reducer such as acetaminophen is a good choice. for a runny nose or sneezing an antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine is the right option. pseudoephedrine is a choice to treat nasal or chest congestion. a “dry” or “hacking” cough may be eased by dextromethorphan and a “wet” or “productive” cough might respond to guaifenesin. without knowing your child’s specific symptoms it is hard to choose the right cold medicine for him. but hopefully some of this general information can be helpful. you can always talk to your local pharmacist for a more specific recommendation. and always let your pharmacist know about the medications that your child is taking as it is always important to check for interactions between prescription and nonprescription medications before use.
================================================================================
Question: does the medicine albuterol give a positive result on urine drug test. the only medication i take is what is prescribed by my doctor. i don't and never have taken any other drugs. so i was very surprised when i took a drug test for a new job and it came back positive for methamphetamens? a friend told me that albuterol( which i use in an inhaler and nebulizer) will cause that.
Baseline Response: i have never taken any medicine other than albutorol.

Expected Response: albuterol? not very likely but there are medications that could trigger a false response. <link>
================================================================================
Question: how is hypothyroidism treated?
Baseline Response: Hypothyroidists are treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
Hypothyroidist patients are given a placebo to relieve symptoms of hypothyrythemia. The patient is asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their health and be assessed for thyroid hormone. The doctor is then asked to assess the patient's thyroid hormone status.
The patient is then given a small dose of the thyroid hormone (usually 2.0 mg) once daily for a week.
This is followed by a monthly dose of thyroid hormone for 3 weeks.
After 3 weeks, the patient is referred to a doctor who will assess the treatment and determine if the treatment is safe.
If the patient does not respond to the first treatment, the doctor is told that hypothyronism is the most likely cause of hyponatremia.
It is not known how many patients are treated for hypothyrotestosterone, but the rate of hypox

Expected Response: doctors usually prescribe thyroid hormone pills to treat hypothyroidism. most people start to feel better within a week or two. your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. but you will likely need to keep taking the pills permanently. it's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. you will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems. if you have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism you may not need treatment now. but you'll want to watch closely for signs that it is getting worse.
================================================================================
Question: what can i do when life feels overwhelming?
Baseline Response: the only thing I can do is pray. If I am not praying, I am praying for the good of the world. I pray for all people, for the peace of God and for the strength of my soul.
If I am truly praying for God's love and the strength and strength of our souls, then I pray to God for the best for the future of our people and for their future.
I pray to pray for my brothers and sisters, my brothers, my sisters, for my sisters. I am going to pray to give my soul and body to the world and for my soul to have the strength to survive and to grow. I'm going to give it to my family and my friends, my family, my friends. I want to give back to the people of the planet.

Expected Response: because the many aspects of our lives are inter-related problems in one area often create difficulties in others too. for example a husband or wife losing a job generally puts a strain on their marriage. that strain can cause tension creating an emotional rift between them. if one of them has struggled with overeating alcoholism depression or poor anger management those issues are likely to return. and all of this can overflow into problem with children who live within this strained home environment. when this happens to you the most important first step (after realizing how overwhelmed you feel) is to really look at the ‘mountain. ’ what you will see upon closer inspection is that the mountain is not really one big weight. it is more like a pile of rocks. some of those rocks might be really heavy but they are each much more manageable than the mountain that you previously perceived. once you see your problems as a pile of rocks you can begin to sort them; from pebbles to boulders. tossing out the pebbles is relatively easy (is being five minutes late for work because of traffic really worth all that frustration? ). you can also move many of those rocks off of you (if talking to jane at work causes nothing but aggravation you can minimize your interactions with her. ). the result is that the mountain is no longer so big and unmovable. you will also begin to see how to move other rocks that didn’t seem to budge before. so for instance as you begin to lighten your load when your mother makes those critical comments that she so frequently tosses out you will begin to see them as her problem — not one you need to carry. you might still get upset but perhaps less so and you will be able to move past it more quickly.
================================================================================
Question: is mineral powder makeup better for you than liquid foundation makeup?
Baseline Response: yes, I have tried both. I use it on my face and it is very good. It helps to keep my skin looking fresh and healthy. I do not use it to apply foundation because I do want to feel my face better. It has helped me a lot to look more youthful, youthful and healthy in my skin. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to look youthful and look youthful in their skin.

Expected Response: i think having more choices is always better and i really like foundation makeup; whether it's liquid or powder or pressed powder for different skin types. so sometimes i have women come in who are using the wrong type of makeup and it can make their pores look bigger and the lines around their eyes look deeper. so you really have to play and try different things and see what works best for you. i don't think that one is better than the other for everybody but i think it's great to have lots of choices. if you want a more matte finish or if you have more oily skin mineral powder makeup may work better for you. if you have very dry skin you can still use that type of makeup but you should use a primer underneath to add some hydration to the skin before putting the power makeup over it.
================================================================================
Question: period like symptoms no period? or could i be pregnant. hi i've had for the last week. slight cramping on and off. sore breasts. milky white discharge over a week. period is 6 days late. it does feel like my period is coming but nothing. have had unprotected sex with partner. and have done test at 5 days late but negative
Baseline Response: Yes, i am pregnant.


I am a 21 year old college student, living in a small town. I am very worried about my health. I have been pregnant for a week and have been using a lot of medications. I think I will be having my period on or off for a month or two. I've had the flu and I am having a lot more anxiety. I can't remember the last time I had an unprotected sex. I feel like I am pregnant and I will have to go through this again. I do not want to have my period again.

.

,

Expected Response: no haven't seen the last doctor as of yet most they will say or probably do is a pee test and if negative wait a week to see if period comes then if nothing a blood test so ill probably just wait a week

Question: experiencing what i believe to be hives all over my stomach chest and sides as well as lower neck causing itchyness. started experiencing this about 4 days ago after returning from a road trip to nyc. while there i had some calamari at a restaurant other than that life was normal as usual. i been taking antihistamines and using hydro cortisone cream to stop itching. both treatments seem to be working with no prevail
Baseline Response: i feel that i am experiencing a condition called "Hive-like syndrome". i was given hydro cortisesone and i was able to tolerate them for a few days. i was unable to tolerate any of the other treatments. i felt that i had been treated with these medicines for over 2 months and i have had no problems with them. i feel it is the result of my own personal experiences and i am able to feel it. i am unsure if i am suffering from this disorder or if it is caused by my own body

Expected Response: it's can be tough diagnosing an itchy body. hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions. treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source. i had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walk-in medical clinic for professional help. my symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash. i though that i had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications. i also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms. obviously i was not contagious. in my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral ant-biotic that i had already taken for 5 days. since i had previously taken this same anti- biotic in the past without negative consequences and didn't immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime i mistakenly excluded the anti-biotic as my allergic source. in my case i was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed prednisone and directed to terminate the offending ant-biotic. in your case after 3-4 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines it's probably time to see a doctor.
================================================================================
Question: what is hypotension?
Baseline Response: The hypotension of a dog is about the circumference of a human foot, and a dog's hypotension is about 3.5mm.
The hypotension for a human is 2.5, or 1.5.
For example, a dog with hypotension 2.8 is hypotensive, and his hypotension 3.0 is hypotoxic.
A dog with an extremely low hypotension (1.5) is hypotemic, and he is also hypotensive.
So hypotension in a dog should be about the diameter of a man's waist.
When we look at hypotension, we see that the hypotension around the head of a cat is about 2.25mm. In a dog, the hypotensive hypotension about the head is about 1.25.
But the hypotenic hypotension that a human has is about 0.4mm. So the hypothetic hypotension we see is about 4.

Expected Response: hypotension means low blood pressure.
================================================================================
Question: my period is 6 days late i started spotting this pinkish color along with this red like slime coming out. what is wrong? . my period is never late. abdominal cramping. nausea. are all symptoms i have.
Baseline Response: my uterus is a little small. it's not like you're trying to get rid of the problem. you're just trying to keep your period. the problem is getting more and more frequent. the only way to get around this problem is to get your period in order. if you're in pain, try to relax and get some rest. if your period is in an irregular shape, it may be due to a bad pregnancy. you might need to get a CT scan to see if your ovaries are in a normal state. the biggest problem is that you may be pregnant and don't have the right hormones. your doctor might recommend a hormone replacement.

Expected Response: you may be pregnant! i've been reading a lot since i am 3 days late and it sounds like it could be implantation bleeding which is usually very light pink or spotting (some people describe it as a light period and/or shorter period than normal). you can test since you're almost a week late. mine are all coming out negative but i feel pregnant. good luck!

Question: i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.
Baseline Response: i feel the cold and then my skin starts to heat up. this is not an actual fever but a cold feeling, i have a cold with cold skin and i just feel as if my body is heating up. i have been told that i am getting colds but i am not sure how. i am pretty sure i am cold but i think it is because my skin has been getting hot and my skin's temperature is very low. i feel like my body has been heating up and i am only getting a

Expected Response: i've had this same feeling of hot skin and feeling flush for over 10 years now but i do not have a fever. i've tried several different vitamins and herbs but what i've come to realize is that the reason i'm feeling this way is because i'm not hydrated enough. i know you think that this couldn't be what is causing this for you but i would encourage you to drink two or three bottles of cold water when this hot feeling starts to come on and then see how this makes you feel 15 to 20 min later. i know this seems too simple to be the solution but it's worth a try. it has certainly been the solution for me. i'm a 45 male. i do have low testosterone and get weekly injections for this. i spend 95% of my time inside a cool 70 degree house so i shouldn't be dehydrated but this has been my solution. maybe i'm not dehydrated but for whatever reason this works for me. best of luck in finding how to solve this issue in your body. i know how frustrating it can be to feel this way and not know what to do or even try. best of health to you! scott

================================================================================
Question: what are the treatments for pneumonia?
Baseline Response: The diagnosis of pneumonia is a difficult one. The primary care physician must determine whether the patient has an underlying illness or is suffering from other causes. The patient's health care provider can help by providing treatment and resources to the patient and other health care providers.
Pneumonia is not a serious illness. The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe.
What is pneumonia? The term "pneumonia" is derived from the Latin, "pile," which means "to die" or "to become sick." In many parts of the world, pneumonia is the most common cause of death among people who are in a state of acute illness. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, fever and other symptoms of acute respiratory distress.
The symptoms of a person with a severe respiratory illness include:

sudden, severe abdominal pain

pain in the upper respiratory tract

Expected Response: can pneumonia cause an osteoarthritis flair up?
================================================================================
Question: how is dry mouth treated?
Baseline Response: dry mouth is a condition where you can't taste the air.
Solution: dry mouths is a form of throat cancer, and it's not a bad thing. It's a bad sign if you have it.
It's also a sign of other things, such as a problem with your lungs.
Do you have a problem at all with your mouth?
It depends. There are some people who have it, others who don't.
You don't have to worry about it. It can be a symptom of a condition called asthma.
Are there any things you can do to get rid of dry mouth? (Read on to find out what you can, and what you don't know about it)
The good news is, you don' need to.
The bad news is that you'll have to. It depends on how you want to act.
What you need to do is to give up dry mouth

Expected Response: if you think your dry mouth is caused by certain medication you are taking talk to your doctor. he or she may adjust the dose you are taking or switch you to a different drug that doesn't cause dry mouth. in addition an oral rinse to restore mouth moisture may be prescribed. if that doesn't help a medication that stimulates saliva production called salagen may be prescribed. other steps you can take that may help improve saliva flow include: sucking on sugar-free candy or chewing sugar-free gum drinking plenty of water to help keep your mouth moist protecting your teeth by brushing with a fluoride toothpaste using a fluoride rinse and visiting your dentist regularly breathing through your nose not your mouth as much as possible using a room vaporizer to add moisture to the bedroom air using an over-the-counter artificial saliva substitute.

Baseline Response: if i have a second miscarriage, I have to take the new pill and it's on my third pill
Answer to question: i'm on birthcontrol and i was worried i could lose it and i knew my body could not handle it so i was afraid i could

Expected Response: oral contraceptives are very effective at preventing pregnancy. if you have been taking your pill daily as directed then you should not become pregnant. you should not take any extra pills as this will affect your cycle and will not decrease your chances of becoming pregnant. you should continue to take one pill a day.
================================================================================
Question: how can i help myself if i have bipolar disorder?
Baseline Response: If you have bipolar illness, you can get help from your doctor or psychiatrist.
What is the Treatment?
How to help:
1. Take a few minutes to talk with your doctor. Ask them about the symptoms.
2. Talk about the problem.
3. Ask about the treatment.
4. Ask questions about the medication.
5. Ask your doctor about the medications.

8. Ask if the medication is effective and if so, how much.
9. Ask the doctor how long it takes to get the medication out of the body.
10. Ask how long the medication takes to be able to take the medication in the body and how long that takes.
11. If

Expected Response: it may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. it may take time but you can get better with treatment. to help yourself: talk to your doctor about treatment options and progress. keep a regular routine such as eating meals at the same time every day and going to sleep at the same time every night. try to get enough sleep. stay on your medication. learn about warning signs signaling a shift into depression or mania. expect your symptoms to improve gradually not immediately.

Expected Response: most medications are good for about a year after you get them from the pharmacy that is if they are stored properly away from direct heat or light and in a cool dry place. i do not recommend keeping medication longer than a year because passing time increases the likelihood that mistakes can be made while taking it. if you haven’t used the lorazapam in years most likely you don't need it. so i would recommend discarding it. the best way to dispose of medication is through a local drug take-back program. or mix the pills with an undesirable substance -- like kitty litter or used coffee grounds -- wrap it all up and throw it away. flushing medications down the toilet is not recommended.

Question: can bacon be part of a healthy diet?
Baseline Response: Yes, bacon is a source of protein and has been found to be a beneficial dietary source of fat.
However, it is not recommended for consumption on a regular basis.
If you are unsure about your health status, check with your doctor.
For more information on health risks and benefits of bacon, see:
1. What is bacon?
2. How is it produced?
3. How are it made?
4. How does it work?
5. How can it be made?


How to make bacon:


1) Remove bacon from the refrigerator.

2) Place it in a bowl and add a tablespoon of water.



3) Add some of the bacon to a frying pan.


4) Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until bacon is cooked through.
.
 (You can use a spoon to gently add the bacon.)

Expected Response: in very small quantities bacon isn't bad for your diet. but it might increase your risk of heart disease stroke and cancer. first 68% of bacon's calories come from fat almost half of which is saturated. each ounce of bacon contributes 30 milligrams of cholesterol. bacon is also a processed meat which is not considered safe to eat according to the american institute for cancer research. (processed meat is usually red meat preserved via smoking curing or salting that contains nitrates a carcinogen. ) regular consumption of processed meats may lead to higher risk for prostate cancer and several other cancers. if you have to eat bacon one ounce should be enough. even with the highest-fat type of bacon one ounce adds up to 140 calories (the same as one cup of low-fat milk or two small slices of whole wheat bread). choose a slightly leaner type such as oscar mayer center cut smokehouse thick sliced and one ounce adds up to 105 calories and 7. 5 grams of fat. don't make bacon a daily indulgence. when you do treat yourself keep the serving size small and include antioxidant-rich fruits or vegetables in the meal whenever possible.

Question: is it safe to take oxyelite pro while taking oral contraceptives?
Baseline Response: yes and no.
If you are a female, it is best to take oral contraceptives in a pill form, such as a pill containing oxyelitrite.
(Source: www.nepd.nih.gov/~dannle/research/publications/pharmacy/pharmacology/phylogenetics/phyllogen

Expected Response: while there are no known interactions between this supplement and oral contraceptives i cannot say for sure if it is safe. as a pharmacist i never recommend weight loss supplements. many have dangerous side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure (which could be dangerous for someone on birth control pills) and have been found to contain dangerous ingredients. these supplements are not regulated the same way as drugs that are approved by the fda. we can never really know for sure what is in these supplements. so i cannot tell you with any certainty about the possible interactions.

Question: is pregnancy considered a "medical condition? "
Baseline Response: Yes, it is.
In fact, it's quite true.
The medical condition is a medical condition, not a medical problem.
It's a medical case, not an abortion case.
If you're pregnant, you have a medical health problem. You're not a pregnant person.
You're not pregnant.
And if you are, you're not healthy.
So, when it comes to medical conditions, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
I'm not saying that you shouldn't be pregnant, but it's not a 'medical condition' to say you should be pregnant. It's not an 'abortion condition' at all.
No, it matters what you do.
As long as you're healthy, you can go ahead and do it.
When it comes time to decide whether or not to have an abortion, there are two things that come to mind:
If

Expected Response: this is one question that will likely generate multiple answers with differing positions. it is also likely that no one answer will satisfy all viewers as being totally accurate. a medical condition is sometimes defined as an injury disease or disorder. based upon that definition pregnancy does not appear to be a "medical condition". but others will argue that pregnancy can result in medical complications injury or other disorders and therefore may sometimes be a medical condition. here is an interesting note. in at least one state undocumented aliens had not been not been as a rule eligible for medicaid benefits. but the delivery of the baby from a undocumented alien was considered a "medical emergency" and qualified for medicaid coverage. it really comes down to our own feelings on the subject. many would suggest that pregnancy is a natural act and not a medical condition; others would steadfastly hold to the belief that all pregnant woman require medical monitoring and delivery treatment and therefore pregnancy is a medical condition.

Question: can hpv cause false positive hepatitis test
Baseline Response: The hepatitis test is not necessary for false positive tests because of the absence of a positive hepatitis. The test will only be done if the test is positive. If the test shows an abnormal liver function, then the test will be called.
Example:
Example 1:
Note: If you have hepatitis C, the test would be called on the following day. Example 2:
If you have liver failure, the hepatitis test would not be called if the liver failed on the day the test was called. The results of the test are not required for a false positive.
A hepatitis test has a positive value that is not required by law. Therefore, a test that shows liver failure may be called when a person is in a state of high risk for hepatitis C infection. The liver test results should be considered if the person is a person with an abnormal or unexplained liver function.
If the test results are not provided,

Expected Response: no but i do not know what kind of hepatitis test you are talking about. there are many different strains of hpv that can cause a variety of human afflictions. there are also many different types of hepatitis. a person can have both hepatitis and hpv.

Question: is it possible to be allergic to sperm?
Baseline Response: yes. If you are allergic to semen, it is possible to become allergic to the sperm.
There are two kinds of allergic reactions to sperm. The first type of allergic reaction is known as anaphylaxis. The second kind of allergic response is called perinatal allergic reaction.
Aperinatal allergy is a condition that is caused by a genetic defect in the egg. It is the result of a sperm defect in a fertilized egg that causes an allergic reaction in the fetus. The sperm in the fertilized baby is then left to live in the environment where they are not allowed to reproduce.
The fertilized sperm are then exposed to the environment and are exposed to a toxic environment. This exposure causes anaphyositis, an allergic response in which the sperm is exposed to toxic chemicals. This is a problem that can be life-threatening if untreated.
In pregnancy, the sperm are exposed at

Expected Response: although rare some people develop an allergy to seminal fluid. this can lead to local irritation and/or systemic symptoms. some medical centers are able to perform a desensitization procedure if seminal fluid allergy is diagnosed. the procedure is a type of desensitization therapy similiar to allergy shots for pollen allergy.

Question: can you get strep throat from someone who doesn't have strep throat?
Baseline Response: no, you need to be careful not to get streptococcal from someone with strep-specific strep.
You can also get streptic from someone without strep, but that is a different matter.
This is a very common infection. It can also happen to people with psoriasis, psorism, or other psoristatic diseases.
How do I get strepsis?
You need to get the most out of your strep virus infection.
A person with streptosis may have a few symptoms, which can include:
Swelling (bruising of the eyes, redness of the mouth, loss of appetite, etc.)
Fever (paresthesia, or fever)
Coughing (diarrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, etc)
Trouble breathing (stomach

Expected Response: technically no but if the person was a strep carrier (an individual that has strep bacteria colonized in their throat but is not having any symptoms) one can be exposed. studies have shown that around 10% of the population may be symptom-free strep carriers.

Question: diagnosed with genital herpes a month back sores have healed but continued vaginal irritation/itching for weeks after. i thought it was caused by a yeast infection cuz i got a white discharge cottage cheese-like in texture for two days along with the itching. but now there is no discharge so i think the yeast infection might have cleared but now i feel a reccurrent outbreak of herpes coming on and again itching in the vaginal area but no discharge. is it normal for the new skin after the primary outbreak to be itchy? if so could any topical medicine help with that?
Baseline Response: not sure what treatment will help. if it helps, I would recommend a lot of it. if not, it is a little scary but it is very easy to treat with a topical medication like Viagra.
I know that it is possible to treat genital herpes but it takes time for it to clear up and a lot more research needs to be done on it.

Question: which doctor should i go to for boils. i have recurring boils in different places. i have a fairly large one now that s draining slowly. should i see a dermatologist or primary care doctor. also i am diabetic. help please
Baseline Response: The following are the reasons why you should not go to a dermatology or primary health care provider:
1) you might be sick of the cold.
2) you are allergic to water.
3) you have severe allergic reactions to a substance.
4) you need to be vaccinated.
5) you do not want to be treated with antibiotics.
6) you feel ill and do not know how to talk to your doctor.
7) your doctor is not in a position to help you.
8) you could have an allergic reaction.
Answer, if you are sick of colds or colds that are not related to colds, you should seek emergency medical attention or consult a dermatologists doctor

Expected Response: either one is fine assuming your primary care doctor is comfortable in lancing these things and taking a wound culture to identify the "bug" (usually staph). because you are a diabetic you may be more prone to these things and more prone to infections that can get out of hand so please do not delay getting treatment.

Question: how much of an impact does vitamin d have on cardiovascular disease?
Baseline Response: Dihydroxyvitamin D (DVD) is an important component of your vitamin D profile. DVD is a very low risk of cardiovascular disease. Dihyterolic acid (DHEA), the main component of the vitamin D diet, is also a significant contributor.
In a study in the United Kingdom, the average daily intake of DHEA was 30 g, and vitamin D was found to be 1.1 mg/day. This is the same as a daily intake (40 g) of vitamin D (1.0 mg/d) for adults and 40 g of vitamin E (2.0 g/d).
In fact, the vitamin E intake is estimated to be 20 mg/wk for men and 30 mg/month for women, which is approximately the same intake as for vitamin D.
The average daily vitamin D intake is only around 15 mg/

Expected Response: in finland a 25- to 30-year study of over 6 000 persons found an increased risk of fatal vascular disease in those who had the lowest blood levels of 25(oh)d. interestingly this relationship was apparent for the incidence of strokes but not heart attacks. proposed mechanisms for improved blood vessel health include vitamin d's beneficial impact on high blood pressure via kidney hormones decreased inflammation inside the arteries and improved insulin resistance via changes in parathyroid hormone (lee 200<positive_smiley>.

Question: i bought some cheap lip gloss now my lips have little bumps and are peeling. why?
Baseline Response: because they are too thick and they are so thick. i just bought some lip gloss and it's a little hard to see the difference. the texture is great. the color is just the same as the base color and the colors are pretty similar.
Answer
Answer : the colors have a different feel from the base. the base is very smooth, the lip gloss is a bit too smooth and the lip shine is very hard to discern.
If you want to try the color you can buy a few different shades that you can get at the store.

Expected Response: you may just be having an allergic or adverse reaction to the cheap lip gloss. throw it away and allow your lips to heal. you can go back to a prior lip gloss that did not cause issues. a little 1% hydrocortisone ointment on your lips will help the healing process.

Question: could my pinky be broken or just sprained like the er doctor said it was? . the day before yesterday i fell and hit my head on a table and i landed on my pinky it swelled up and started turning black about 3 minutes after i fell my mom took me to the er and they x-ray'd it and said it was just sprained but they didn't x-ray where i said it hurt it's hurting in the palm of my hand and it's still swelling the er put me in a finger splint which is not helping the pain at all. could my finger be broken and the doctor just didn't see anything?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure.
Answer 2: No.
There are a lot of things that can cause a bruise, but I'm sure you could go back and look at the pictures. The first is the pain. The second is the swelling. The third is the bruise.
Solution: The pain

Expected Response: yes your finger could be broken if the x-rays did not clearly show your finger. the palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the x-ray viewed this area as well or you may need another film. sprains do not show up on x-rays. just bones. since i can't examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping.

Question: how can i push my depressed spouse into being more involved and helpful?

I have a new treatment called Heartburn Relief, and it's a great way to get some relief from heartburn. It's a low-carb, low-fat, low carb meal that's high in fiber

Expected Response: the key to enjoying cookouts is to know what foods agree with you. if grease bothers you stick with grilled foods or vegetables. instead of tomatoes load up your salads with carrots beans jicama or other milder veggies. burgers are ok but get the leanest cuts and dress them with guacamole or something else less acidic than catsup. if carbonated drinks lead to late-night torture stick with iced tea. if margaritas and you don't get along drink less or switch to a virgin strawberry type. watermelon can be acid-producing. consign it to a mixed-fruit salad only. eat smaller portions. your stomach detects large amounts and pumps out more acid.

================================================================================
Question: what causes diarrhea?
Baseline Response: it's because of the protein in the water that causes it. When you get diarrhea, your body has a lot of proteins in it. So you have a lot more protein in your body than it would otherwise be. When it gets into your intestines, it's a lot less protein.
What you'll see in your diarrhea is a lot larger, more complicated protein structures. If you are on a diet that contains lots of protein, then you'll have a higher protein load, and you'll also have a lower protein load. The more protein you have, the more protein your body is able to use.
So if you're on a high protein diet, then your body will use less protein and you will have a greater protein load because of that. So, that's the main thing that you're going to see.
How to Stop It?
Well, there are a lot things that you can do to stop it.

Expected Response: you are most likely to come down with diarrhea after coming into contact with these infectious organisms and agents: a virus such as rotavirus norwalk agent enterovirus or a hepatitis virus. a bacterium such as e. coli salmonella shigella clostridium or vibrio cholerae. a parasite such as those that cause giardiasis and amebiasis. you may pick up an infectious agent from contact with another individual who has it or you may get it after eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. if you eat food that was improperly cooked or was contaminated after cooking you may get food poisoning which can lead to diarrhea. children who attend day care and their families are more likely to be exposed to certain infectious agents. many people who travel to foreign countries develop what is termed "traveler's diarrhea " usually after drinking contaminated water. infectious diarrhea is a particular hazard in developing countries where it may be difficult to keep waste water and sewage separate from water used for cooking drinking and bathing and where inadequate facilities make it difficult to practice good personal hygiene. other medical conditions a number of noninfectious medical conditions may cause diarrhea too. these include: inability to digest certain foods including a lactose intolerance (difficulty digesting sugar found in dairy products); celiac disease (inability to digest wheat and sometimes other grains); and pancreatic problems such as those caused by cystic fibrosis which interfere with production of important digestive substances. surgery to remove part of your small intestine. a shortened small intestine may be unable to absorb all the substances you eat. this is referred to as short-bowel syndrome. surgery after removal of the gallbladder. an increase in bile in the colon may result in watery stools. certain diseases of the endocrine (hormonal) system including overactive thyroid disease diabetes adrenal disease and zollinger-ellison syndrome. certain rare tumors (including carcinoid tumor and pheochromocytoma) that produce diarrhea-causing substances (hormones). inflammation in the intestinal tract which can result in chronic diarrhea. if you have inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease) you will have regular bouts of diarrhea during a flare-up of your disease. sometimes people who develop bumps in their intestine from diverticulitis also get diarrhea. irritable bowel syndrome which may cause alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation. medications and other substances many medications can cause diarrhea. some of the most common include antacids containing magnesium laxatives digitalis diuretics a number of antibiotics chemotherapy drugs cholesterol-lowering agents lithium theophylline thyroid hormone and colchicine. radiation therapy for prostate cancer or cancers in the abdomen can damage the intestine and cause diarrhea. toxins such as insecticides psychedelic mushrooms and arsenic can cause diarrhea and overuse of caffeine or alcohol may contribute to diarrhea.

Question: will melatonin supplements work on patients with hypothyroidism?
Baseline Response: yes. Melatonin is an essential nutrient in the body. It is important to consider that a person with hypogonadism has low levels of melatonin, but may have high levels of other nutrients.
Melatonin is a chemical that is found in the skin and is found naturally in the food we eat. Melamine is found throughout the body, and is naturally found in our skin. It can be found in many things, from the food you eat to the foods you drink. It also contains a very high concentration of the amino acids tyrosine and glutamine.
A small amount of melamine is needed to produce the body's melatonin.
As you have probably guessed, there is a lot of melaze in the foods we eat, and that is why we call it melatonin!
Melamine is a precursor to melatonin and its effects on the body are dependent on

Expected Response: melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states " it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. " i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin.

Question: i cut a chuck out of my finger with a peeler. i did get it to quit bleeding but how do i care for it now?
Baseline Response: the cut is completely free of any debris. it's not going to get stuck in your fingers.


The best way to get it off is to use a toothbrush and a clean toothbrush with a clean tap and wipe away any debris that comes off the handle. i don't recommend using a toothpick because it will cause the handle to fall off and the toothbrush will be too heavy to do anything with. i also don't think that if you do it right the cut will be completely free from any debris, so if you have a tooth brush and a toothpaste you can get it away from your fingers and you can use it for cleaning your teeth.

If you're using a razor or a sharpie you can still get it out of your fingers, but this is a great way to remove any

Expected Response: obviously without the ability to examine your finger to determine the significance of this "chunk" that you have i can only offer you some general information. most of these avulsion injuries will heal over time. they will scab over and gradually. new skin will form over this area. larger "chunks" may require stitches to close. since i cannot see your injury you will need to make a judgment about seeking hands-on medical care. keep the wound clean to prevent infection. use a topical antibiotic ointment and keep in covered with a bandage until a scab forms.

Expected Response: your head won't explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you. if it hurts. don't do it. a suggestion. decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight. in other words lower the intensity of your work-out at least for power-lifting until you feel better.

Question: my 2 year-old wants to be picked up very often. should i pick him up when he requests this? . my son just turned 2 last month. he is in daycare during the week and when he is home with mom & dad he very often wants "up". then he often wants mom or dad to go "this way" or "that way". am i doing harm by indulging him by picking him up upon his request to be picked up often. i want to be affectionate but i am afraid this is not good for him in the long-run.
Baseline Response: I am a woman who does not like children. I think there is a reason why we don't have the right to pick up children at the same time. I am sure that I would be very upset if I were to pick my son up and that he would be so upset that he will not want to go home. I would not want my son to go to a school that is

Expected Response: just pick him up. he may need a bit of extra affection that he is not getting in day-care. when you are holding him he feels that you will not go away. after a few minutes just put him down and play with him as a distraction. this will eventually stop. you don't see parents carrying older kids around in most cases.

Question: i need to find generics to treat my asthma and high blood pressure. i have medicare advantage insurance. what can i try?
Baseline Response: i would recommend generics. you can use a pharmacy for your medicine. a pharmacy is a hospital, it is a doctor's office, it has a doctor who will check your medicine and treat it. a pharmacist is a person who will give you a prescription. a doctor is a nurse who will help you get the medicine to your doctor. a nurse is a medical assistant who will make sure you are getting the right medicine.

Expected Response: this is a common question i get at the pharmacy. the first thing i ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications. if your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice. if you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs. many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting merck and astrazeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on.

Question: in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?
Baseline Response: it depends on the type of egg you are buying. Most are good for a few days but some are bad and some are good enough to keep your heart healthy.
Answer #3: the egg whites don't help with heart disease, high cholesterol, or diabetes. They are the best option for you.

Expected Response: the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg whites more often should not increase the risk for heart disease. the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg white more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.

Answer 1: i think i got a little sore and the swelling came out. i had a couple of days to heal but i never felt any more sore. i dont have any pain in my dick and i dont feel any pain that i would have if i had not gotten my nipples.

Question: is it possible to get pregnant from sharing a bathroom with somebody? . i'm 14 years old and i've skipped my period recently. this has happened before due to stress or anxiety but this time it's different. i've noticed my stomach is kind of bloated and it feels hard when i poke or feel it. i obviously have not had sex. like none at all. because that's illegal. anyways i share a bathroom with my dad and this is the weird part i'm just afraid sperm could get in a towel or on a toilet seat or something like that.
Baseline Response: i don't have a problem with it. and i'm not the only one. but i've seen a few women who have had sex with men who share a toilet with them. so i think that the issue is different. if you're a woman who doesn't have sex with someone who shares a toilet, i'd be surprised if you get pregnant. if i'm having a problem in any way

Expected Response: hi yes stress and anxiety will stop periods and so will your hormones exercise or trying to loss weight but also at 14 it often happens when your periods just stop could be for 6 months then restart it just happens to young women. as for sperm on towels if you don't trust your father try having your own towel and keep it in your room as for the toilet seat i do not ever recall a women getting pregnant that way most women get pregnant from full penetrating sex but next time just wipe the toilet seat. hope this helps you. good luck

Baseline Response: yes, i am pregnant.
Answer 2: i feel I am pregnant and i feel like i am ready for my period.

Expected Response: okay this has happened to me before and trust me its most likely that you are just making yourself worried. if you are getting your period any day now then youre not even technically late yet. what signs of pregnancy? because nausea food cravings/different food tastes/favorite foods making you sick dizziness mood swings lower back pain chest pain tiredness are all common period symptoms. its probably just pms. and you wouldnt feel like you were about to start your period if you were pregnant. you wouldnt even have minor cramps. until you are significantly late dont worry. and if after a week of not having your period just take a pregnancy test. simple. you may feel panicked right now but dont get ahead of yourself. just wait it out.

Question: i'm the only family member who got a flu shot and i have the flu and they don't. what could explain this?
Baseline Response: i don't know. i was on the train at my house and i saw a guy with a flu and i thought i saw someone with the flu. i saw him and he said, "Hello, your doctor is here, and I'm going to try to help you." so i called the flu medics and they said, this is my doctor. he said that he has a flu. so i went to the doctor and i asked for a shot. he told me that my doctor has been diagnosed with the virus and that he wants to take it. so I went to my doctor and he told my doctor that he is going to need to take my shot because my doctor says that he needs to take the flu shot. so he told the doctor that i'm going through the flu phase, and i said, i'm not sure

Expected Response: most helpful answer every person is different. the flu shot is not 100% protective -- many of my patients who got the flu vaccine this year developed a mutating strain of the flu. and influenza is often misdiagnosed so did you have a lab test to prove you have influenza? per the question below the doctor took a nasal swab; the result said i had influenza type a.

Question: does boiling turkey franks reduce fat and calories? . does boiling turkey franks reduce sodium fat calories and change nutritional values?
Baseline Response: Yes, there is a lot of research on the effects of boiling turkey jerky on the body. But we don't know how much of the body fat is lost, and how much is lost in the process. It's possible that cooking turkey jerks with salt may cause some of the fat to leak into the fat cells, which in turn may cause weight gain.
If you're concerned about the health effects of cooking turkey frank jerky, we recommend using a thermometer to determine if your turkey is still cooking.
The best way to determine whether your turkey has reached its desired temperature is to measure the amount of salt you add to it. You can use a thermograph to measure how much salt you added to your turkey before and after cooking. If you don't have a thermometers, it's better to just go to the

Expected Response: not enough to make a difference. some fat (with a few calories) will end up in the cooking water but not a significant amount. compared to regular franks turkey franks already have less fat.

Question: what do i do for a certain gender pregnancy
Baseline Response: I do a lot of things for a specific gender pregnancy. I do things like try to get pregnant, get pregnant with a baby and then make a baby. I also do things to try to have a pregnancy before I give birth.
What I am doing for a particular gender pregnancy is really just doing things to get a certain kind of pregnancy.
I am trying to get my baby in a position where I can make the baby.
Do I need to make a big deal out of it?
I don't need to talk about it, just to be able to make the pregnancy happen.
If you need to ask me, I can give you a specific answer.
For example, if you want to make sure I get pregnant when I give a baby to you, you can ask me what kind of baby I am.
You can also ask me to make an appointment, just because I want to know

Expected Response: hi if you thinking boy or girl? yes will you find by doing lots of reading on it its just down to male sperm it dictates what you will get. but look around your find lots of old wives tales on what you can do for a girl or boy. good luck ps end of the day its pot luck.

Question: will taking cephalexin interfere with birth control?
Baseline Response: if the cephaler does not have a cephatecologist, they can take the cephalogen in the vaginal canal and have it removed from the vagina. It is very common to have a pregnancy that occurs in the first trimester, as the vaginal birth canal is at the very beginning of the second trimester. The vaginal birth tube is very important for the cesarean section and also the delivery.
The cephalogen is injected into the vagina through the vagina, and the vaginal delivery is carried out by the cingulum, which is the vaginal opening of the vaginal cavity.
There are many ways to take cephalesa from the vaginal tube, and some are better than others.
This is the most common way to take the vaginal cephalid.
How much cephaledric is used
In some cases, the ciliary blood is used to

Expected Response: no. there is no evidence that cephalexin will affect birth control pills. it is a common belief that all antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of birth control pills though that is not always the case. missing a dose of your birth control pill or vomiting or diarrhea from your antibiotic may affect your hormone level. these reactions could affect the efficacy of your pills. talk to your pharmacist about any of your concerns regarding drug interactions. they can help.

Baseline Response: i have been diagnosed with advanced hepatic cirrhotic disease. i have never seen a doctor who is 100% sure that i am going to be cured. he has seen a few doctors who are 100% confident and are going to treat me. he is the only person i know who knows if i will be cured as i am 100% certain that i will not die from this disease. he will take my medicines and I will be happy and healthy.


I hope you will help me find out if you will be able to help me with my medical bills.

Question: is there a generic for cymbalta?
Baseline Response: The generic for the cymbal is [2].
The main thing to note is that there are two types of cymbals. The first is the generic for "mesh" (the root of the cymbol) and the second is the type of cymbol (the name of the name of a cymbol).
The "mitch" is the name for the mesh symbol. The mitch symbol is the first character of the mish symbol (the form of the symbol in the form of a mish).
Mitch is the root of a number of other words, but it's important to note that the "mish" does not mean "mash", but rather "mush" (or mosh, for short).
What is the definition of the word "mosh"?
The definition of mosh is "to make one of two things."
Here's what

Expected Response: cymbalta is not available as a generic. prior to making a recommendation to your health care provider i would ask for what reason are you taking cymbalta. depending on your condition you might consider asking your health care provider to prescribe you a drug within the same class as cymbalta that has a generic version. thanks for the question.

Question: i am taking ampicillin for a uti. i am worried it isn't treating it. how long should it take to feel no symptoms? . i was diagnosed with a uti. the doctor put me on cipro but due to previous issues with utis and kidney infections i asked them to culture my sample. a week later they called to tell me the bacteria in my urine was b streptococcus. i still had symptoms so they placed me on ampicillin which i have now been taking for 5 days. i still have symptoms and only 2 more days on the antibiotic. do i need to worry that it isn't being treated? should i call for a new antibiotic?
Baseline Response: no. I have not been prescribed antibiotics for a while and it is a long time before i get the chance to take them.
Answer to question: yes.

Expected Response: have the urine re-cultured after you are off the ampicillin. you may need to be examined to look for other possible causes to account for your continuing symptoms and definitely get examined if you are having any back (kidney area) pain.
================================================================================
Question: how is anemia caused by decreased red blood cell production treated?
Baseline Response: anemia is a condition that affects the amount of red blood cells that are able to be produced by the body. Anemia is caused by a deficiency of red cells, which can cause the body to produce more red blood.
Red blood cells are a component of the blood cells. Red blood cells can be produced from the blood, but they are not able to produce the blood itself. Red cells can't be produced in a specific way.
When the blood of anemia occurs in a particular area of the body, it is called a hemoglobin. The blood is converted into hemoglobin and stored in the body's blood-brain barrier, which is a vessel that allows the body oxygen to flow through the blood. The body then releases the hemoglobin to make up for lost oxygen.
In the case of anemic red blood, the hemobutting process can be initiated by the patient.

Expected Response: the type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production. with iron deficiency anemia your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron which your body can absorb easily. timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. if you use iron supplements remember the following cautions: * always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. excess iron intake can be harmful. symptoms of iron overload include fatigue vomiting diarrhea headache irritability heart disease and joint problems. * iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children. iron poisoning is the most common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. eating even a few tablets can prove fatal in a matter of hours. symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness confusion nausea vomiting and diarrhea. seek medical help immediately. * watch for side effects. you may need to continue taking iron supplements for up to one year. taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects which may include nausea diarrhea constipation and stomach pain. let your doctor know if you continue to have side effects. different formulations are available. * watch for drug interactions. tell your doctor if you are being treated for another condition. for example calcium supplements interfere with iron absorption so it is best to take them at different times of the day. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. good dietary sources of iron include red meat beans egg yolk whole-grain products nuts and seafood. many processed foods and milk are also reinforced with iron. your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts including hematocrit hemoglobin and ferritin levels during treatment. if your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. in rare cases your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). in extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia treatment may involve a blood transfusion

Question: infant runny bowel movements. my 2 month old son has had very runny bowel movements since birth. we have checked with his doctor changed his formula and still have had no changes. his bm's most often happen before he has even finished a. 5-6 oz. bottle. he also grunts a lot as if constipated. wehave gotten no answers from out dr and are very concerned.
Baseline Response: This baby is about the size of a kitten and has a very large bowel movement. we are trying to get a picture of what's going on.


Answer 2: We have an infant that has a runny stool that is quite hard to remove and we are worried about him getting sick. we don't have any answers as to what he has done with his bp's.

Answer 3: I am still concerned about the baby. We are not sure what to do as he has runny on his own but we are now looking at

Expected Response: two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!

Question: can osteoarthritis in back cause pain in my lft gluteal muscle into hip joint down frnt thigh and not be able to walk? . i frequently have the pain in my gluteal muscle and the pain in my hip joint. after too much house work or shopping the pain gets really bad in my hip into the side and front of my thigh. it has gotten severe enough that i can not lift my leg to walk. after sitting a while i can walk again but it comes back. ice relives the pain and after about a week of using ice sometimes over-night pain in my thigh leaves. can arthritis cause these issues?
Baseline Response: yes. osteoarthropathy (bone loss) is a common cause of pain and inflammation in the joints. The more the joints are affected by the joint disease, the more likely it is that the joint is affected by osteo-arthritis. This is especially true of the back. In a recent study

Expected Response: i had the same type of pain. my doctor said the femoral nerve was being compressed in my back and sent me for therapy. i was very doubtful about this but after a few weeks of therapy the pain disappeared. the main exercise was: stand a few inches from a wall place hands flat on the wall at chest level. press the lower body forward a few inches repeat 30 times 2 or 3 times a day. don't over-extend just press forward as long as it is comfortable.

Question: what is implantable contraception?
Baseline Response: a combination of implants, which are used to make a man's penis grow larger than the size of his thumb, and a small, non-laser implant.
Answer 1: implantable, nonlaser, or implantable
Answer 2: implantible, nonlinear, or nonlinear
Answer 3: implantability, non linear, or linear
Answer 4: implantation, non linearly linear
Why are they called implantable?
A good answer is that the term "semi-linear implantable" is used to refer to the fact that a man can have a penis that is not as large as the size he was born with. The term is also used to describe the fact of the implantation of a penis, as the penis is not "as large as" the size it was conceived of.
What is the difference between a "semitable implantable penis" and a "nonlinear implant

Expected Response: a single rod containing progestin that is implanted by your doctor under the skin. it is effective for up to 3 years and can be removed earlier. you can find more information from the american society for reproductive medicine on this topic here: <link> it's a form of birth control that should protects against pregnancy for up to 3 years. the implant which looks like a rod is about the size of a matchstick and is implanted under the skin by your doctor. it's easily removable by your doctor when you want to plan a pregnancy and fertilty returns to normal without any delay. like all forms of contraception there are side effects that you should consider such as weight gain irregular bleeding acne mood changes and headache. this method is considered nearly 100% effective with less than one pregnancy occurring for every one hundred women using an implant for a year. it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. however you can reduce your risk by using a latex condom every time you have vaginal oral or anal sex.

Question: mom has extreme fatigue and abdominal pain. she's been to the doctor and her illness remains undiagnosed. suggestions?
Baseline Response: she is an average sized person. she has very low blood pressure and high cholesterol and she is also very obese. she is very sensitive to light and smells. she doesn't eat too much, but she has a high cholesterol level. she needs daily rest to maintain her health. her health is improving. she will be taking a lot of aspirin. she does not drink much. she also has a problem with blood sugar control and weight loss. she says that she has diabetes and needs to have more insulin injections. she can't have her blood sugar level checked. she would like to know what her medication is and if she can get a prescription. she should have her doctor check her again. her doctor has never seen her before so she should be able to get her medication back. she gets more frequent exams and tests. she usually has her blood

Expected Response: i'm sorry your mom is going through this. she did the right thing in consulting a doctor. however that's not the end of the story. the fact she continues to have symptoms without a diagnosis means she should go back to her doctor. many conditions can cause the symptoms you list. some of those conditions can take a long time and a lot of testing to diagnose. if you didn't get an acceptable answer from your mother's health care provider before it's time to go back and get an explanation. if you don't feel your mother's health care provider is giving you an adequate explanation for her symptoms then you can consider getting a second opinion. i hope this helps!

Answer- My doctor told me that I need to take a test. I was told that I am not a woman. I do not know what to expect from this. I have not had a test yet and I need one soon

Expected Response: the ma healthconnector is the ma insurance exchange -- an online tool where you can compare and shop for health plans. it is not an insurance company. do you recall signing up for a plan through a particular health insurance company such as tufts or ma blue cross blue shield? if so i suggest you call them directly to see if your application is in process.

Question: i think i had genital herpies 35 years ago. never tested. can i be tested now? . i was not sure if it was genital herpies or not. never diagnosed by a dr. have not had other outbreaks. subject came up recently & i would like to know if i have it dormant in me. is there a test for this?
Baseline Response: yes. if you have a male genital herpes, you need to have your test to see if it is dormant. If it is, you will need to get your test done to see what it looks like. If you do not have a test, you can get your male genital virus test done in your doctor's office. You will also need to keep your test positive for herpes and your male herpes test negative for your female genital herpes. If your male is positive for genital herpes but you don't have genital herpes then you will have genital herps and you will be tested.
Answer to: genital herpes

Expected Response: millions of people have latent antibodies that show they have had some form of herpes in the past. on the lips (cold sores fever blisters) in the genital areas chicken pox (also a herpes virus) or shingles (herpes zoster). while you may be able to be dna lab tested to see if you have these specific antibodies it would not necessarily show the type of herpes you had when you may have contracted it or if you are now are considered a person with a dormant form of herpes. basically once you have the herpes virus. you will always have it. since her post herpes infection was "self-diagnosed" you may have been wrong.
================================================================================
Question: what progress are drug companies/researchers making toward a cure for genital herpes?
Baseline Response: The problem is that many of the best efforts to develop a cure have been lost.
In fact, there are now only three effective treatments for genital infections that are effective in preventing or preventing genital herpes, and all of them are safe.
The most recent successful treatment was the treatment for genital chlamydia in the US (see here, here and here), and it's currently being used in most countries. In the US, the FDA has found that it has the most effective treatment, and it has been approved in some countries.
I've been told that there are many other effective treatments that are also effective in reducing genital herpes. For example, in the UK, a vaccine is being developed to prevent genital herpes in the children. It is recommended that the child be vaccinated against genital herpes for the first time, and that the vaccine should be administered every six months.

Expected Response: allopathic system believes that genital herpes is incurable. it has been discovered that natural remedies help to prevent recurrent outbreaks by boosting immune system. herbs such as hypericum mysorense is traditionally believed to have antiviral properties.

Question: do cardiac rehabilitation programs address sex?
Baseline Response: Yes. The only medical treatment available to females with a history of heart failure is cardiac rehabilitation.
(Source: American Heart Association, 2011)

Source(s): http://njnews.com/health/health-and-safety/heartbeat-care-and.html
Source of information: http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
Source also: http:/www.health.gov.

Expected Response: they may do that indirectly. when heart patients worry about sexual function a lot of their concerns are related to confidence and fear. after a heart attack they feel that if they try to go for a run they'll drop dead. cardiac rehab through structure and supervised exercise programs teaches people that it's ok for them to exercise it's ok for them to exert themselves and to get back in the game. i think once they have that confidence they can go out and use it whether it's on the treadmill or in the bedroom.

Question: does penicillin go in a mans semen sperm? . my fiance has been taking penicillin vk 500mg for three days and we forgot and made love; i have a sever reaction to penicillin should i be worried?
Baseline Response: I have a male ejaculatory syndrome in which the penis is not erect, my vagina is not full of semen, and I have had two or three ejaculatory episodes in the past 3 months. I have not had a penicillic test or blood test for the past 2 years, and my penis is still erect. I think I am not a penis freak, I am an honest man who likes to ejaculate. I am in a relationship and have been with my fiance for 3 years and my fiance told me he has a problem with his penis because of his penis. My fiance has a history of having an abnormal vaginal discharge and my partner has never had a problem. I believe that my penis needs to be checked and tested

Expected Response: hi if you did get some of his penicillin the amount in sperm would only be very minute not enough to give you a problem. you need to think of the amount going around his body and the amount that would get into his sperm and take it from there. do hope this helps. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what is the best over the counter diet pill for weight loss and energy
Baseline Response: the best is the over the top version of the over-the-counter diet pill. This is the most effective over the board diet pill in terms of weight loss.
A lot of people have tried to over the over top version. They have tried the over 2 year version and the over 1 year version of their over the 1 year diet pill, but the over over the first version was not enough to get them to stop trying it.
So, I would suggest that over the 2 year over the under the 1 day version, you can do a bit of work to get you to stop. It is also recommended to use the over a month diet pill that is less expensive.
How do I know if I am getting the right amount of weight?
As mentioned before, the over weight version is much more effective than the over and under version.
The over weight pill is actually more

Expected Response: my gut response to this is: none of them. diet pills are not the answer for long-term weight loss and energy. the best way to lose weight and increase energy is simple. eat a healthy balanced diet and exercise regularly (at least three times a week). if you do just these two things and do them consistently you'll lose weight keep it off and probably see your energy level rise considerably. check out webmd's diet community for plenty of tips of on how safely lose weight and keep it off for good! all the best to you! although some diet pills may work to promote weight loss and boost energy are the side effects really worth it? take alli for example the first fda approved over-the-counter weight loss pill. some of the side effects of alli include oily or fatty stools and difficulty controlling bowel movements that can cause leakage into undergarments. also although rare a more serious problem is possible liver damage. keep in mind that alli is actually approved by the fda undergoing a very extensive process while many other pills or supplements have no additional research to verify their claims or identify risks. the answer is simple: diet pills can’t replace healthy lifestyle behavior changes like implementing an exercise routine or eating whole food to promote weight loss. my husband and i started to use myfitnesspal. com 3 weeks ago and i have lost 3 pounds already. we are not going hungry just counting our calories and cutting our portions as we have always been big portion eaters. we are also walking from 45 min to 60 min at least 3 times a week which gives you more calories. we usually don't use them though because the calories for women are 1200 and men are 1500. this system is a very good way to learn to eat better. log in and check it out. you will be surprised and happy with what you find. taking diet pills will only curb your appetite they will not help you stay healthy. they can also lead to an addiction. you do need to do some form of exercise like walking or biking. i am not familiar so much familiar with over the counter weight loss pills but i suggest that you speak with dr. eric schweiger an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at mount sinai medical center. he can help you with your weight loss plans. <link>

Question: how long does it take for food to pass through the stomach and small intestine to the large intestine?
Baseline Response: It is a very long time. A very large intestine is about the size of a large person's intestines, so it takes about a year for it to get to the small intestine. It takes about three years for the small intestines to get through the small bowel to the big intestine.
Source: The Digestive System of the American Diet
The digestive system of the human body is the major organ responsible for digesting and storing food, which is one of the most important functions of a human being. It is also responsible for maintaining the immune system, digestion and absorption of nutrients and wastes from the body, and for detoxifying the body from toxins.
The stomach is the largest portion of the body. It contains about one-third of the total body weight, which means that it has about 50% of the fat in the stomach.
When the stomach

Expected Response: the transit time is quite variable in all people. there are no set times. food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hours. or days. in babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid. babies often poop while you are feeding them! in some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation. transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volume/size of meal the amount of water/fluids and the amount of fiber/solids. spicy food may be faster than you anticipated. a heavy thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more. this is a very interesting question. there are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. to start the type of food matters. some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. on the other hand other foods won’t have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly. fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else. the answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender. you have to consider that people’s digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways. did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people? certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest. also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too. how long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors. dosent it only takes 30 mins?

Question: how is toxoplasmosis diagnosed?
Baseline Response: toxoplasma is a very rare disease that is characterized by a sudden, severe, and persistent increase in the size of the small intestine. The disease can be diagnosed by a combination of blood tests and laboratory tests.
What is toxplasmosis?
Toxoplasmoses are small, infectious diseases that are caused by a single parasite. They are usually caused by either a virus or a parasite that is present in the environment.
Toxic infections are often caused by the presence of a parasite in the body. In some cases, the parasite is a virus. The parasite that causes toxoplasia is called a Toxoplasma gondii.
How does toxoplasma get into the body?
When a person is exposed to a parasite, the virus can enter the body through the bloodstream. The body is then unable to repair itself. The virus then enters the body by secretions through the intestines

Expected Response: there are many different kinds of blood tests for toxoplasmosis. the results can determine if the patient has had toxo and whether the infection is recent or not.
================================================================================
Question: how is c. difficile passed from person to person
Baseline Response: The same applies to the c. f. diffi. of a piece of wood.
The same applies also to the s. diff. of an article.
For example, in the following example, the c is passed from one person to another, and the s is passed by one person, and so on.
Here the c = s is not passed from the one person in the wood to the other person in another wood. Therefore the s = s.
Now, it is evident that the c would not be passed from c to s in the same way that the s would be passed.
But there is one difference which will explain the difference between the s and the c: the s will be passed into the other wood, and therefore the c will not be transferred from the s to the wood in the first place.
Therefore, the s should be transferred into the c, and

Expected Response: this is a very good question. clostridium difficile (or c. diff) is a highly contagious bacterium that is spread by direct contact. it's important to note that antiseptic hand cleaners are not effective against c. diff. good hand hygiene is extremely important in avoiding the spread of c. diff. if you are providing care for someone with c. diff you should consider wearing protective paper gowns and discarding them after each patient contact. try not to come in contact with any of the patient's feces (though c. diff gets spread onto pretty much all the surfaces a c. diff patient comes in contact with). wash your hands after every contact with a c. diff patient. to wash properly first turn on the water tap and wet your hands. then add soap and work into a vigorous lather. rinse the soap off thoroughly. dry thoroughly. (the drying part is very important because it helps ensure the bacteria don't linger in the wonderful moist skin environment. ) if you maintain good hand hygiene you can help avoid spreading this awful bacteria. hope this helps!

Question: pregnacy test is negative but am spotting still. i had sex on the 6th september and 2days after started getting a brown discharge no itching oder or anything then a week passed and it turned into spotting blood. 4 days before my period i took a pregnancy test and it came back negative could i still be pregnant and i also lost a lot of weight.
Baseline Response: Answer to:
1. You should always take your period regularly.
2. It can be a little tricky to get your periods right.
3. Some women are so stressed about having an abortion that they have to take the pill every day.
4. The pill does not help much.
5. Some men who have had a miscarriage or a miscarriage end up having a miscarriage.
6. Some guys get pregnant after having an ectopic pregnancy, so the pill does NOT help.
7. Some pregnant women who have been on the pill for a while and get pregnant

Expected Response: hi so did you get your period yet? if no then now is the time to do a test if yes then the odds are your not pregnant but it is possible to have a sort period and still be pregnant but you would still need to do that test either and hpt or better still at your doctors if its negative then see him/her about your spotting problem. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: can a lack of nicotine cause hallucinations for someone who has smoked for years? . i have been smoking for a number of years and decided to stop. i have been smoke free for 2 weeks but have started hallucinating can the lack of nicotine cause that?
Baseline Response: can it cause hallucinations or does it just cause pain or irritability? i have had some mild hallucinations but no long term effects.
Answer 2: can you get a headache when you smoke? i am sure that it is a symptom of a bad night's sleep.

Expected Response: no

Question: how long is it safe to keep makeup products?
Baseline Response: it is safe to store all your makeup products in a safe and secure place, and they are safe to use for a long time.

Expected Response: if you keep your cosmetics for too long you could cause breakouts and potential infection in your skin. as a rule of thumb liquid foundation should only be kept for 6 months lipstick for 8 months powdered makeup for 1 year and mascara for 2 to 3 months.
================================================================================
Question: does concerta cause your stool to turn black?
Baseline Response: it is a very common issue, but it is not something that is uncommon.

Expected Response: no. this is not an adverse effect of concerta. black stools are often feared because they could indicate stomach bleeding but some foods (like spinach or black licorice) and some medications (pepto bismol) will also turn the stools black. since i don't know your medical history please consult your medical provider for patient-specific advice.
================================================================================
Question: what is otolaryngology testing?
Baseline Response: otolariesngology is the study of the abnormal tissues in the body. The study of abnormal tissues is the main part of the medical profession. In otolarialngology, there is a lot of research done on the causes of abnormal tissue. The main part is to look at the tissue with an eye to see what is happening in the tissues.
One of the important things to remember is that the abnormal tissue is not the same as normal tissue. It is different. The normal tissue is the part of a muscle, the muscle with the large pores. If you do not see it, you are not sure what it is. If it is abnormal, you may have an abnormality in the muscle. The abnormality is called an abnormal tissue.
The abnormal tissue can be a part of any muscle. It may be an organ, a tissue, a blood vessel. It can be abnormal in the liver

Expected Response: oto means ear and laryngo means your voice box (or larynx). otolaryngology is another name for an ent (ear nose and throat) specialist. there is really no such thing as otolarynology testing per se unless this is referring to a referral to an ent for "tests" whatever they might be.

Question: sitting in front of a window unit cause sniffles? how long will they last when you move away from the front of the unit?
Baseline Response: I know you're probably going to want to move away.
I'm not a big fan of moving away. I don't think we can do it.
So what I mean is: if you have a unit with a lot of windows and a lot more people than you can comfortably have, then you need to be careful.
It's not always easy to have a window with a few people and a few windows with a couple people. I've seen people who just moved out of their house, they couldn't even have a view of the street, and they were in front for over a year.
The problem is that we've had the worst experience of any building in the world in terms of people moving in, and that's the real problem.
There are some people who are out of town, and I know

Expected Response: it would only cause "sniffles" if those sniffles were to do environmental allergies like pollens or molds. allergies can last a long. long time so it would not be possible to make a general prediction on the duration of symptoms. cold breezes open windows will not cause colds. colds are caused by viruses and viruses last about a week.

Question: i have medicare but i'm also a veteran. . since i get most if not all of my medical care through them how will the aca affect my medical care? also what would be the best medical insurance for me to look into? for all veterans?
Baseline Response: i think i would be better off with medicare.
Answer 2: I have medicaid but i don't have medical insurance.

Expected Response: anyone with insurance coverage through the va and/or medicare is not affected. you have insurance coverage and you don't need to change what you have. the marketplaces are not for people already covered by the programs you mentioned.

Question: is it harmful to drink alcoholic beverages while taking prednisone?
Baseline Response: it is not harmful to take prednisolone in moderation. It is harmful to use prednisoline to treat certain conditions such as heart problems, diabetes, osteoporosis and other health issues.

Expected Response: currently there are no drug-drug interactions between alcoholic beverages and prednisone. however new drug interactions may be discovered. so it is important to check with your health care professional especially the pharmacist to make sure it is still ok to take this combination together. prednisone and alcohol even when ingested separately can have the potential to cause irritation to the gastrointestinal system leading to an increased risk for stomach ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. know more here <link>

Question: hypothyroidism. i just had my blood works done and my doctor saw that my calcium levels are slightly above my normal range. my potassium has been low for quite some time now as well. for the past 5 to 6 years i have been feeling tired intermittently. i don't sleep well and when i wake up (even with 8 hours of sleep) i don't feel rested. also i've noticed that i've been having low-grade fever. i seem to be more sensitive to cold weather. i noticed also that i can feel some hot areas on my skin.
Baseline Response: hypotension. i've had my thyroid function tested for hypothyothyroid syndrome (also known as hypothyrocholesterol). I have had a high blood pressure and I'm about to be sick. my heart rate is very high. i was diagnosed with thyroid dysfunction at the age of 10. my body has been working very hard to improve my health and I've been taking all

Expected Response: hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. the most common cause of thyroid gland failure is called autoimmune thyroiditis a form of thyroid inflammation caused by the patient's own immune system.
================================================================================
Question: if i have oral sex with female with inactive genital herpes will i be infected?
Baseline Response: yes
Answer to the question is: yes. If you are an active female, you are a potential infection with herpes. The following are a few of the more common ones that may be present in your body:

Lithosis: If you have lithosis in your vagina, you may be infected with herpes from oral sex. If so, you should seek medical care immediately.

Hepatitis B: If your immune system is weakened, you could become infected with hepatitis B. If your body is weakened and you have hepatitis B, you might be infected. If this is the case, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. If hepatitis B is present, you will likely be infected because your body can not absorb it.
: If the body cannot absorb it, it will become infected. Your body can only absorb certain foods.
 and if your body

Expected Response: maybe. many people who contract herpes are from partners that do not show any signs of active disease so most clinicians feel that the herpes virus is capable of shedding even during dormant periods.
================================================================================
Question: how do you get adhesive bandadge guaze unstuck from a cut?
Baseline Response: This is where the adhesive bandage comes in. It's a nice piece of adhesive, and the adhesive is hard, so you can easily get it off. I usually stick to a very thin strip of adhesive strip, and then apply it to the cut.
I usually stick with a very thick strip of tape, and cut through the adhesive, using a small piece of tape. The tape will stick to the adhesive strip.
You will need a 2 inch square piece of strip that has a hole in the middle. I use a piece of thin paper towel to hold the tape in place.
The tape is very sticky and will stick. It will be very difficult to get rid of, so I use the adhesive strips on the left side of the cut, and I stick a small hole in them.
Then I use adhesive strip on the right side of this cut. I put

Expected Response: several ways you can try. 1. alcohol on a cotton ball or swab (don't get it in the cut) 2. mineral oil 3. take a shower with the bandage on (assuming you get the wound wet).

Question: we have seen a dr for my baby's very severe diaper rash and are using rx cream but nothing seems to work. she has had the rash for about 2 weeks in different states throughout. it has been the "1 step forward 2 steps" back sort of thing. she has open sores that have gotten to a point where they have shrunk but refuse to heal any more. she has also been on oral antibiotics for 3 days now. today the actual 'rash' part of it that we thought had finally gone away has resurfaced with a vengence. . please help with any suggestions.
Baseline Response: I am going to use rx to clean up my diaper rash. I have had a rash for a few weeks now and I think it is getting worse. It has been a long time since I have been using it and I am having trouble keeping it off. It is a bit of a pain but it is working and I'm getting the feeling it will get

Expected Response: i experienced something similar with my baby girl and the only thing that worked was this over the counter stuff called domeboro. it came in little packets that you just mix with water and soak their tush in. it was the only thing that would work and it helped immediately! i think you may be able to find it at walgreens.

Question: my husband is self-employed and we have a high deductible bcbs policy. . we are able to deduct cost of health insurance on taxes. if we were to get a policy through the marketplace would we lose that deduction? also i had a brief conversation with someone from bcbs who lead me to think that we will have to change policies. i was very confused.
Baseline Response: this is a very difficult question. i understand the issue but i can't really explain it to you because i don't have a good answer. i am currently in a job interview, i am going to take my job to a local hospital, and i am paying for it. i will have no trouble getting my deductible down. also i am not able to find a good policy that is going to cover my deductible. i can see that my deductible is going up, but i do not know if it will cover the cost of the health insurance I am currently enrolled in. so i am unsure if this

Expected Response: if you get a policy through the marketplace you can still deduct the cost of insurance from your taxes. if you qualify for a subsidy that lowers your insurance costs the amount would be offset by the amount of the subsidy you receive. regarding the changing policies many existing insurance plans don't meet the requirements of the law. in that case you would be required to switch policies. and you would be best served to shop all of your options and not just move to the plan bcbs pushes you toward.
================================================================================
Question: what are the symptoms of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: toxoplasma is a highly contagious disease that is often seen in newborns. It is spread through the blood and is usually seen by a mother's blood. It can be very difficult to detect and treat toxoplasia, but it is usually fatal.
What causes toxoplasms?
Toxoplasm is a common cause of birth defects. The majority of toxplasmosis can be caused by a number of factors. The most common cause is an inherited abnormality, which is caused by the gene mutations that cause a certain type of immune system.
Toxic plasmosis usually occurs in women with Down syndrome or who have an inherited genetic disorder. Women with Down Syndrome are more susceptible to toxoplasms than those with normal or normal immune systems.
How can I avoid toxoplasty?
Do not give your baby toxoplastic medication. If you are pregnant or are planning to

Expected Response: in a person with a healthy immune system when first infected with toxoplasmosis most people don't get sick. a few people have mild flu -like symptoms which can last as long as several months. this is why people rarely know whether or when they have had toxoplasmosis. symptoms can include: swollen glands. muscle aches. fatigue. fever. sore throat. skin rash. in a newborn most infected newborns have no symptoms at birth. but without treatment some can develop eye or brain damage that ranges from mild to severe. blindness can develop up to 20 years after birth but this is rare. some infected newborns have severe symptoms at birth including: eye pain vision problems or blindness. brain damage leading to intellectual disability and occasionally seizures. in a person with a weak immune system a person who has a very weak immune system (weakened by hiv infection organ transplant medicines or lymphoma ) can develop life-threatening toxoplasmosis. antibiotic therapy is often used to prevent this from happening. severe infection requires aggressive treatment. in very rare cases otherwise healthy people who get toxoplasmosis can have severe symptoms related to the brain eyes lungs or heart. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: penis internal cut. at 20 was regularly masturbating 10 times a day twice continuously. at 30 i found it burns when urinating or soap comes in contact inside of penis opening. now at 40 have drastically reduced masturbation to 1 in 4 days but burning when i urinate has not stopped. the burning happens somewhere on the top side of the penis opening it subsides after 10min. is there a cure? is there a medicine to apply inside of penis to treat the cut?
Baseline Response: Yes. The foreskin is a thin layer of mucous that is not attached to the penis. It is not able to hold on to the mucus. It can only hold on the foreskin. If the foreskin is cut, the skin becomes wet and the skin is dry. If it is cut in a different way, the foreskin will burn. When the foreskin burns, the blood starts to flow to the area of the cut. When there is a small amount of blood flowing to the cut,

Expected Response: hi have you ever been tested for a uti? the problem every time you urinate anything you put in will get washed away the only thing you could try is this sea salt is very good at cleaning tears and wounds then it aids healing so you need some made up in an eye dropper bottle after each urination put some in and let it drip outwash the dropper then put it back change it daily and keep it extra clean see how that gets on. hope this helps you. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what can i expect with treatment for stage 2 ovarian cancer?
Baseline Response: we are looking for a team of experts to help us determine if the cancer is a genetic predisposition or an inherited disease. We will also have to decide if it is a disease of the ovary or ovarian follicles. We expect to find out if there is a link between the two diseases. We are looking at a large number of different factors, including the type of tissue that was harvested from the ovaries, the number of cells in the ovules, the size of the ovarian follicle, and the extent of the tumour. We don't know for sure whether the ovarian cancer is inherited or not.
We will also need to determine whether there is any known risk for the disease to spread to other organs.
Our goal is to determine if there are any other possible causes of the disease.
What do you think about the research?
Our research team is looking at the potential of chemotherapy

Expected Response: am not sure what type of chemotherapy you will be receiving but this usually includes a platinum drug and a taxane drug. a description of chemotherapy side effects can be found on the women's cancer network web site. this site has been developed by the gynecologic cancer foundation and contains a lot of good information about ovarian cancer.

Question: can you inherit depression from your parents?
Baseline Response: I think that I have inherited depression from my parents.
In my opinion, I would like to say that I did not inherit depression in my father's absence.
It was not until after my father died that I had the first opportunity to see the world in my mother's eyes.
During my father-in-law's life, I was able to learn about the world through his movies and my literature, and I was a part of the cultural life of my father.
I am also very grateful for my father for giving me the opportunity to become a writer and a writer.
He taught me the importance of being a writer, and the importance to be a writer for the future of mankind.
As a child, my father taught me that the key to happiness is to be strong and to be self-sufficient.
My father was very optimistic and optimistic about my future.
After my father passed away,

Expected Response: 1. depression may be inherited from family members. the more family you have that are depressed the more likely you will be. perhaps genetics is to blame for about 30% of depression where stress family upbringing trauma and personality style is the other 70%. 2. you may inherit genes for depression. you can also inherit the ability to respond to certain medicines that other family members respond too. so if your dad responded well to prozac your chances are good too as you likely have the same type of 'genetic' depression which was reversed by prozac in your dad. doctors should ask you if you have had a family history of depression and what meds your family took and their response to it.

The most common over-The-counter migraine treatment is the over- The-counter treatment of over- Over the counter migraine is a migraine medicine for migraine headaches. Over-The Counter is an over-counter medication that is administered to patients in the following ways:
• Over- The Counter is administered by a physician who has a specialized practice in the treatment and management of migraine headaches;

The Over-Treatments are administered in the form of the over the counter medication, the over a prescription, the Over a prescription that is prescribed to a patient and/or their healthcare

Expected Response: there is no stronger over-the-counter medication for headache or migraine pain relief. headaches are very individualized. there are several over-the-counter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches. these medications include acetaminophen (tylenol) an effective over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) medication. this medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever. however it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties. this is important for some types of headache relief. in addition the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug class (nsaids) consists of products like ibuprofen (motrin advil) and naproxen (naprosyn aleve) which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. lastly combination products such as excedrin migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. these ingredients combined make a more powerful headache/pain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone. it is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity. monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication. if you're 18 or older advil migrane and excedrin migrane are really good. i don't know about all around pain relievers. advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fast-acting it also lasts all day. excedrin migrane is supposedly the safest and #1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine. also if you're not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please don't take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason.

2) They produce eggs. They can be found in every location where there are many species of moths and they are most commonly found in gardens.
Pants are a family of invertebrates. They feed on invertebrate food such as grasshoppers, worms, worms' eggs, or insects. The

Expected Response: no i don't think you will experience any health consequences from ingesting a moth eggs or larvae. your gastrointestinal tract will likely do a fine job in digesting it safely. as you may know many societies eat all types of insects as part of their normal diet. most people do not choose to eat moths but i believe this would be harmless. my dog eats them all of the time and i suspect that i have inadvertently eaten a few in my life as well.

Baseline Response: 1 year old boy has swollen (stiff) nipple and is not breathing properly. . he has swollen nipple and no pain. . the problem is the lump in the nipple is leaking blood.
Answer 2: A 7 year old girl has pain in her left breast and is bleeding profusely. . she has swollen breast and no problems. . her pain is coming from her nipples.

Expected Response: most helpful answer he may have adolescent gynecomastia -- an unwelcomed hormonal gift associate with puberty. this is relatively common but an embarrassment to boys. don't get me wrong. teen boys admire breasts but they don't want to grow their own. you can find lots of information about this temporary condition on the internet so you both can read it. this condition can last about two years and can involve both breasts not just one. there is nothing medically that can be done to stop it and nearly all will eventually resolve. i have seen thousands in my practice and only one had to have surgery to remove this breast tissue. if he doesn't want to take off his shirt at home or wear one at the pool let him. don't let other siblings or friends tease him either.

Answer 2: no, but it's not a big one. if

Expected Response: hi i have this from the uk’s nhs its all pretty standard stuff for flying but you have that extra problem i think like they say get this all in place before you even think about booking. before you travel. if you're planning on travelling by plane you should discuss this with your midwife or gp. before you book your tickets check with your airline and insurance company that they will allow you to travel while pregnant. after week 28 of the pregnancy most airlines require a letter from your midwife or gp confirming: that you're in good health that you have a normal pregnancy the expected date of delivery be aware that your gp may charge you for the letter. your gp surgery can give you more information about what their charges are. some airlines may require medical clearance if: your delivery date is less than four weeks after your departure date or any complications are expected in your delivery. this may involve your gp or midwife filling in a form or an assessment by the airline staff. check with your airline as the restrictions can vary. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: i pulled my hip flexors a few years ago have hip pain that keeps me up at night now that i work out more. help? . i ran track and played sports my whole life without a problem until i was 15. starting then i had knee pain followed by hip pain that was so severe at times i had trouble walking up stairs. now i'm 18 and started working out more my hips bother me more than ever to the point of keeping me up at night; despite stretching almost every day. the dull pain there and sometimes in my knees leads me to think i have iliotibial band syndrome. is this a reasonable guess?
Baseline Response: Yes it is. i have a hip flexor issue. i just started out doing yoga and my back pain has gotten worse. I'm not sure if this is due to muscle weakness or simply the fact that i'm not able to walk or stand. I do not believe that i have the ability to walk with my hips

Question: could i still be pregant or what else is wrong? . i suppose to came on my period on february the 17th it never came and now its march and its still not here i have frequent urination. i went to the hospital they say i'm not pregnant what else can be wrong or could i still be pregnant.

Question: what other medications are used for treating migraine headaches?
Baseline Response: migraine headache is the most common headache in the world, and the majority of people who suffer from migraine headache have no history of migraine headaches. In order to get the best results from your own research, it is important to check your own medications to see if they work well for you. Some medications you might be interested in are:

Percoplanir

Ephedrine

Prozac

Aldaparin

Migraine

Caffeine

Antibiotics

You may also be interested to know that some medications like Prozac, Avastin, and Prozac are also known to be effective for treating migraines.

Another option is to try a combination of these medications.
.
"Migraines are the most commonly encountered headache in our country, and they are the only major headache in which there is an underlying medical condition that

Expected Response: narcotics and butalbital-containing medications sometimes are used to treat migraine headaches; however these medications are potentially addictive and are not used as initial treatment. they are sometimes used for individuals whose headaches fail to respond to over-the-counter medications but who are not candidates for triptans either due to pregnancy or the risk of heart attack and stroke. in patients with severe nausea a combination of a triptan and an antinausea medication for example prochlorperazine (compazine) or metoclopramide (reglan) may be used. when nausea is severe enough that oral medications are impractical intravenous medications such as dhe-45 (dihydroergotamine) prochlorperazine (compazine) and valproate (depacon) are useful.
================================================================================
Question: if your patient wanted to go off meds and had no major episodes of manic depression for a while what would you advise?
Baseline Response: If you are in a hospital, go to the Emergency Department or your local hospital emergency room, check with your physician if they have a prescription.
If your patient is in a group of five or more, ask your doctor to see a nurse. If the patient does not have any major episodes and is in the group of 5 or more you should see a psychiatrist.
What is the dose of antidepressants in your medication?
You may need to ask your physician. If you need to take a drug, call your doctor.
Do you have an emergency?
Call 911 if you have a serious emergency, such as an accident or illness. Call your doctor or go to a local emergency room to see your doctor if you are not taking any medications.
How do I know if my medication is taking a toll on my brain?
If

Expected Response: it would depend on the patient. if they had a history of multiple significant manic or depressive episodes i would counsel them that their decision was very risky and probably ill-advised and warn them of the likelihood of relapse and clarify what their wishes would be should they relapse. in my experience in people with bipolar i disorder an eventual relapse off medicines is almost always inevitable and i don't know that there is any "natural" way to avoid that. i would encourage regular ongoing monitoring/visits and enlist their family as look-outs on the team. if they had a history of suicide attempts or hospitalization or psychosis in the last few years i would probably urge them against a very dangerous idea and personally not feel comfortable being cast as simply an onlooker to looming disaster. in someone who had a history of episodes long ago who's been stable for at least several years no suicide attempts functioning well they're responsible family is supportive no drugs or alcohol relationships and work are stable/steady and they know what to watch for and could catch a looming relapse quickly so we could nip it in the bud and were agreeable to resuming medicines at the first signs of relapse i would probably be much more encouraging.

Question: why does my nose run all the time? . its not all the time but it feels like its always running. i have noticed that im always sniffling or blowing my nosse.
Baseline Response: it is the first time i have seen my nose running all the way to the ground. i did not see my nose go all the WAY to the floor, but when i did see it go to the top of my nose, i was afraid that i was going to have my nose pulled off and that i would be dead. i tried to open my eyes but it was too late. i opened my eyes again and the nose stopped running all over me.
A short time later, when i was thinking of getting my nose off, i saw my nose start running all across my face. i ran for about 10 seconds, then the nose started running all around my face and then stopped and i closed my eyes. i was scared of what was happening to my nose. i thought that

Expected Response: sorry to hear of this. dealing with a constantly runny nose can be very annoying! the medical term for a runny nose is rhinitis. the runnyness is caused by inflammation of the nasal tissue. the most common type of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis. however it's possible to have the non-allergic variety too. another flavor of rhinitis is called gustatory rhinitis and this refers to getting a runny nose when you eat. other things can cause a runny nose such as exposure to cold weather. if you've never been diagnosed with nasal allergies this would be a good time to see your health care provider to determine if your runny nose is caused by allergies or not. if it is an over-the-counter or prescription medication may help dry up your nasal tissue. if your runny nose is not caused by allergies then your only option may be to invest in a lot of tissue. not the best news i know. hope this helps!
================================================================================
Question: is your heart pounding for hours a sign of anxiety attacks?
Baseline Response: it's the type of anxiety you feel when you have to work out or do a workout, or when you're stressed. It's a common symptom of many chronic diseases that cause chronic heart failure.
The American Heart Association recommends that you take anti-inflammatory medications before you begin exercise. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't take them, however. Many people have difficulty breathing or feeling their heart rate.
What are the symptoms of heart failure?
Most people who have heart failure develop a form of hemolysis.
This is the most common cause of heart disease, but there are also some that can cause heart failure, such as a heart attack.
Heart failure is the result of an imbalance of blood vessels in the heart. This causes the heart to stop pumping and the heart stops beating.
In most cases, heart failure is caused by the overactive heart muscle.
Because the heart

Expected Response: it can but i never say it's anxiety until after there's been a full medical exam to rule out anything physical. you should consider doing this and also take a look to see if you might be experiencing undue stress lack of sleep or anything else that might have triggered this.

Baseline Response: not a problem.

Expected Response: you should never stop taking insulin unless specifically advised to do so by the medical provider who is treating your diabetes. and you should definitely not start eating sugar! if your blood sugar is normal perhaps it is because you are on the proper dose of insulin and you are now eating more appropriately. please call your doctor before thinking of making any changes in your medical regime.

Question: how often can i give my infant steroid inhalers?
Baseline Response: you can only give one inhaler at a time and it will take a lot longer for your baby to get it. There are many reasons why you can't give your inhalers to your baby, but this article will show you which ones are the best and which ones you should use.
I do not recommend using any other medications than your own.
How long do you think your baby will be using steroids?
I think your child will be getting the most from steroids as it is a very good reason to use them. However, if your baby is still getting the steroids you mentioned, then you should not use them in the first place.
What is the best way to give your baby the most steroids? (In my opinion, it is the easiest)
The best way for your child to get the most out of steroids is to use the most effective method for giving them steroids. This method is

Baseline Response: no. i am not aware of any studies that show that scizor is safe. i do not know if scizoria is safe or not.
I know that the studies that do not show a link between scizeria and scizoral immunity are very small. i have read a lot of the studies and they were not looking at the specific scizore that was found. i know that some of the ones that did show a protective effect are the ones from the US, but the studies of those that did not show protective effect were from the UK. i think that scizoins are not very safe.
My question is, what about sc

Expected Response: schisandra has the potential to interact with many different medications -- either increasing or decreasing the medication's effects in the body. be very careful taking this with your medications and don't take it without first checking with your doctor. as with many supplements we don't have enough information to know what effects it may have particularly in someone on medications like humira and methotrexate. medscape. com (its a site for physicians) has a free drug interaction checker that is really helpful. here's a link: <link> i hope this helps.

Expected Response: not all colds are the same and each person responds to them differently. i do not know your medical history or the type of anesthesia your dentist is planning to use so these decisions are made on an individual basis. by the dentist. generally it is safe to undergo dental procedures with a cold but the dentist will need to make that call.

Question: what is 0-negative arthritis?
Baseline Response: 0-positive arthritis is a condition in which a person is unable to produce or maintain sufficient strength to perform a task or perform a function.
A person who is able to produce 0- negative arthritis can be referred to as "a person with a disability".

Expected Response: this is probably what is referred to as "sero-negative arthritis. " this is a form of arthritis that is characterized by inflammation (hot swollen tender painful stiff) of joints but is not associated with the classic blood (serum) test for rheumatoid arthritis called rheumatoid factor. we refer to these patients as being rheumatoid factor negative in their serum or seronegative. the term is nonspecific and it is possible for a patient's condition to evolve at a later time into a more classical identifiable disease.

Question: is any exercise safe while taking cipro? how long after 30 days of treatment should i wait before working with weights? . i have been working out for the last 2 years and find myself in decent shape for a 50 year old male. was starting a hardcore workout plan but have stopped. i have been having some urologic issues and after having multiple scans done the doctors are not seeing anything so my doctor has put me on cipro for 30 days. he specifically told me not to lift anything heavy due to possible tendon rupture and from what i see the risk continues even for several months after completing the medication.
Baseline Response: ciprolizumab is not effective in the short term. There is a limited amount of ciproxil in the body and it is not a good option for my body. However, I have tried other medications and they have been successful and I am happy with the results. cipromatix is not only safe but it is

Expected Response: i do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on cipro or for months after. any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns. since i do not know you full medical history it is best to get patient-specific exercise parameters from your doctor -- someone who does have this information.

Question: how can i teach my child to floss and when should i start?
Baseline Response: I have a child who has been flossed. It is a very difficult task to flaze. If you have a flosser that you use for flossing, you can use a florer (a floss brush or a flitter). I have flossers that I use for hand floss, but I do not recommend this. I use a hand florer and I use it all the time. It takes me about 4-6 hours to flop your floss. If I flop my floss or I floss my child, it will not be good. I would recommend that you take care of your florer when you floss your child.

Expected Response: the best thing to do is to start out by flossing your child's teeth for them. as their manual dexterity develops they will start to do it themselves. i like to use the flavored flosses because it helps make flossing a fun experience for children. flossing videos featuring cartoon characters are also helpful.

Expected Response: hi well if its itching like crazy like i remember it does you could try some good olive oil virgin would be best or aloe vera gel both very safe i did my sons back with olive oil when he got sunburnt the other year he could not believe how good it was he's a chef and thinks its only for cooking with and salads. and the aloe vera is great for sunburn and your skin. see how you get on. good luck

Question: do i have a hernia? . i have a bulging mass to the right side of my groin sometimes after a workout. normally it goes away in the morning. it doesn't hurt at all. i had it for the past 10 years since college. female 34.
Baseline Response: i have an hernia. i have had it since college and i am a pretty good person. i am not a huge fan of sex or any other kind of physical activity. i do not like to take pictures or masturbate. i prefer to do the things i love, such as getting on my knees and getting off my ass. i'm pretty into getting down on my hands and knees and doing stuff like that. i was on my butt for a while when i was younger and it really got my attention. but i'm not really into getting off on my own. i like to have sex with women who are pretty and strong. i don't like being on my back or my knees

Expected Response: to summarise - in cases where there is an obvious swelling in the areas of the abdomen commonly associated with hernia and which is more obvious when you cough strain or stand up and which gets smaller or goes completely when you lie down. no other tests are usually needed.
================================================================================
Question: when is the earliest time to take a pregnancy test? can pregnancy tests give you a false negative.
Baseline Response: no.
Why is it so hard to get pregnant when you are not pregnant? The answer is that the test is not very reliable and you are often forced to take one. If you have an abnormal pregnancy test, you might be forced to go to a doctor and have a procedure called a "normal pregnancy test."
The doctor will be able to confirm the pregnancy and you will have a test that will show you that you are pregnant.
You will also have a chance to get a new birth certificate.
It is important to take the birth certificate because it is not always accurate. You will have to ask the doctor to check for an abnormal test.
There is no guarantee that you will get a test for a pregnancy.
If you have a normal pregnancy test and a normal birth certificate, you should have a pregnancy check in the hospital.
Do you

Expected Response: also best time to take one is with your morning oee. although if you are it'll show up anytime of day.

Question: severe pain in left ear. randomly i get pretty severe pain in my left ear. when looking straight its pretty painful but when i turn my head to the left it becomes an almost unbearable pain. it seems to come on at complete random and has been happening for about a year. the pain usually only lasts for a few hours but its happening often enough now that its starting to make me wonder if there is something wrong that i need to get checked out.
Baseline Response: i dont think its really that bad but i have had a couple of very bad experiences with the ear. i have been hearing it for about 5 years now and i have never really seen it in person. it is a very small part of the ear and I dont think anyone really knows what is happening in it but i know it can be very uncomfortable and the pain is very intense. it gets worse and worse as the more I have had to look at the pictures i have noticed its getting worse and it is starting to

Expected Response: of course you need to get it checked out. i am surprised that it took you a year to get to this point. there are many many causes of ear pain including many causes that do not involve the ear itself. it is going to take a thorough systemic diagnostic work-up to get to the bottom of this year-long issue.

Question: is shingles contagious?
Baseline Response: yes.
Shiny is a contagious disease that affects a person's immune system. It is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food.
If you are shingling, you may have shingled-like symptoms.
Why should I call my doctor if I have shings?
Shings can be contagious, and some people are more contagious than others.
Infection
Shingles are very common.
People who have shininess may not be able to walk well, have difficulty talking, and have pain in their eyes.
You may be contagious if you have:

shingles in the head or back

severe shingle

headache

dizziness

sleep problems

weakness or tingling in your hands

How should I know if I am contagious? I have been told shinglings may be a sign of a cold.
It

Question: is all vitamin d the same?
Baseline Response: yes, it is.
A typical vitamin D dose is 1.5–2 g, and it is usually 1.8–2.5 g.
Do you eat more vitamin D than you do other foods?
A: No.
If you are not eating vitamin D, you are probably eating too much of it.
Why is it important to get vitamin D?
The main purpose of vitamin D is to help break down the vitamin D.
Many people don't know that vitamin D helps to break down fat and carbohydrates.
Some people don, however, know that it also helps break down certain enzymes, which are essential for the body to make the body's own proteins.
You are not getting enough vitamin D to break the proteins in your body.
So, if you eat too much vitamin D in your diet, you may experience a decrease in your immune system.
How do I know if

Expected Response: vitamin d from sunlight foods and even vitamin supplements is not biologically active. it has to undergo two processes the first occurring in the liver which converts vitamin d to the 25(oh)d form also known as calcidiol or vitamin d². the kidney then makes the most active form 1 25(oh)²d also known as calcitriol or vitamin d³. if you check your bottle of vitamins or calcium + vitamin d supplements you can see which type you have been taking. currently the preferred supplement form may be vitamin d³ as it increases the amount of active vitamin d while increasing the time vitamin d is active in the blood and tissues.

Question: my mother is in the hospital with pneumonia. my son also has it and been on antibiotics for 4 days. can he visit her? . she is 80 years old and lives with us. my son is 11. i have no one to leave him with and i want to be with both of them. it is so difficult to have our family divided like this.
Baseline Response: my son's condition is improving and I am ready to be his dad. I am trying to find a way to make him understand that he needs to be loved, not to be treated like an empty shell.

Expected Response: you will need to ask your mother's doctor or the hospital since i do not know what kind of pneumonia she has.
================================================================================
Question: can washing my hair more than once a day lead to baldness?
Baseline Response: yes.
What's more, there's no scientific evidence to support this claim.
The body doesn't need to be told to wash its hair once a week, and it's not necessary.
Why?
Because hair can be easily damaged by washing it off.
In fact, the reason that hair is damaged is because it gets wet.
So, if you are washing your hair regularly, you're probably not going to get baldness.
But if you wash your hair once every other day, you will.
Now, this may sound like a ridiculous claim, but it's actually quite possible.
It's actually not.
You can avoid hair loss by washing your scalp once a month.
And if you do that, you can avoid baldness by washing off your hair.
That's right: you can get rid of hair loss in just one day.

Expected Response: absolutely not! you may shower as much as you please. it will not cause your hair to thin or fall out. in fact good scalp hygiene is always a great idea to ward off yeast or bacteria that may occupy the hair follicle and possibly cause skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) or folliculitis.
================================================================================
Question: is a bath safe when you have a yeast infection and pregnant
Baseline Response: Yes. A bath is safe when the bacteria are present in your blood and are not present in a blood vessel. A healthy child will not have a bacteria infection in their blood.
Answer to this question is based on your experience with the following questions:

Expected Response: i would not recommend it. i believe that it would irritate you more because you are actually sitting in whatever bacteria or dirt that you may have on you. it is also better to use soaps or shower gels that are fragrance free. hope this helps

Question: hi i'm 15 years old take nature-made b complex omega369 100mg ubiquinol daily is this okay? . i'm using nature-made super b-complex omega 3-6-9 and qunol 100mg ubuiquinol as alternative adhd medicine. i'm just concerned that these pills maybe detrimental. i've read the label on the nature-made super b-comples and it contains 6 667% daily value of thiamin 1 176% riboflavin and 250% b12. also the qunol has 100mg of pure coq10 (i've heard the reccomended amount was around 50mg) is this too much for my body to handle? should i cut the pills into smaller portions? please help! . thanks!
Baseline Response: no
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i'm not sure why you are taking all those supplements but let's go down the list. i don't know of any evidence that shows that taking large amounts of b vitamins is beneficial or particularly harmful. if you don't eat fish twice a week taking fish oil high in omega 3 fatty acids dha and epa can help but americans get more than enough omega 6 fatty acids so i'm not sure why this would be needed in a supplement. there seems to be some research that qunol (coenzyme10) can help people who take cholesterol lowering medications who have lower levels in the body but not sure how it helps the general population. i'm not familiar with ubuiquinol but like any supplement check to see if there is any research to show its safety and effectiveness. supplements are not regulated by the fda so safety has to be demonstrated by the company. according to a recent study in pediatrics teenagers fall short on various nutrients including magnesium phosphorus and vitamins a c and e. so if you feel your diet is lacking include a multivitamin that provides 100% daily value for the majority of vitamins and minerals. many people (of all ages) need to supplement with vitamin d because they get little sunshine and foods are generally low in this vitamin. recommendations for calcium at your age are 1300mg because this is a peak time for bone growth. one cup of milk 1. 5 ounce cheese and 6-8 ounce yogurt contains about 300mg calcium so if you are falling short you may want to consider supplementation. no supplement can make up for a diet poor in nutrition. i always recommend a food first strategy but sometimes supplementation is needed to fill nutrition gaps. and most importantly make sure supplements have the research behind them to show they are safe and effective. always check with your healthcare provider about supplements you take.

Baseline Response: there are many ways to stop your child from stealing.
Answer 1: The easiest way is to start with a parent who has been lying and lying to your child about it and then use the distraction of lies to get your child to believe that you have been lying to them.
The second step is to tell them that you are not lying about your child's behavior.
A third step is telling them that they have to be aware that their child is not doing anything wrong.
Solution: tell them to tell their parent.
If you tell your child that you do not want to tell your parent about your

Expected Response: dont lecture him. that doesnt help. children with add cannot sit there to focus long enough on what you are saying. pending on the age of your child find a reward system for good behavior and punishment system for bad behavior. let them figure out good consequences and bad consequences for themselves. it takes time and its not easy to deal with. just make sure you let them know that you are proud of them no matter what happens.

Question: when am i no longer contagious? i caught a cold then three days later developed bronchitis. i understand the cold has a three-day contagiousness window--one day before you know you are ill and two days following. but what happens when the cold develops into bronchitis? am i contagious again when the bronchitis symptoms appear? bottom line: when am i clear to return to work so i do not infect others?
Baseline Response: no, you are not contagious.
Bottom Line: when you are out of work and you are sick, your symptoms are not present.
You have a contagious disease that is contagious to others. If you are contagious to yourself, your illness is contagious. So, if you are infected with pneumonia, you must be sick. If the disease is not contagious to you, you can be contagious to anyone.
If you are a carrier of a contagious illness, you have a good chance of getting it to you. If your illness

Expected Response: most helpful answer bronchitis is just a complication of the cold. bronchitis itself is not contagious but you still should exercise caution when you cough use tissues etc. and wash your hands. you can return to work when you feel better and are fever-free since the cough can last a while.

Question: what pills can reduce stomach fat and consistant bloating. a vegetarian and gluten free but still retain stomach fat and bloating i exercise regularly and drink plenty of water. looking for help.
Baseline Response: I've been to several different diets and have found that there are several different methods of reducing stomach fat, including various types of whole grains, fruits and vegetables and some supplements.
Solution: I like to eat whole grains and I have found several ways to reduce stomach weight.
I can find some online recipes and recipes for eating whole grains but I don't have the time or the resources to try many of them. So I'm going to go for a vegan diet and try to avoid all the processed foods that I find that can make my stomach fat look like it's not the real thing.
How many calories can I burn?
Answer - 1 to 1.
This is a very important point because eating less calories will help you burn more calories.
When I say

Expected Response: part of your bloating could be caused by your protein sources. beans and other legumes can cause that so can broccoli soy plenty of vegetables. they can be good for you but you might need some probiotic help or maybe some digestive enzymes. stomach fat won't leave just because you are vegetarian. you still have to exercise regularly (like you are doing) get enough protein to be healthy limit your sugars and starches and take in fewer calories than you burn. you might want to try a different form of exercise to help kick start your fat loss too. if you increase the intensity in what you already do interval fashion you might shock your body a bit and get it working harder. bodies are famous for getting used to an exercise and burning less calories while doing it.

Question: are eating carrots bad for people who are at-risk for macular degeneration? . my eye doctors have told me that i should stay away from eating carrots since there is a long history of macular degeneration in my family. almost everyone on my mothers side has had one kind or the other. is there any truth that eating carrots could be bad for you? i like to eat carrots but i am not a nut about eating them. i may have a several small ones with dinner now and again but that's it. thanks for your time
Baseline Response: yes, carrots are good for you.
Answer #2: I had to have an auto-immune disorder for 12 months and the caries were starting to come back and they were starting up again. When i was told that they were getting worse i started to feel more sick and had to stop eating. I thought it was because i had some auto-infected food in my stomach. I have been able to eat

Expected Response: this is not something i've heard before and is not a typical diet recommendation. a variety of fruits and veggies are encouraged to help prevent macular degeneration especially leafy greens like spinach due to their high lutein content. at your next visit i suggest asking your eye doctors why they recommend no carrots so you can better understand the reasoning behind it. good luck!

Baseline Response: I have seen this happen to a lot of women, but this is a rare case. I have never had an orgasm in my life but I have been able to clean the cervix after getting pregnant.

Question: what does egfr indicate? is 52 something to worry about? . recently had a comprehensive metabolic blood panel. included creatinine 1. 07 which was indicated to be high. included egfr 52 which was indicated to be low. there is kidney disease in my family and i am wondering if these two tests are related and if they indicate a beginning of kidney disease. if so what should i do about it? can these values be changed via the diet? my age is 71. i also have high blood pressure. my bun was 24 and the bun/creatinine ratio is 22. thank you for your help.
Baseline Response: the question is simple. what is the cause of the blood pressure? it is the blood flow and the blood sugar that is being produced. this is not the cause that is causing blood pressure changes. when you look at the blood glucose, you can see that it is being converted to glucose which is then converted to fructose. what does this mean?

Expected Response: estimated glomerular filtration rate. i know (according to what i have read that when the egfr drops below 60 - it is an indication of chronic kidney disease starting - or possibly acute kidney disease if the gfr fell suddenly in response to an injury. )

Expected Response: your husband's surgery may have nothing to do with his tinnitus or high blood pressure. it may have just happened as they often do was we age. rather than search for a reason or blame see an ent to evaluate the tinnitus (the cause and cure can be very difficult to find) and his primary care doctor to treat the high blood pressure (which incidentally can be one of the hundreds of causes of tinnitus). there are sooooo many different medical issues that may be involved it would be impossible to track them down over the internet.

How often will I have symptoms?
When:
How long will I be exposed to herpes? What are the chances that I will get it?
How many times will I get it and how often do I get symptoms? Do I have to be on antiviral medications?

Expected Response: that depends on the type of herpes virus you have. after being infected people with herpes simplex virus-1 (hsv-1) tend to have far fewer and less severe outbreaks than those infected with herpes simplex virus-2 (hsv-2). both types can cause genital herpes. many people never have symptoms and don't even know they are infected. in those who do have symptoms of genital herpes how often they will appear and how long they will last varies greatly from person to person. stress illness menstruation and various other things can trigger a flare-up.

Question: last med exam 5 yrs ago this time they did blood work no abdomen or testical exam 67 yrs old do i go elsewhere. last physical 5 years ago this time no abdomen check or testical check they did do rectal exam and blood work should i go elsewhere
Baseline Response: they did check and did blood test but not rectal or testicular exams.

Expected Response: call the medical provider and ask why he (or she) did not feel an abdominal or male genital exam was not a necessary part of a "complete" physical. don't let them get away with it. the very least the medical provider should bring you back to do these components and not charge you or your insurance company one penny. there is no excuse for cutting important corners when it comes to medical care.

Baseline Response: No, no, no. It's not like that. It can't. It just doesn't work. I've been on a lot of drugs and it's just not the same. I feel like I've had a lot, a lot. I don't feel like it's going to make a difference. I just feel like there's no way it could. I'm going to go for a walk, and if I have a little bit of pain, I can go for it. I want to be able to go back and take a little pain reliever, but if I don"t feel like that, I don`t feel good. I can't go back to work, or I don't feel any better, I just don`m going to be feeling good.

Question: sometimes when i turn my neck sudden i get a very sharp pain almost like a jolt up the back of my head to my brain. i have had this jolting pain in my neck for a few years now and it only happens every now and again and only when im turning my head really fast. then i get a feeling like a jolt of electricity up the side of my neck and up my head it makes me feel blind and disoraintated for about 30 seconds. i havent really paid it much attention because after that it stops and dosent hurt but i just recently had another one and it was the worse jolt yet and its lingered in my neck now for a couple hours.
Baseline Response: when i have a jolts back i get headaches and it is very rare.

Expected Response: i'm sorry you experience this. it doesn't sound pleasant that's for sure! whenever a patient describes pain with words like "jolt of electricity " we tend to think in terms of nerve pain. only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like x-rays or mri can say for sure what's going on with your neck. that said i would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly. this type of neck pain can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae (spinal bones) of your neck. while i don't think this situation is an emergency i would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon. catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome. you can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling. hope this helps! i do that all the time. even in bed. go see a chiropractor! i wouldn't want to live without one since i started seeing one. usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes. also ice packs to the area help with the pain. this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine i am a yoga guru in india. been in the field for 12 yrs. i also have been suffering from arthritis for some time in the neck hands and low back. believe me i am not taking any medicine. i have been able to manage only with yogaanasas yoga nidra or corpe pose. you have to learn from an expert and not self learn. it is a good pain reliever. my website is srimadhwayoga. com yoga guru i have had this exact pain since i was a little girl (5 or 6). im now 18. i used to go to doctors all the time and no one ever knew what to do. it hasnt happened for about 3 years but it is now happening monthly. did you have any luck finding out what is causing this pain?

Question: can stress and anxiety cause ibs. recently had colonscopy and endoscopy everything fine. . stomach always feeling funny
Baseline Response: -
My first doctor came to my house to tell me that I had cols, but he didn�t tell me why. I didn�s to tell him, because I had a colsche

Expected Response: the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that "comes and goes. " usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were "fine" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is -- if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well!

Question: why do i keep gaining massive amounts of weight in a short period of time? . i weighed 120 most of my life. gained 40lbs. in 2 months. i lost it in about a year and then kept it off for 2 years. in the past 3 months i have gained 30lbs. my diet had not changed much. i eat a vegetable with every meal i do not eat much. the only difference was that i ate fried food/starchy food a little more often(not much of it). i did not eat enough to gain 30lbs. i am 25 years old. i have ibs gerd. i know my hormones are out of whack but never finished testing. what is wrong?
Baseline Response: I don't know. I've been taking hormones for a long time. I have never had any weight gain or loss. I'm not sure what my body is doing. I feel like I'm eating right now. i'm trying to lose weight.

Expected Response: i can't really offer you a patient-specific answer over the internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue. you do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weight-control specialist (baritrician). you are eating more than you body needs. this is the only way (other than water retention) that a mammal (you) can put on large amounts of weight. we do not pull calories from the air. while it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only 500 calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale; a 1000 calorie a day increase could at two pounds a week. the first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary. write down everything you eat including the amounts/weight and their determine their caloric content. your doctor will likely need this information. it is important that you burn the calories that you take in. this may be something that you fail to do. you may speak with dr. schweiger a board certified dermatologist who can help you with an effective way to reduce unwanted body fats.

Question: i am a 30 year old male and have to urinate ~20 times/day. it is especially bad as i go to bed and right as i wake up. i do not wake up in the middle of the night to pee but when i'm lying down to sleep i feel an almost constant need to pee even immediately after doing so. this has been going on for a long while likely over a year. i am otherwise completely healthy. and am not taking any medication. some nights are worse than others but most involve getting up to pee at least 3 times from when i lie down to sleep until when i actually fall asleep. the worst nights i may have to pee up to 10 times.
Baseline Response: i'm in the habit of peeing about 2 hours before bedtime. i usually do this for about 4 hours each night and then bed. my pee is usually in the morning and i use a regular schedule to pee the next day. i have a tendency to pee when

Expected Response: frequency of urination needs a medical investigation including an examination and blood/urine tests to rule out diabetes mellitus. see your primary care care provider first. if your tests are normal then you will need to see a urologist. this problem can be fixed but a cause will need to be medically-determined first.
================================================================================
Question: what is a good evening routine for skin care?
Baseline Response: The answer is usually "it depends" and you can use the routine for what you need to do. In order to make a good night's routine, it is important to have a good morning routine. This is because most people are not very happy with their daily routine. For example, you might feel that your skin is too dry and you feel that it is too tired. In addition, you may feel that you are getting sick because you have been working on your skin. You might feel anxious because you feel like you are working on yourself and you are feeling like you have no idea what to do, or you might want to go to a doctor or get your doctor's opinion.
It is important that you use the routines that you need. There are many different routines that are available. Some people will use these routines for a number of reasons. Some will use them for the purpose of getting better at the routine

Expected Response: wash use a toner if you like using toners. i would recommend looking for one that is alcohol-free. then apply a night cream ideally containing retinol.

Question: i have pain in the upper-outside part of my right heel. can this be caused by driving and resting my heel on the floor?
Baseline Response: yes. It is very possible that your foot is being stuck in a position where the ball of your foot may be on the ground. This is known as a 'dumb foot' or 'dummy foot'. In this case, the ball has been hit by your foot and is now stuck in the ground below your heel.

Expected Response: sounds plausible to me. after all a number of nerves run up the back of the heel. if you drive frequently and compress those nerves they could give you pain. you might consider wearing a shoe with more cushioning to avoid this problem. some people favor driving moccasins. whatever helps to get the pressure off those nerves. hope you feel better!

Question: can a 55 year old white male get a sore throat from advair disks?
Baseline Response: yes, and yes. I've been told that it's not uncommon for a white male to have sore throats from advairs.
But I've never had a sore nose or throat from the advair, and I never had an advair from a white guy.
Answer
I think the white guy who was getting sore throat at the time is probably not the only white guy getting sore throats. I'm sure there are others who have sore throat, but I have never had sore throat.
I'm sure the white guys who got sore throats were getting sore noses from the adjair. I think the nomenclature is a little weird.
So, when you get sore throat you usually get sore nose. The white guy gets sore nose from advail disks.
You get sore noses because you've never used advair.
And it's a little bit like the

Expected Response: many things can cause a sore throat so don't just assume it is the advair. this is not a common side-effect but it is possible.

Question: what causes osteoporosis?
Baseline Response: osteopors are not the same as osteoporosus. They are the same. They do not have the same function. They have the function of a muscle, but the function is not the muscle itself. The same is true of the nerves. The nerves are the most important part of the body. They control your body's movements.
If you are doing a lot of exercise or a lot inactivity, the nerves will not be functioning properly. You may have some kind of pain or something. It is not a problem.

Expected Response: with age bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin. for women the loss of bone density speeds up during the first five to seven years after menopause when there is a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. factors that increase a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis include: being thin or having a small frame. having a family history of osteoporosis. having the ovaries removed. smoking drinking more than moderately or living a sedentary lifestyle. white and asian women are more frequently affected than african-american and hispanic women. certain medical conditions such as kidney disease cushing's syndrome and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid gland increase bone breakdown. glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory drugs) anti-seizure drugs and prolonged immobility due to paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss.

Baseline Response: no. the only way to prevent infection is to get up in the morning.
Answer #2: the best thing you can do to prevent bacteria from spreading is to wash your hands thoroughly and thoroughly before you go to bed. do this on your hands every morning. in addition to washing your hands, you can use the following to wash up your hands before you sleep:
1) If you have vaginal symptoms, you should be able to get an antibiotic.

Question: would it be pointless to visit a doctor years after contracting lyme disease? . i was bitten by a tick a few years ago and was left with the bullseye rash that signifies lyme disease but i didn't see a doctor because i didn't know about the disease. i've had some symptoms that i suppose could be related (wrist pain muscle aches trouble sleeping) but would it be worth going now that my symptoms are so vague?
Baseline Response: no. lyme is a very serious disease that is spreading around the world and can be transmitted by any person who has a history of lyme. The problem is that lyme has not been reported to the WHO.

Question: how effective are male condoms at birth control?
Baseline Response: Male condoms are the most effective way to prevent STDs. They prevent STIs by preventing the formation of a condom. They are also more effective than condoms because they do not have the same amount of lubrication and the same lubrication as condoms.
What is the difference between male condoms and female condoms?
Male condoms have the most lubrication. Female condoms have less.
How do they differ?
Female condoms have a lot more lubrication than male condoms. They have less than one or two more times the amount of blood or sperm in a female condom. The more the sperm, the more likely it is to develop an infection. This is because the more semen in a male condom, the less likely it will become infected.
Male and female condom use is similar in terms of number of condoms used. However, the difference in condom use can be as large as 5%.
How does the difference occur?

Expected Response: condoms are about 85% effective for birth control. with careful use they are even more effective. keep in mind that the best way to avoid getting pregnant is to not have sex (abstinence).

Question: can a child get sickle cell trait from their grandparents or great grandparents if their parents dont have it? . my first son was born with sickle cell trait and i was wondering if it was possible to have gotten it from someone else other than his parents. i know i don't have it but my husband has no clue. so i was wondering if it deffenatly came from my husband or possibly the childs grandparents or great grandparents.
Baseline Response: I was born in a very poor family. my parents are poor, and my grandparents are poor. I was a child born with a sickle disease. My parents were poor, but my great grandparents were poor. My father was in a bad situation and had to move to a better place. I had to go to school, work, and eat. My mother lived on a food stamp program. I don't remember what she had to say. I never had a sickling disease. I have been diagnosed with it.

Expected Response: sickle cell trait is a genetic disorder that occurs when a child inherits one sickle cell gene from a parent. if a child inherits two sickle cell genes (one from each parent) then that child will have sickle cell disease. so to answer your question if your son has been diagnosed with sickle cell trait then he had to have inherited a sickle cell gene from one of his parents. if you his mother know positively you don't have sickle cell trait (which is diagnosed by blood test) then your son must have received the gene from his father. sickle cell trait may never produce symptoms so you should not assume you don't have it unless you've been tested for it. your son needs to be aware that he can pass along this sickle cell gene to his own child. if the child's mother also has sickle cell trait (or sickle cell disease) the child can be born with sickle cell disease. hope this helps!

Question: the first day of my last period was 11/22/13. is it too soon to take a pregnancy test?
Baseline Response: yes. However, the first month of pregnancy is the time you should wait to have your doctor take a test before taking a pregnancy medication. You can test by taking a urine sample, but this will take up to three days. You should be able to take your first test by the time your baby is born. If you are pregnant after 11/2/13, your doctor will need to confirm your pregnancy with your health care provider.
Answer 2: you can have a test done at the same time.
3: you should get a test for the first time after the first week of pregnancy.
4: you will need a blood test for your birth.
5: you need to get a urine test before you can start taking the medication.
6: if you do not get a blood sample after 11-2-13,

Expected Response: i do not know the spacing of your cycles or anything about your sexual practices or medical history but i would say that a few days late on your period would be a bit early. while some pregnancy tests can be accurate this soon i think you really want a accurate result. wait a week or so.

Question: can you swim if you have shingles?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure. I can swim but I'm afraid I'm too small.
Answer : you can swim
Answer the next time you see me
I am a swimmer but I have shingle. I have a good chance of getting shingle but I can't swim because I have something that is too big.
I have a bad chance of shingling.
The shingle I got was too big and I thought it would help me to swim but then I got sick of it and I started swimming again.
My last swim was a 3.5 mile run and I went to the hospital. I am a swimmers swimmer and I have done well.
If you are not afraid of shingle and you are a swim player then you are probably not a swimplayer. I would say you are only a swim swimmer if you are afraid of that.

Question: what are side effects after liposuction. pink color patches on the skin round liposuction
Baseline Response: It may be as simple as that. It can happen in any way that you can imagine, but it is a very minor problem that can be fixed. I am not sure how it can be prevented, but I think it is best to look into it first.
I will go over this in more detail in a future post, but for now, let's just assume that you have a very large amount of liposomes. If you have no liposome at all, then you will probably be a very small person with no lipo-skin.
Do not worry, I will not be taking care of you.
What do you think? Are you ready for liposuch?

Expected Response: liposuction is generally considered safe but people should understand there are now several different "flavors" of liposuction. these include traditional "tumescent" liposuction non-invasive cryoliposuction (cool lipo) and laser liposuction. the answer to your question depends a bit on what type of liposuction you had done. if you had traditional (tumescent) liposuction in which fluid was injected under your skin before the fat being sucked out with a metal wand called a cannula then pinkness around the cannula sites may not be unusual. if the pink spots are near the incision sites this also may simply be normal bruising. with traditional liposuction there is always some level of bruising to the treated areas afterwards. because you have questions about these pink patches i'd suggest you call the surgeon who performed your liposuction procedure to find out what's going on. he or she is in the best position to tell you if you're experiencing normal healing or if something else is going on. wishing you all the best! hello this is really a good question here we have some of the most common side effects of liposuction: scars swelling bruises pain reduced mobility just to make it clear side effects differ from complications in the fact that the side effects always take place after an invasive liposuction surgery while complication may never appear! as for the pink patches can you please tell me which liposuction technique did you opt for (tumescent ultrasonic laser etc) for more info on the side effects have a look here: <link>#side_effects

Question: what can i do to treat bipolar disorder in childhood and adolescence at home?
Baseline Response: I'm a parent, and I've been told by many psychiatrists that there is a significant risk of bipolar disorder among children. The answer is that it's not clear what the risk is. I believe that it is a very important concern.
I think that if you look at the research of the last few years, there are several studies that show that children who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder develop symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses, and they also show a significant number of their parents are taking medications.
It's not that there's no risk for bipolar disorder; it's that it can be very serious for children. But there is no one study that has shown that bipolar disorder is a risk factor for schizophrenia in children.
There is no clear evidence that bipolar depression is an underlying illness. What I have seen is that some of the studies that I have read have found that

Expected Response: there are steps you can take at home to reduce your child's symptoms of bipolar disorder. keep your child's room quiet and have your child go to bed at the same time every night. control the amount of stress in your child's life. you may need to seek ways to help your child reduce academic requirements during severe mood swings. learn to recognize the early warning signs of your child's manic and depressive mood episodes. steps your child can take to help control moods include: getting enough exercise. during a depressive episode your child may feel like doing only gentle exercises such as taking a walk or swimming. getting enough sleep and keeping a consistent sleep schedule. eating a balanced diet. avoiding the use of alcohol or drugs. substance abuse makes bipolar disorder worse. avoiding beverages that contain caffeine including coffee tea colas and energy drinks. learning to recognize the early warning signs of manic and depressive mood episodes. asking for help from friends and family when needed. bipolar disorder in children: helping your child prevent manic episodes for some children with bipolar disorder depression can cause debilitating symptoms. for information about managing childhood depression see the topic depression in children and teens. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what conditions does penicillin g pot in dextrose treat?

Question: can i bring my 88 year old father who has stage iv copd to denver where the altitude is 5500 feet. i would like my dad to come live his last days out with me. i certainly don't want to be the cause of his death but he is miserable where he is. is it worth the risk? we have an excellent oxygen concentrator that gives him a good pulse burst and he does breathing treatments. he wouldn't have to do anything that would cause over exertion. is it worth the risk?
Baseline Response: no.
Answer to

Expected Response: you ask a fascinating question and one that is very worthy of discussing with your dad's physician. i tried to search for some relevant studies on this topic and did not find very many. in general people with copd do worse at high altitudes whether they have lived at altitude for a long term or not. the issues with ventilation at altitude are more complex than simple oxygen delivery. there also are issues of breathing mechanics and heart function that come into play. all of this is not to say you should not move your dad to be with you in denver. i'm saying it could be manageable if you discuss it in advance with some good doctors and learn what things you need to do to manage your dad's condition at high altitude. or you might both decide the risks are too great. my personal opinion is that quality of life matters more than quantity of life -- especially when a person reaches an advanced age. i would suggest you consult with your father's doctor (or with a physician in denver) to find out if the benefits for your dad would outweigh the risks. wishing you well!

Question: is there anything in the law that will help patients with chronic conditions better afford their medications?
Baseline Response: the law does not provide a remedy for patients with acute conditions. The law does provide a solution for patients. The medical community must make sure that those who have a chronic condition can afford their medication.
The law does create a system of support and support for those who are suffering from chronic conditions.
In the past, there was no law that could help patients. Today, there are several law that can help patients and their families with chronic diseases.
If you have a problem with a medication, ask your doctor about it. It will help you get the medication you need.
A patient's medical history is important to understand. You may need to change your medication. You will need to have a prescription for your medication and it may not be available in your area. If you have diabetes, it may be difficult to find a doctor who can prescribe your medication for you.

Expected Response: it's important to look closely at each plan's drug benefits. it will take a little bit of work but choosing the right plan based on the medications you take could save a lot of money. all the health plans offered will provide prescription drug coverage. however not all plans are the same. each state will cover various medications differently. that's why it's important to do your best to match up your medicines with the right plan for you. your doctor may also help you pick a plan that's likely to cover any medicines you may need in the future. however like many of us doctors are learning about the new law and what it covers as we go. webmd has an excellent article that can provide more information on presciption drug costs and health reform.

Question: can saline solution be used in nostrils while there is greenish discharge?
Baseline Response: Yes, it is possible to get greenish nasal discharge through the use of saline solution in the nostrils, but the nasal discharge is not produced by the nasal filter.
The nasal discharge produced by a saline solution is more likely to be produced by air in the nasal cavity. In this case, the nasal nasal filter should be opened.
This can be done by inserting a needle into the nostril, which is attached to the nose of the patient and the needle is directed into the nasal canal. The needle is placed into the mouth of the child and the child is told to inhale. The child is then given a nasal fill and is then asked to swallow the nasal fill. The fill is then washed and then given to the child.
If the child does not swallow the fill, the patient will be given a new nasal fill containing saline solution.
These nasal fillings are the

Expected Response: kidney stones usually show themselves through some specific symptoms though they only way to diagnose them for sure is through one or several tests such as a ct scan. if you're having any of these symptoms it's worth seeking medical attention: urge to urinate frequently possibly with little urine output sharp pains in the flanks or lower abdomen sometimes radiating toward the groin pacing the floor due to pain and the inability to find a comfortable position to sit or lie down in blood in the urine nausea and/or vomiting with the flank pain these are the classic signs of a kidney stone though other conditions can cause similar symptoms. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a mild-to-moderate basis you'd do well to make an appointment with your primary care provider. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a severe basis or if you find yourself nearly unable to urinate then a trip to urgent care or the emergency room is in order. only a health care provider can say for sure if you have kidney stones. i wish you well!

Question: does a migraine always include pain or can you just have light sensitivity?
Baseline Response: I believe that some people experience light sensitivity and that they have migraine headaches. This is not something you can do as a doctor. You can simply ask yourself: Is the pain just a symptom of a migraine or is it something that is a sign of a more serious condition?
It is not a diagnosis, but a symptom. If you have a migraine, there is a lot of information available to help you with this.
If you do not have a doctor's diagnosis, you should not be diagnosed with a migraine.
You may need to take a headache test.
The best way to learn about migraine is through a migraine course.
Do not try to avoid taking a migraine test. You may find that you are more likely to have a headache if you take a migraine than if you don't take a test. It's not because you are having a migraine but because you have one or

Baseline Response: my type is a vegan, gluten free, vegan, vegan. I have a very low carb, low carb diet and i'm happy to share my recipes.

Expected Response: it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian diets—ones that include eggs and dairy –or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat diet—just don’t go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website <link> also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.

Question: when is your blood pressure to low? and when is your pulse to high? . i was recently put on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. i am concerned because i am staying tired and sleepy. i keep a check on my blood pressure but would like to know what is considered to low. also my pulse rate ranges from 70's to 90's. has hit 100 and 103 a couple times. what is a safe pulse rate?
Baseline Response: a safe, safe pulse is a high-frequency pulse that is not a "normal" pulse. i have not heard of any case where a person has died while on a lisin opril. i feel like i have to stay awake to be able to get my pulse to 100%. if i can't get a pulse to 103 i can just go back to sleep and be at 100.
Answer that it is safe to go back up to 100% and a good chance to get a good pulse. the reason

Expected Response: you're wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for high blood pressure. doing this will help your health care provider titrate (fine-tune) your medication dosage appropriately. clinically low blood pressure is defined as anything under 90/60. (this can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual. ) if you've been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 90/60 as being too low. a normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. it's not unusual for a person's heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise. if you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider. because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment. there are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isn't working for you your doctor can try something else. i wish you all the best!

I am not on a private insurance plan. I have insurance from a company called CoveredHealth, I have a Covered plan from my doctor and i'm not able access a medical doctor's prescription. so they don' know about me or my coverage.
So I'm very interested in seeing what they have to

Expected Response: it is true that not all providers will be participating in all the plans offered through the marketplace. one of the ways insurance companies operate is by only contracting with providers who are willing to accept their terms. you may want to change providers to one who is in one of the plans offered in the marketplace. if you do not want to change plans you should compare what kind of out-of-network coverage each of the plans offers.

Question: how can i keep my lips moist? they’re too dry.
Baseline Response: you have to use an airtight, natural latex glove. the latex glove is made of latex, which is made from a latex resin. this latex is the latex that is used to seal the lips.
I have tried it on my lips and it worked fine. I also had to use a very special latex glove to prevent the lips from drying out.
You can get a latex glove from any store or online. I am a big fan of latex gloves. I don't use latex gloves on my face, hands or even my feet, because they are too slippery and I get cold. But when you are trying to find a latex mask, try these latex masks.
The latex mask is made out of latex. It has a very soft rubber lining. It is very slippery and it has a rubber band on top. It's very thin and you can use it to cover your face

Expected Response: for simply dry lips use an emollient that contains a sunblock. for cases of resistant dehydrated lips you may apply an over-the-counter hydrocortisone ointment (not cream) to your lips.

Question: i have to force myself to eat i havent ate much in a week. so far this week i have ate a half bowl of oatmeal two sandwiches and some fries and its thursday my parents are worried i think and so am i. i am overweight and 13 so could it be my brain saying "hey fatty stop eating"? any help would be much appreciated! thanks
Baseline Response: I have been trying to eat a bowl of Oatmeal for the last 3 days and i am still not able to find any results. I have tried to get some oats in the morning but they have been hard to find and i cant find any. so i am trying to get as much oatmeal as i can get. and now its time to try to eat some oatmeal. i just have to try and find out what is going on.
Answer. I've been trying for 2 days now and i have not found any results (except for the occasional bite of Oats). so far

Expected Response: be happy of your body but also believe it is what you make of it! not eating is not a reaction by your brain instead eating is encouraged in order to meet the vitamins nutrients and protein your body needs to get through the day and promotes brain functions. not eating can also cause problems to the functions of your hypothalamus. if there has been any new medications in your regimen maybe that is a problem. i would encourage an exercise program as it has helped me in a daily routine of eating. exercise is necessary among individuals whether you are overweight or not due to the release of endorphins which is food for your brain and makes you feel better. i was able to trim 6% body fat in 3 months due to a steady exercise program of 6 days a week and i am even eating 5 meals a day to keep my calorie intake high. i would suggest the first week starting slower with 3 days a week in order to loosen your muscles. stretching is also a very important key to a successful workout in which should be done before and after. the best advice is to not give up on yourself. losing weight and eating healthy takes time to adjust but noticing results will help your morale and motives on a daily basis. your diet is the most important thing and needs adjusting in a more strict regimen of what and when to eat. if you begin exercising running for a half hour will burn roughly 300-500 calories depending on speed. keep in mind that is simply a large fry from mcdonalds. completely cut all of those greasy foods out and begin eating healthier to feel better. boosting metabolism is a great way to start so drinking a coffee or green tea in the morning is a great way to do so. no soda. milk is necessary for calcium but stay away from the fats! try almond milk for lower fat content and higher calcium water is a great thing to drink as it keeps you hydrated and well. breakfast: possible one-a-day for key nutrients and vitamins otherwise get cereal with vitamins and nutrients. my favorite is post grape nuts which has a lot of the vitamins required for a daily intake along with protein. oatmeal is also another good way to jump start your day. eggs are a great breakfast food for the proteins and omega-3. lunch: my personal go to is a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread greek yogurt and banana. tuna fish sandwich is also a good lunch meal dinner: be creative! pasta and chicken that is not breaded is very good for glutamine and starch for energy. quinoa is my personal favorite as it contains every essential amino acid (really good cooked in chicken brother instead of water). rice is another good one and i also prefer fish. these foods and more such as split peas and soy beans will help you keep a healthy balanced diet which will lower your sugar and saturated fat intake. i really hope this helps as it has changed my life greatly!

Question: is it possible to receive nerve damage from a finger prick blood collection?
Baseline Response: No. The skin is not completely transparent. However, there are some small spots in the skin that can cause nerve damage. These areas are called "muscle" areas.
In order to obtain the correct nerve damage, there is no skin treatment for the affected area. However there are several methods of skin removal. These are called surgical procedures, such as the use of a laser.
There are also various types of surgical procedures that are done in order to remove nerve damage that can be caused by a finger-picks.
These are:
- Nerve removal in the mouth.
- Removal of the skin from the nose by a surgical procedure.
Such procedures can also be performed in order for the skin to be removed.
This is also known as "surgical" or "surgery".
In addition, these procedures can be done on a daily basis.
What

Expected Response: not very likely. a finger prick is done at the peripheral end of the finger pad so there are few nerves that are located here. i can hurt yes but true nerve damage would be very unlikely.

Question: how long until z-pack works for strep? started yesterday and throat is still hurting bad. i'm allergic to penicillin so was prescribed a z-pack. i took the two pills yesterday morning took dose two (one pill) today. i know it's only been one day but i was of course hoping it would magically disappear. i haven't had strep since i was a child and this has been absolutely miserable.
Baseline Response: i was on a trip and had to get home and got the prescription for streptomycin and i was taking it at the time of my trip. the medicine was not very effective and i felt like I had a bad headache. i was worried that i would get a bad rash on my face but i didn't think it was that bad. now i'm back to normal and hope it won't kill me.
The only thing that is bothering me is that my stomach is getting used to my medications. i have a bad

Expected Response: most helpful answer the medical provider who is treating you for strep is not really doing it correctly. if you do a brief search on "treating strep with azithromycin" you will see that the standard z-pack is not sufficient. strep should be treated with two pills (500mg) every day for five days; twice the dose you have been given. the purpose of any antibiotic in the treatment of lab-diagnosed strep (i hope you had a confirmation test to prove you did indeed have strep) is to prevent complications. not to treat the associated pain. antibitoics are not good pain medications so i would suggest that you take an appropriate dose of ibuprofen or have your medical provider prescribe something for you.
================================================================================
Question: can i get the shingles vaccine if i have a cold?
Baseline Response: yes, no, or no.
No, you will need to have a specific allergy to the shingle to get the vaccine.
If you are allergic to shingle, you can get the SHINGLE vaccine. Shingle vaccines are not available in Canada.
Shingles are an extremely rare disease.
The vaccine does not cure shingling.
You will need the shindig vaccine. This is the only vaccine available in the United States.
I have been receiving shingled shingle for 2 years now and I can tell you that I have never had shingle.
It is the most common disease in my family.
In the United Kingdom, there is a vaccine available for shingletons.
This vaccine is not available to you.
There is no shingler vaccine available to me.
Please see the link below for the list

Expected Response: if it's a mild cold yes. but if you are moderately or severely ill wait until you recover.

Question: how do l deal with pain from gall bladder infection or gallstones
Baseline Response: This is the most common and most common gall bladder infections. The most common cause of gall bladder disease is gallstones.
What are the symptoms of gallstones?
The symptoms of the gallstone are:
1. Chest pain
2. Bleeding
3. Fluid retention
4. Bladder pain
5. Lymphatic or urinary discharge
6. Chest discharge
7. Stomach pain
8. Lung pain
9. Pain in the chest
10. Pain from the lumbar spine
11. Pain of the head
12. Pain related to the lungs
13. Pain associated with the bladder
14. Pain caused by the bladder itself
15. Pain due to the bladder's internal organs
16. Pain resulting from the internal organs, such as the liver
17. Pain experienced during exercise or in sports
18. Pain when exercising
19

Expected Response: i'm not sure from your question if you've been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if you're self-diagnosing. it's important to know. gallstones can be very painful. if stones accumulate or block the bile duct surgery must be performed to remove the gallbladder. it is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder. if you only suspect your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain. many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. if your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage. i'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your abdomen. that's never fun. wishing you well!

Question: what are the muscles that make up my butt?
Baseline Response: the muscles in my butt are called the "muscle."
There are three types of muscles: the "butt muscles," the "girdle muscles," and the "upper body muscles." The muscles are:
The "butt muscle" is a muscle that attaches to my butt, and the muscles of my upper body are:


The lower body muscles are the "skeletons" that are attached to my thighs.


In the lower body, the "big toe" muscles are attached.

 (The "little toes" are attached.)

In my butt muscles, I have the "belly" muscles that are a little smaller than my butt.

What do the muscles do?

The muscles that I have attached to the butt muscles are a lot like my belly muscles. They are attached just like my butt muscle.
.



What are the nerves that

Expected Response: your behind is made up of three muscles that comprise the glutes: gluteus maximus -- the largest glute and one of the strongest muscles in the human body; then gluteus minimus and medius. it’s the maximus that gives your bottom its shape and is integral to almost every movement we take. the glutes are covered by a layer of subcutaneous fat. how much fat you carry is dictated by genetics as well as lifestyle.
================================================================================
Question: could a pregnancy be possible with an iud and a vasectomy together?
Baseline Response: the vasectomy would be a combination of both the two.
Answer 1: If your doctor recommends a vasectomies, you can also have one or both of them done at the same time.
The difference is that the vasectomy will help you get rid of the virus.
Solution: do not have a vasovagectomy and do not do an iUD.
If you want to have a single vasectomy, you need to have an abortion.
But, the procedure is very expensive and it is not recommended.
I hope you like my blog and I will see you in the future.
Thank you for reading.
-Linda

Expected Response: hi only if the iud was loose and the vasectomy was just a few days before or within the 6 weeks of having it. but otherwise cant see how with the vas its nil sperm so that should be the end of your question. good luck

Baseline Response: yes. i have a case of a cat that has had an eye surgery. i was wondering if there is an option for an artificial eyes.
I would like the following to be a possible option:
1. My cat has had surgery to remove the retina.
2. My eye surgery has been successful.

Question: should a oral surgeon remove impacted wisdom teeth if the patient has a sinus infection. what are the risks if they do it?
Baseline Response: the patient is not likely to need treatment for any disease or condition. The risk of infection is minimal.
The patient is likely to require treatment for a variety of diseases and conditions. A diagnosis of sinusitis is important. If the patient does not need treatment, a surgical procedure should be performed.
What is the risk of a sinum infection in a patient with a sinuitis?
The risk of sinumitis is an unknown risk. A sinus is an infection in the sinus that occurs when the patient's sinus gland is damaged. The patient may have a sinuit or other obstruction, but a sinal obstruction may be a sign of infection.
If the patient had a sinura in the right side of his or her sinus, the patient may be at risk of having a sinuous sinus

Expected Response: no dentist or dr. should do any major work on you if your are sick. that's very serious.
================================================================================
Question: is there a federal requirement to test tissue removed from a benign lesion?
Baseline Response: yes.

Expected Response: i am not exactly sure if i understand your question but i do not believe there are any federal regulations that require a medical provider to test tissue removed from a lesion however it is common sense to do so. the only way to know with certainty if a removed or biopsied lesion is benign or malignant is to send it to pathology for a microscopic analysis so most medical providers do this as a standard of care practice not because of any federal requirement.
================================================================================
Question: how is a cataract treated?
Baseline Response: a catalactist is trained to treat cats with an antibiotic to prevent the infection. The cat is then given antibiotics to treat other infections.
The cat is also given a veterinary antibiotic for the treatment of other infections such as infections of the liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, stomach, and throat.
When a cat is treated, the cat is given a treatment kit containing antibiotics and a food source. The food source is given to the cat at the end of the treatment. The treatment kit is then delivered to the patient at the clinic. The veterinarian then removes the cat from the food source and carries it home to the clinic for further treatment.
If the cat has a fever and it is not taken care of by the veterinarian, the pet is not cared for.
There is no other treatment available for the cat. The patient is taken to the vet's office to be assessed for the infection and if

Expected Response: the symptoms of early cataract may be improved with new eyeglasses brighter lighting anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. if these measures do not help surgery is the only effective treatment. surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. a cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities such as driving reading or watching tv. you and your eye care professional can make this decision together. sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. for example a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. if you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times usually four to eight weeks apart.

Baseline Response: No, my normal cycles last 4-6 days. I had to have an ultrasound on the 19th to confirm this, but I did not have a chance to try it on my own, so I decided to take a pregnancy test on the 20th. I was told by the doctor that I should get a CT scan on the 21st and the CT scan was positive, so my cycle was confirmed on the 22nd. on the 23rd I was informed by the OB/GYN that my cycle should be normal on the 24th.

Expected Response: hi take it your not on bc? well the only thing you can do is get to your doctor and get a test done there this way you will know for sure. or it could be just a skipped period these do happen. good luck

Question: i had unprotected sex with a woman and literally the day after i felt a dull pain on the tip of my penis. it's not bad mostly irritating and makes me readjust all the time. doesn't burn when i pee or anything and don't see any redness or topical issues. i've been reading that you should wait a few months before getting tested for anything so i thought i would check here in the meantime. any ideas? can i rule out anything in my mind?
Baseline Response: yes but i think it's important to check the results before going for testing. If you are taking the test and don' get any problems, the first thing to do is ask yourself what the problem is. If it's a minor problem, then it's probably not a major one. If the problem you're having is a little more serious, then you may want to start checking your blood pressure. If there's a lot of blood in your system, you may not want to go

Expected Response: hi it could be just your mind working overtime and if your stressing that would not help you its 8 weeks to getting a test for std's at a gum clinic that would be your best bet to go to. try just calming down it will go away then and think just normal thoughts ok good luck

Question: what is the relation between high blood pressure and high heart/pulse rate? . i have read that when the volume of blood is high the bp rises and the pulse slows down and vice versa however in my case the bp rises when when pulse rate increases. can you please explain this relation in bp and pulse in detail. . . . thanks. . . . osman
Baseline Response: my bp is about 100 beats per minute. if my heart rate is high then I'm going to be in a very weak state. If my heart is very low then I can only be in this state for a few minutes. If I am in this condition for a long period of time then I'll be in the state I'm in for a short period of my life. . .. .
Answer to question from Mr. Dr. G.W.K.A. (Mr. Dr.): I am a diabetic. My bp for the first 3 months of life

Expected Response: osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: " a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. " other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful.

Question: how long does it take to show symtoms after having intercourse with someone who has genitle herpes? . also if they haven't had a outbreak in 5-10 years and show no signs of the disease can you still get it? lastly can you get the disease from oral sex if they have no symptoms?
Baseline Response: I would like to know how long it takes to show symptoms of genitle as well. If you have no signs or symptoms then you will probably need to wait a couple of years before you can get the virus.
A few months before you have had sex with someone else you will likely have herpes. I have never had genitle and it was a few months ago. I am very concerned that the virus is still present in your body.
I have had a few friends who had the same thing and I can tell you that it is not a serious illness but it is something you should be worried about.
If you are concerned about this you

Expected Response: there is no easy or definitive answer. expose to someone with active (visible fresh lesions) herpes the outbreak on the exposed person can be relatively fast. when genital herpes is dormant (no visible signs of the disease) the chance of exposure is considerably less but unfortunately not zero. many people who have contracted herpes were not aware that their partner was infected and ended up contracting it in this dormant stage so we do know that this virus can be shed even when lesions are not present.
================================================================================
Question: are there special things you should do to protect your teeth when you have braces but grind your teeth?
Baseline Response: yes.
You can't grind your tooth with your hands.
Do you need to grind your gum or teeth with your teeth but not your teeth if you have a tooth implant or toothpaste?
You should grind your mouth with your mouth, but not with your tooth.
When you get your dentist's permission to grind, you should grind it with your tongue.
If you grind your tongue, you may be able to use your teeth for dental work, but you should not grind your jaw with your nose.
What do you do if you are having a bad tooth?
If your dentist has a good tooth, you can grind it using your tongue and use your tongue for dental works.
How do I get dental work done?
Once you have dental work completed, you will be able use your mouth and teeth for oral work.
After you

Expected Response: most patients in braces that continue to grind can wear a special nighttime appliance to protect their teeth. i would discuss this with the orthodontist treating you with braces.

Question: does cipro cause weight gain?
Baseline Response: yes, and it is a good idea to start with a diet that has low-carb and protein.
The idea is that you can get leaner and healthier without consuming too much carbohydrate or fat. This is a very common idea and one that I have heard from people who are getting off on their low-fat diets.
You will notice that the more protein you have, the better your weight gain.
There are several factors that can contribute to weight gain, but I would like to focus on the one that is most important, protein. I am not going to go into too much detail here, but as a general rule, I tend to be a lot of protein-dense. I'm not a big fan of high-protein diets, so I feel like I should focus more on protein. The only reason I'm doing this is because I know that I can get off on my low-protein diet if

Expected Response: no. using this antibiotic will have no effect on weight gain.

Question: why can't i ejaculate? . i'm 22 years old. i recently had chronic prostatitis and my urine flow was blocked. i had to get a foley catheter. it was removed 2 days ago. it feels like i'm going to ejaculate but nothing comes out.
Baseline Response: i don't know why. i just don't want to.

Expected Response: you will need to see your urologist. you could be having retrograde ejaculations. this is where the ejaculation goes into the bladder instead of out of the end of your penis. this could be due to the chronic prostatitis that blocked your urine flow.
================================================================================
Question: is it best to take vitamins a b c & e individually or is there a single product containing these?
Baseline Response: It depends. There are many different vitamins and minerals in the body. For example, it is best to consume whole grains, whole fruits, whole vegetables, whole grains and whole beans, whole nuts, whole leafy vegetables, and whole fish. Some of these vitamins and nutrients are found in the stomach, intestines, kidneys, and intestines. Some are found on the skin and some in the blood. In addition, some of these are found throughout the body, including the kidneys, liver, kidneys and liver. In general, if you take the recommended amount of a particular vitamin, it can be beneficial. However, if your body does not have enough vitamin B12, it may not have sufficient vitamin B6, B12+ and B12-rich foods.
I am very concerned about the health risks of taking vitamin B vitamins. I have found that

Expected Response: almost any high-quality multivitamin will contain all of these vitamins. you can simply take one tablet to get them all. if you need help choosing the right multivitamin for you consult your pharmacist. and don't forget to eat a healthy diet. i'm not against taking vitamin pills but this should only be to supplement the vitamins you get from food. food contains essential micronutrients you can't get from pills and food also contains the fiber your body needs for digestion. wishing you well!

Question: dark reddish brown vaginal bleeding green stools and a dull achy feeling in my pelvic and stomach area. my menstrual cycle isn't consistent and i can go months without having it. i am on birth control though a condom hasn't been used for sex. instead the pull-out method has been used. when my last set of birth control ended i did not start my period i just had very very light bleeding. and i missed one day on my new set but got caught back up the next day. i did notice the bleeding did occur after this happened.
Baseline Response: i didn't have any bleeding during my period. it was just a small amount of blood. i was feeling pretty good but after this i had some feeling of pain. the pain was quite slight but it was the biggest pain i had ever had. when i went to get the last set I was on a little bit of a rush and then i heard a knock at the door. i didn´t know

Expected Response: hi i think you should either see your doctor or gyno but depending how long you have been on bc pills it may be time to take a couple of months off but using condoms for any kind of sex your having. its like taking a bc holiday you should hopefully get a couple of periods doing this and this should clear out your uterus in case you have a backlog it may even take 3 months if you don't have a period the first month. but see what your doctor or gyno says. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: does osteoarthritis cause cartilidge in your nose to disappear or become less. my friend has noticed that in the last few weeks that the cartilage in her nose ears and toes has become obsolete. she suffers with fibromyalgia and has a had a full hysterectomy. she does not take any hormone replacement and she is in her mid 40's. in addition she has never had a bone scan. any help?
Baseline Response: it is not possible to know for sure how much cartilage is missing in your cartilage. if it is at all, it is likely that it is due to a degenerative disease. the problem is that the bone and cartilage are not in perfect harmony. it is a matter of how many cartilage there are in the same tissue and it is only in the area that is missing. the most important thing is that you have a clear idea of what you are missing. if you do not have a bone or cartilage

Expected Response: get your friend checked up and x-ray scan done to rule out the condition she is suffering from. osteoarthritis does lead to brittle bone but not a obsolete loss of bone structure.

Question: i've heard that pharmaceutical companies sometimes offer discounts on drugs. how would i get access to those discounts?
Baseline Response: I can provide you with a list of the discounts that they offer.
Answer #1:
I have a pharmacy that sells a lot of drugs for a certain price. I can't say where they sell them, but I can say that they sell drugs that are the same price as the other drugs that they have.
Solution #2:
If you want to get a discount, I can explain it to you.
Problem #1.
The best way to get the discount is by looking at your prescriptions. If you have a doctor's prescription, you can get a prescription for your medication for free.
If your doctor gives you a prescription, it will take your medications for a period of time.
I am a long-time patient of the drug industry. I am used to being able to get discounts on my medications. I used to

Expected Response: this is a common question i receive from patients. you've probably seen many commercials on tv offering assistance to patients who cannot afford their medications. many pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs which can include free or discounted medications. i recommend you work with your health care provider to identify the right medication for your condition and then contact the pharmaceutical company who manufactures that medication to see if you qualify for the prescription assistance program. contact the partnership for prescription assistance at www. pparx. org or by calling 888-477-2669.

Question: can i take meloxicam tylenol and aleve at the same time?
Baseline Response: no.

Expected Response: meloxicam is a prescription strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) while acetaminophen (tylenol) is an effective analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). aleve is an over-the-counter nsaid. i would not take aleve while taking meloxicam due to the increased risk of side effects and toxicity issues. if you need to take a pain reliever in addition to the meloxicam i would stick with the acetaminophen. if this doesn’t alleviate the migraine/headaches then i would consult your health care professional about the cause of the migraines and what can be used to treat the symptoms. meloxican & tylenol : meloxican(mobic) is a nsaid it's an antiinflamatory that decreases swelling. tylenol is an analgesic and used for acute pain. so they go hand in hand especially if you just injured something like a knee ankle something like that. take mobic at same time each day to even the blood and it's better to take with food. tylenol can be used as needed for pain. you can take meloxicam and tylenol together but i would not recommend that you take meloxicam and aleve together. refer here <link> can i take tylenol with meloxicam?

Question: i'm going to the dentist for a root canal and i've had a few glasses of wine. will this be a problem with the novocaine?
Baseline Response: yes, but i'll wait for the dentist to say if i can take it.

Expected Response: it is never a good idea to drink alcohol right before a dental appointment. alcohol affects your blood clotting system and depresses the central nervous system. not to mention how it can affect your in-office behavior. if you have anxiety it is much better to tell the dentist beforehand and so you can discuss your options.

I have never seen a person overdose with a substance that is similar to alterra, but which is less toxic. 5. I don. 6. I do not know. 7. I believe that an overdose is caused by a chemical imbalance.

Expected Response: if overdose is suspected contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.

Question: what is heartburn?
Baseline Response: heartburn is a symptom of a heart condition. If you have a heartburn, it is caused by a buildup of calcium in your blood. The buildup of this calcium builds up over time and can cause your heart to swell and swell. If the buildup of the calcium in the blood is too high, it can cause a heart attack or stroke. If your heart is a little too heavy, it may be because you have some form of heart failure.
If you have heartburn and you have problems breathing, you may have a high blood pressure. If this is the case, you can have a very high blood sugar and you may experience a stroke or heart attack.
You may also experience heart failure or heart disease. Heart failure is when your body stops functioning, or stops functioning. Heart disease is when you are unable to function properly or to take steps to avoid causing heart failure, or heart failure when you have other symptoms.

Baseline Response: i have no problems with this condition, but i am afraid it could be a problem with my testicle. I am not sure if it is a problem for me or not. I have a normal sized testicle, but my anus has a small problem. what should i do about it?
Answer
Answer - it is not my problem. I think it is my problem with the pain I have had from the

Expected Response: if you want an exact answer then you will need to be examined by a medical professional. based on the information you have shared there is a very good chance that you do have a perirectal abscess or a pilonidal abscess. either of these two painful conditions require immediate medical attention. do not delay.

Question: when i swallow i sometimes get crackling in my ear. is this an ear infection or just wax please
Baseline Response: it depends on the ear. It's a very good thing to have a good ear, especially if you have a really bad ear. If you have wax that makes it hard to hear, it can be irritating.
How to avoid ear infection:
The first step is to clean your ears. You can also go to the doctor.
What if I have a bad ear?
If you have an infection of the ear canal that is causing pain or irritation, you can get an infection from your ear canal.
If it's the first time you hear something like a buzzing sound, you'll have a hard time hearing it.
You can get a bad infection from the ear using a vibrator, a soft toothbrush or a piece of paper.
The pain of having a bad sound will be more severe.
Do you have to clean the ear

Expected Response: ear infections (middle ear infections) typically cause pain and often fever. if you are not experiencing these symptoms it is not very likely you have an ear infection. crackling sounds in the ear can be caused by many things; when the eustachian tubes (a tiny ventilation tube that runs from your middle ear - the area on the other side of your eardrum) equalizes pressure you may hear a pop or crackling sound. fluid (effusion) in the middle ear can cause crackling. yes even a wax impaction lying against the eardrum or a stray hair can do this. less commonly other middle ear and inner ear disorders can cause this sensation. the only way you can begin to pinpoint the cause is to see your medical provider or an ent for a hands-on examination. treatment would depend on on your diagnosis. i have the same thing crackling sound in ears i think it to do with my jaw but how? same herre?

Question: can hugging kissing or making out with a guy with clothes on lead to pregnancy?
Baseline Response: it's not as simple as that.
Source: http://www.bibdsl.co.uk/w10-images/l/MM00241402.jpg
The Independent: "The British Medical Association is calling for a ban on kissing in public, saying it could lead to a 'pregnancy-induced' miscarriage".
The Times: "Doctors have warned that kissing is 'likely to lead to miscarriage' and could lead people to become pregnant."
The Mail: "It is thought that kissing can lead to miscarriages."
BBC News: "In a poll of over 2,000 women, 15 per cent said kissing should not be done during pregnancy, while 10 per cent of men said kissing could lead them to a miscarriage."
This is a very small number but the statistics are encouraging.

Question: what is cryothalamotomy for parkinson's disease?
Baseline Response: a condition that is most common in humans. It is a disease that causes a small amount of abnormal blood cells to form in the middle of the brain and may cause a person to lose consciousness. Cryostasis is a condition where a person loses consciousness when a protein in the brain causes the cells to die and the brain is unable to process them properly. Cryoarthritis is a rare condition that can cause seizures. In people who have this condition, they are unable to move their hands, or to take a shower, or even breathe properly.
What is cryostasis?
Cerethrosis is a common condition that occurs when the body's cells become too thin or too weak, or when the cells become damaged or damaged in the process of recycling nutrients, or in the body.
Creaming can occur when a person's cells are too small or too strong, or that their body is

Expected Response: a cryothalamotomy is a surgical procedure where a "super-cooled" probe is inserted deep into the part of the brain called the thalamus in an effort to stop the tremors of parkinson's. this type of surgery is rarely recommended and has been replaced by deep brain stimulation (dbs).

Question: why would a doctor prescribe atenolol to treat mild hypothyroidism? . just trying to gain a better understanding of this.
Baseline Response: I am not sure why I feel this way. I was told that it was a good thing that I had a thyroid problem. I guess that's what I was hoping for.
Source: Wikipedia
Source of the question: Why would a physician prescribe athenolol?
Source-of-the-question: I'm not sure if you're able to answer the question.
As mentioned, I've read that there are multiple reasons for the fact that there is no known treatment for this condition.
I am not a doctor, so I do not have any specific medical or medical advice.
So, if you are a patient, do not prescribe atepithelial, and don't get yourself prescribed atenotransferase (ATEP), unless you are doing something that is not very helpful to your

Expected Response: i don't understand it either. this is a beta blocker primarily used to lower blood pressure. you would need to ask your doctor for his/her rationale.

Question: why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?
Baseline Response: because the patient is breathing.
What's the best way to ensure the patient stays healthy?
How long does it take to lose fluid? What's the recommended time for a patient to lose a fluid? How long does the patient stay in a hospital bed?
What can be done to help prevent this from happening?
These questions are the ones that really matter.
They help me understand why I have to stay in hospital every day.
When I was a child, I'd have to sit in the chair of my bed every day and watch the doctor's appointments.
I'd have my own doctor, who'd be in charge of my day to day life.
And then I'd sit in my chair and watch a doctor's appointment.
How often does a person have to go to the ER?
I'm sure many people in our community have to do that every day for their health.

Question: i was on atenolol 50 bid for hypertension insurance changed to 100 once a day. should i take this in the a. m. or p. m.? . hello i have been on 50 mg bid of atenolol for years for hypertension but my insurance recently changed it to 100 mg once a day. when is the best time to take this morning or evening? thank you.
Baseline Response: atenole is a drug that is available in the United States and in Europe. Atenol is used to treat hypertension and is the most effective medication for hypertension in the world. At Enolol is 100 mg daily and atenosin is 100-200 mg daily. There are no known side effects from the use of Atenosins.

Expected Response: i think you should call your health care provider's office about this. your insurance company cannot change your prescription dosing. only a licensed medical professional can do that. please call your doctor or pharmacist right away to clarify the instructions for taking this medication. if the atenolol is provided as a tablet it's possible you may be able to split the tablet and continue to take one 50-mg dose twice a day. but i do not want you to do that without guidance from your pharmacist or health care provider. hope this helps!

Question: the jason company advertises microsilk as a cure for eczema. does this have any credibility? . see <link>
Baseline Response: this is not an ethical question.
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it is a legitimate question, and I'm not alone. I am sure a lot of people have been asking this question, but it seems to be a very common question. I think it's important to have some sort of information about how the jasons work. How do they do this? I don't know if this is a good or bad question. Maybe they do it because they are interested in helping people with eczemology, or maybe they do because they want to help others, but I don´t know.
So I have no idea what the answer is.

Baseline Response: i am not a doctor and i have not made any comments on my condition in any way. i will update this thread on the next few days.
Answer 2: please don't call me a doctor. it's just a doctor that is taking care of me. i hope you will understand and agree with my comments.
The more you read about this issue, the more I understand why it is so important that you keep your questions to

Expected Response: i think you're wise to get a second opinion. whether or not the x-rays look "fine " the truth is you're symptomatic. you deserve to learn why you're having problems. the main reason i wanted to respond though is to suggest you take your temperature. if you have a fever i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for some blood work. a fever can be a sign of infection and infection of a prosthetic knee is always a possibility. if you do have an infection you'd want to get that treated as soon as possible. while you're waiting for your appointment with the second doctor i'd suggest you use an assistive device to help stabilize your balance so you don't fall. either a 4-point cane or a walker would be ideal. the last thing you want is to sustain an injury before you get your knee problem figured out. wishing you all the best and hoping you feel better soon!

Question: are these symptoms of pregnancy? . 3 weeks ago i had some vaginal spotting i only noticed it when i went to the toilet. now my period is 2 weeks late. i have done 2hpt both negative. ive also had very watery discharge and some mild cramps but not like menstrual cramps. i have also been very tired aswell sleeping 8 hours at night and then a few hours in the afternoon. i have felt quite sick & feel quite sensitive to some smells. does this sound like i could be pregnant and the pregnancy tests did not detect the hcg hormone?
Baseline Response: yes, your hcgi is a hormone that has been in the blood for millions of years. hcgs are the hormones that control the body's metabolism and also control how the body functions. hbg is the hormone that controls blood sugar and energy levels. hfg is an hormone that regulates the brain's production of dopamine. hg is also the hormone responsible

Expected Response: home pregnancy tests are very accurate. if you're 2 weeks late and have had 2 negative tests it's unlikely that you're pregnant. many of the symptoms you mention would be quite unusual so early in pregnancy or are not typically associated with pregnancy at all so i would not assume that's what's going on. you should see your doctor to see what is going on as it doesn't sound like pregnancy is the most likely thing at this point.

Question: what kind of snacks would you recommend for people who are diabetic?
Baseline Response: all of these things are in the table. If you're diabetic, you should be able to eat a variety of snacks. A good snack is peanut butter, peanut butter muffins, and cookies.
What about people who have diabetes?
The most common type of diabetes in the US is type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
A quick search on the web reveals that Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and there are many factors that contribute to the risk of having type 1.
The first is that your body is constantly trying to keep insulin in your blood to maintain normal blood sugar levels. If your body doesn't keep insulin, you'll have type 1 type 2 type 3 type 4 type 5 type 6 type 7 type 8 type 9 type 10 type 11 type 12 type 13 type 14 type 15 type 16 type 17 type 18 type

Expected Response: a diet to help control diabetes is often individually prescribed -- based on body weight and lifestyle -- to help keep blood sugar levels in control. the best snacks for diabetics will contain some protein and some fiber to help slow down food absorption and therefore help control blood sugar levels and prevent spiking. avoid simple sugars such as in cookies and candies and choose whole grain crackers low-fat cheeses maybe a slice of turkey or leftover chicken. and pair these foods with a small amount of fruit if desired. know that fruit while healthy can be high in natural sugars that will spike blood sugar levels unless combined with a protein source to slow down their absorption in your body.

If you're having an issue, go to the doctor. If they don't have any help, call the hospital.
What do you do to help?
I take a lot to help, I don't get too much help.
Do you get shot for mono or do you recive it?
No I recive for mono.
How do you know if your doctor is right for you?
The doctor will tell you if you're doing it right.

Expected Response: no pneumonia is usually treated without the indignity and pain of an (antibiotic? ) injection. there are many types and severity of pneumonia but if they medical provider assumed that he had a bacterial type these can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. sometimes with younger children who may be vomiting (not good candidates for oral medications) or those with severe pneumonia i will give an antibiotic injection. they are not happy about it but getting them better is the most important goal. there is a shot to prevent many types of pneumonia (pneumococcal)? i had one this morning!

Question: small bump in groin area? lymph node fatty deposit cyst? please look. hi i have had a bump in my groin area just above where the upper thigh meets the groin for about 4 months. this bump is hard and about the size of a bb and has no color change cannot be seen only felt it is not painful at all and has not changed in size. one thing that may be helpful to know is that i can actually completely pinch this little bump in my skin fold and when i do that i can feel nothing behind it. any help would be greatly appreciated! thanks <positive_smiley>

Thanks for the great

Expected Response: you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this lump properly examined. a description is never sufficient information when making an accurate diagnosis. as much as i would like to help you it would not be in your best interest to make blind guesses over the internet. i understand totally and thanks for responding. i am aware it could be many different things. i should have been a little more clear on what i wanted to know and that is can a lymph node be totally pinched off in the skin fold? i always thought that they were a little deeper below the skin. as i mentioned i can completely pinch this bump in the skin and can feel nothing directly beneath it when i do. not looking for an actual diagnosis that i know is not possible over the internet just want to know if its possible to completely pinch a lymph node in the skin as mentioned. thanks very much! thanks for responding. wouldn't a hair follicle or blind spot have a little redness or pain to it though? this little bump is very hard small and completely painless and un noticeable to the eye. i have only noticed it the last 4 months but have no idea on how long it has actually been there for. kind of found it by accident really. thanks again! hi after reading your post and reply it could just be a blind spot or the site of a hair follicle that's growing inwards it happens hope this helps you. good luck

Baseline Response: the answer is yes. there are no med side effects. the med side is the main problem. there is no way to correct the problem. but there are ways to fix it. if you are going to use a med, make sure you have a med that is safe for you to use. meds are not safe for patients with hypertension or for people with diabetes. the only way to do that

Expected Response: yes definitely. you should take second opinion and start with the anti-hypertensive medications. we advice to start with plain arjuna powder (terminalia arjuna) at dose of 3 gms daily after meals with lukewarm water.

Baseline Response: no. the only way to ensure that your treatment is effective is to have a complete evaluation and treatment plan before taking any medication. If you have an autoimmune condition, you might want to talk with your doctor about the risks of taking these medications. If your doctor is not able to do that, you may want to contact your doctor first. If he or she can't do that (or your doctor doesn't want to do it) you may be able to get a prescription from your doctor.
I have a very young daughter and a very large family. My daughter is 6 and my oldest daughter is 3. I am very excited to be able help her with her treatment. Please help her if you can!
If you have any questions about your treatment or if you would like to get more information about sorafene tablets, please contact me at:

Expected Response: i'm very sorry to hear about your dad. this must be a difficult time for you and your family. hepatocellular carcinoma as you probably know is liver cancer. sorafenib is a medication (chemotherapy drug) designed to slow the spread of cancer cells. it probably will not cure the cancer but it may help slow down the disease. if your dad or your family has questions about any of the medications the doctor is prescribing you should feel free to make an appointment to discuss the issue. some questions you might want to ask are: what does this medication do? what is the goal of this drug therapy? how should this drug be taken? what are possible side effects of this medication? are there other medications that could be used? if so why are you choosing this particular drug? what happens if the drug does not work as expected? what would the "next step" be? sorafenib has produced good results during clinical trials in terms of extending survival rates of people with liver cancer. i am hoping your dad is among the many who benefit from this treatment. i wish you and your family all the best!

Question: what's the best way to shave my face?
Baseline Response: this is really hard, and I do feel a bit of a bit like a little girl, but it is my job to shave it, so it is not like I need to make myself look like a big, bad boy.
This is the way I shave my teeth.
I can't do this, so I've always done it.
It is, however, a very simple, but important, process that I've been doing for years.
The first step is to use a toothbrush.
You can also do this with your teeth, but this is not really necessary.
If you are using a tooth brush, you need to use the right tool.
Then, you use a razor and apply a small amount of the right amount of shaving cream.
After you have applied the cream, you shave the teeth with your razor.
When you have finished shaving, you can use a lot

Expected Response: most men shave their face on a daily basis; here are a few tips for a more comfortable shave. the best time to shave is after you shower. the warm water allows the pores to open and also softens facial hair before shaving. always apply a shaving cream or shave gel to prepare your skin before shaving. using a shave brush (natural bristles are best) instead of your hands is the best way to apply your shaving cream. a shaving brush will help your whiskers to stand up and will result in a closer shave; using your hands will actually push the hair down. as you shave go with the grain not against it. this will help to prevent hair bumps from forming. the top layer of skin is exfoliated as you shave; therefore it is important to moisturize your skin after you shave. this will replace any moisture that was taken away during shaving. it is best to use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful uv rays.

Question: i recieved a teanus shot in my left shoulder 30 days ago and it still makes my whole arm numb. did they hit a nerve?
Baseline Response: They probably hit a bit of a nerve, but they're not as bad as the other shots. The only thing that makes me think they're doing more damage than they are is that it's the same shot.
Answer 2: I'm having a lot of trouble with my hand.

Expected Response: if the injection was given improperly it is very possible to involve nerves in this area. since it has been a month you should be examined by your medical provider or the place where you received the injection.
================================================================================
Question: my urologist put me on doxazosin for urinary incontinence. why did she ask my doctor to take the hct out of my benicar?
Baseline Response: she has a urinary incisor and it is not a cause for concern, it is a symptom of something else, so she will not take it out. I was told that I would have a urinary infection if I didn't take it.
The doctor will tell you that if you take the doxoazosinic medication, it will be less of a problem.
Doxazosa, as they say, is a medication that works by reducing the amount of fluid in the urine, and it's a good medicine.
Dr. T, a doctor at St. Mary's Hospital, who has a very good knowledge of the use of doxosin, told me that the reason for the urinary incision was because she had a urinary tract infection. She had had

Expected Response: she most likely suggested stopping the hct part of the benicar since the hct refers to hydrochlorothiazide a diuretic that helps lower blood pressure by acting as a water pill. the effects of a water pill can bring on or worsen urinary incontinence since it makes you have to urinate more often.
================================================================================
Question: what are some stretching exercises?
Baseline Response: stretching exercises are exercises that can be done without any physical exercise. They are really good for both the beginner and the advanced beginner.
The beginner needs to know what is needed and how to use them. The advanced beginner should also know what exercises are necessary to do them properly.
There are many stretching exercises out there. There are a few of them that are just as good for beginners as for advanced players.

Question: can sulfameth/trimethoprim treat chlamydia. what dosage should be taken?
Baseline Response: The most effective method for treating chlamydialysis is with sulfamethyl sulfate. It is recommended that a person who is taking sulfamene chloride is given a dose of 250 milligrams per day. If the person is not taking sulfamate chloride, the person should not take sulfamate chloride. In a randomized controlled trial, a sulfamide-free diet was used to treat cholangiocarcinoma in patients with cholangellia. It was found that sulfamides were able to be administered to treat the disease. It should be noted that sulfamate is also a well-known laxative.

Question: i am trying to stay away from glucose. i need a food plan that doesn't have glucose.
Baseline Response: i can get one, i don't need the other.
If you have diabetes, you can get a food that doesn' use glucose. You can get an insulin pill that doesn´t use glucose, but it´s not glucose. It´s a glucose pill. If you're diabetic, you may get insulin pills. If it´'s not diabetes, then you're going to have insulin pills and you´ll get diabetes.
For a person who is in the middle of a pregnancy, you should get an insurance plan that does not have glucose, and you should not get insulin.
for people with diabetes, if you have a preexisting condition, then if you can't get an insufficiency insurance plan, then the insurance company will not pay you.
if you can, but if you are not covered, then it´ll be

Expected Response: it is uncommon to follow a low glucose diet as it is found in many carbohydrate foods and a true allergy is rare. table sugar or sucrose is made up of two simple sugars fructose and glucose. fruits and vegetables also contain both fructose and glucose. lactose the sugar in milk is made up of the simple sugars glucose and galactose. glucose is also part of corn syrup high fructose corn syrup honey and other syrups. you may have been advised to follow a low sugar diet or low glycemic diet. that would mean choosing whole foods without added sugars such as fruits vegetables whole grains lean meats unsweetened dairy products. check labels for words that are code for sugar such as maltose dextrose brown rice syrup high fructose corn syrup malt syrup molasses cane sugar corn sweetener raw sugar fruit juice concentrate syrup honey and evaporated cane juice. for more on hidden foods with added sugars see this article <link> this article reviews a low glycemic diet <link> always check with a healthcare provider when following a restricted diet.

Question: is it safe for the baby to be born at 22 weeks? . my friend is in the hospital on bed rest she is 22 weeks pregnant and the baby wants to come out. will the baby survive if he comes out now?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer #2:
If the baby is born at 20 weeks, will the child be born to any other baby?
I am not sure if the baby will be born with a baby with a parent or a parent who is a parent.
I would ask you to find a baby who is your child. I have heard that there are more babies than there are parents who have children with their own parents.
If there is a baby of a certain age, how many do you think will be the age of the child?
The oldest baby of your choice will be your child, but if there are other babies of the same age, then the oldest baby will also be the child of the other child.

Question: can mixing vodka and crystal light drink mix be dangerous?
Baseline Response: I think it is. I think people should be aware that a bottle of vodka with crystal light is much more dangerous. I have never seen a bottle with crystal and I don't think people know how to make it. But I do think that you need to be aware of what you are mixing and what you need.
It is not like you are going to be able to mix a bottle or a bottle that contains the same amount of alcohol. It is just a matter of getting your hands on the bottle.
I know there are some people who think that if you drink a lot of vodka then you should be very careful about it. I don. I would rather not be in a situation where I am drinking more than I should be. I am not saying that you should not drink lots of vodka. You should drink lots. But if you are drinking vodka then don't drink too much. You need to

Expected Response: drinking vodka can be dangerous. drinking crystal light is not. if you mix the two together as a mixed drink the vodka is still dangerous.
================================================================================
Question: how can i manage my stress when i have cancer?
Baseline Response: You can try to figure out what type of cancer you are. For example, if you are a woman, your breast cancer will be diagnosed as a woman's breast cancer. You can also try to get an ultrasound or blood test to see if you have cancer. If you are not sure about your cancer, try to find a doctor that will help you.
If you have any questions about your doctor, you can ask him or her online.
How to find your doctor
The following are some common questions to ask your doctor about your breast cancers.
1. What is your treatment plan?
2. Do you have a prescription?
3. Do I have a free mammogram?
4. Do my appointments have to be made online?
5. What does my doctor recommend for me?
6. Do your appointments have a doctor's note?
7. Do the appointments have any

Expected Response: managing stress can play an important role in combating cancer-related fatigue. here are some suggestions that may help. adjust your expectations. for example if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. a sense of accomplishment goes a long way to reducing stress. help others understand and support you. family and friends can be helpful if they can "put themselves in your shoes" and understand what fatigue means to you. cancer groups can be a source of support as well. other people with cancer understand what you are going through. relaxation techniques such as audiotapes that teach deep breathing or visualization can help reduce stress. activities that divert your attention away from fatigue can also be helpful. for example activities such as knitting reading or listening to music require little physical energy but require attention. if your stress seems out of control talk to a health care professional.

Question: i've a spot in the vision of my r eye for a few of days its like i've been looking at bright lite but isn't going a way. i do not have any head pains or eye pains no ichyness not filling light headed or dizzy. vision a little blurry in right eye only where the spot is. a few days before i noticed this spot i was hit in the left eye hard enough to cut cheeck and black eye would this have anything to do with this.
Baseline Response: yes. i've seen this in the past and i'm glad i'm seeing it again. i'm not sure what it's about but it does look like a patchy patch that's not really there. i have no idea what it is but i'm looking at it with my right eye and i think it's a bit of a dark spot.

Expected Response: interestingly yes the two things could be related. and you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can. under certain circumstances it's possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye. this is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse. usually though this sort of situation occurs when there's a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself. thus the symptoms you're experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye. while this isn't an emergency i'd recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out what's going on. no sense taking chances with your vision! best to you!
================================================================================
Question: after working out i sometimes get a pain in my backside. it seems similar to sciatica. how can i ease this pain?
Baseline Response: this is probably the most common pain in the backside of your back. It is most often caused by pain in your back that goes to your back, and not your back side.
How can i fix it?
If you are not able to use your backside in a good way, or have a back pain, you will need to get a prescription.
If your back pain is just too much, you can try something else.
What if I have my back pain and it's not bothering me?
It's pretty common in people with back pain. If you have a lot of pain in that area, you might not be able to work out.
Do you know if it's your back or not?
There are many medications that can help you get better.
I have a problem with my

Expected Response: it is important to differentiate between sore muscles from the workout and a possible injury. you typically feel sore muscles about a day later and the feeling can last for 2 to 3 days. you can treat it with rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin ibuprofen or naproxen. if there is pain associated with the sciatica you should consult your physician to make sure there isn't a more intense injury that needs to be treated.

Question: my 59 yr old husband has burning in his hands & feet ache & numbness off & on during the day & at bedtime. his job requires driving alot & he has to take his shoes off to get relief from symptoms mentioned above. he takes synthroid twynsta crestor & ambien.
Baseline Response: I have never been ill during the week.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear your husband is going through this. he sounds like a hardworking man. he needs to have these symptoms evaluated by a medical professional. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. they could be related to his truck driving (nerve irritation in the back) but they could also signal an underlying condition that needs to be treated. i wish i could offer you a good explanation but these types of symptoms truly must be evaluated by physical examination and tests. i wish you and your husband all the best!
================================================================================
Question: my daughter takes citalopram hydrobromide tab 20 mg and seroquel tab 100 mg. which is for indicated for sleeplessness?
Baseline Response: this is a common misconception. Citaloprimide is a medication that is used to treat anxiety, insomnia and other sleep disorders. It is used as a treatment for a number of medications, including the benzodiazepine, naproxen, citalostimol, naltrexone, and sedatives. Cialis is a medicine that is often used as an adjunct to benzodepam. Cicalis is not used in the US for the treatment of insomnia.
Answer 1: there is no evidence to support this claim.
2: there are many studies that show that cialis may help with insomnia, insomnia, and other issues that may cause insomnia. These include:
a) the use of benzodromic antidepressants, which are not recommended for insomnia
b)

Expected Response: both medications are depression medications and have side effects for drowsiness. seroquel tends to cause more drowsiness but both have the side effect. when used adjunctively the side effect tendency increases. neither of these medications will be prescribed for sleep aid alone. you should consult your daughter’s doctor for a better understanding as to why these medications were prescribed and use your pharmacist for a better understanding of how these medications work in the body.

Question: warts on hands tried home remedies o/c med derm. burned off removed by surgeon and imiquimod. back and spreading mor. this is my 19 yr old son and we have been fighting these for 3+ years now. they are spreading rapidly and we have no clue where else to turn. we have tried all the home remedies we can find including duct tape super glue apple cider vinegar and on and on. the surgeon had to put 5 stitches on the palm of his hand when he removed one and it's back and larger. is there an oral medicine he could possibly try? he now has about 18 on one hand
Baseline Response: I'm very confused. I think he's trying to treat his left hand (in the palm). This is not a very good thing. I have no idea what the procedure is. I know he has been in pain for a long time and has been taking medication. It's a very serious medical condition. He's not a doctor

Expected Response: there are no oral medicines that are routinely used to treat common warts although some people have tried the cimetidine (tagomet) but this is certainly an off-label use with mixed results. personally i have never used it. my suggestion would be for him to see a good dermatologist. someone who can work with him closely trying different high-end treatments until a cure is orchestrated. he has definitely tried lots of things but i have never met a wart that i couldn't (eventually) kill with persistent treatments. i use liquid nitrogen most of the time but there are more topical (prescription) treatments that can be used if the dermatologist feels it is appropriate.

Question: i accidentally had very hot water on my penis will there be a nerve damage or friction burn? . the areas include penis head and the one right under it. the water hit only small areas but it was so hot. the accident happened just an hour ago.
Baseline Response: i tried to use an electric current but the water was so HOT that it would melt my penis.

Expected Response: hi hope you got straight under cold water after try icing it this should help relieve the pain if you still have any. if you have some or can get some try burn cream. good luck
================================================================================
Question: i have a fever. can i take tylenol if i'm taking buspar and ritalin?
Baseline Response: i would take the buspar if i had to.
Answer 1: i'd be better off taking the bus par and riclopin if i didn't have any other medication.

Expected Response: yes. it is safe to use tylenol with buspar and ritalin. there are no significant interactions between the medications.

Question: hi is gallbladder cancer a common disease? also is it possible to have it detected early enough to be cured? . my mother had a few episodes of vomiting over the last few weeks and also lost about 30 pounds during the last two years without really trying to do so. she had bloodwork done last week and had an ultrasound performed this tuesday. she received a call from her primary care physician yesterday (wednesday) asking her to come in so her doctor can review the results with her. i'm obviously nervous since the results were provided to her physician so quickly. is this normal turn around time?
Baseline Response: I'm sure that this is normal. But, it's not a complete cure for gallblar disease. It's just a symptom.
Answer 3: In the US, if you have gallblarth, you are in the US at about the same time as you are at any other time. If you have other gallblur cancers in your body

Expected Response: based on the description i am not sure why you are assuming gallbladder cancer since it is quite rare. maybe the doctor indicated that was a concern. ultrasound results are available quickly so i wouldn't let that part worry you. however unintentional weight loss is a concern and i'm glad that her doctor is getting to the bottom of what's going on. to answer your specific question gallbladder cancer is not common and fewer than 10 000 people are diagnosed with it every year (including cancers of the gallbladder bile ducts). it is usually found fairly late because it's often advanced by the time someone has significant syptoms. if it's found early which happens in about 1 in 5 people there is the possibility to cure it. but even if it can't be cured treatment can definitely help prolong life.
================================================================================
Question: is wearing a bra to bed every day bad for your breasts?
Baseline Response: yes. Yes, I know that, and I will tell you why.
I can't say that I dislike it. I don't feel like I'm doing it for the right reasons.
But I have to admit that I'm not so much against bra-wearing as I am against it.
And this is where I think there is a lot of truth in the idea that it's bad for breasts.

================================================================================
Question: what can i do about head lice?
Baseline Response: I would love to hear from you about this, but I have a few things to say about it. First off, I think you should have your head cleaned up before you head into bed. I'm sure you're tired of hearing about how you're supposed to be a good dad to your kids. I know you are. And I know that you're very concerned about what your children are going to do with your head. But, if you're worried about your kids, you can always use your own discretion and make the best decision for them. I mean, it's a good idea, but sometimes we all have a little bit of trouble sleeping. So, I've never really had to worry about it, and I've been able to get myself to sleep at least three or four times a night.
So, I would also like to hear about your other personal concerns. What is your favorite time to wake up

Expected Response: head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system. just the mention of head lice will make you scratch (i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now). head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood. yes head lice are vampires — they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases. lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department. lice lay dozens of eggs (nits); eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species. as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now! now you can scratch your head. it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy. school systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. schools must have a team of nit nazis. insects are taking over our world. actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world. dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. termites are eating our homes. flies are landing on our dinner plate. ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. kids — even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes — can get head lice. i know. my long-haired daughter brought some home many years ago. girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. i often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well. i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. “your daughter has head lice. ” “what! are you sure? could it be something else? ” “no. she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp-crickets also known as the common cootie. you probably have them too. ” like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like nix) malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested stromectal — a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive. there is a lice-smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta people don’t know you are killing innocent lice. my late grandmother mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist used kerosene. once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring the next job is to manually remove the nits. there are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft but in the end adults end up just picking them out one at a time. there may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. lice do not respect social status so anyone can get them. if your kids bring them home from school then you will need to go to def con 4. the recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. vacuum the carpets and mattresses but again lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. it is not necessary to burn down the house and move.

Question: why do i yawn after 30-40 minutes of exercising?
Baseline Response: you are doing it too fast because you are not going to get used to it.


I can explain why. I've been doing it for over 30 minutes now and I feel like I'm finally getting used to the way I'm doing it. I feel better, my body is doing it right, and I'm enjoying the feeling of relaxation. I don't have any major issues with my body, so I'm just going to keep going. I'm not really feeling any problems at all. I just want to enjoy my workout.

Expected Response: it doesn’t seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because you’re fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isn’t one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance. iron deficiency

Question: plz answer correctly. i don't think you understood the question. i was drinking orange juice it seemed to go the wrong way and i hacked a little but did not cough. one hour after drinking i felt a little tickly so i coughed once intentionally. any danger?
Baseline Response: yes, it is a very small risk. the risk is small, but it is still very small. i think this is a risk that you should take.
I'm not sure what it is, but I don't know what it means.
Do you have any other advice to the people who are in the middle of their own troubles, and who are struggling with their own problems?
I know that many of you have had the same problem and it is getting worse.
One of the reasons it is happening is that your car is starting to break down, and you are driving down the street.
You have a bad car.
But, the problem is that you

Expected Response: most helpful answer had you aspirated a sufficient amount of orange juice or any liquid for that matter into your lungs i can assure you that you would have immediately coughed and coughed extensively as your body clears your airway. you have two lungs -- three separate lobes on the right and two lobes on the left so even if you did accidentally aspirate a tiny amount it would be harmless. and would not result in a situation that one would call drowning.

Question: should i be worried if my baby weighs more than usual for his getstational age? . should i be worried if my baby weighs more than usual for his getstational age? . i am 17 and a half weeks pregnant and had my level 2 ultrasound done. i was told my son weighs 9 oz. is that big for his gestational age?
Baseline Response: yes, but i was not told.
Answer to question: should my baby weigh more than normal for his? .
Answer To question: is my baby weighing more than or equal to normal for my getstative age? , i am 15 and a month pregnant and has my level 1 ultrasound done . i was instructed my son weighed 9 oz and my level 3 ultrasound done at 11:15 a.m. is my level 4 ultrasound done?
The answer to this question depends on your level of childbearing. If your child is 5-8 months old, you may have to ask your child if

Expected Response: ultrasounds help health professionals estimate weight but it is impossible to be precise with weight until the baby is born. your healthcare provider will measure baby's growth in a variety of ways to make sure everything is on track and should alert you if it is not. for example they will measure the size of the head and the length of the bones on ultrasounds monitor your weight and size. it is best to address growth concerns with your doctor who is following your case closely. see this article for more details of growth during the second trimester of pregnancy. congrats on your pregnancy!

Question: what is acute fulminant hepatitis?
Baseline Response: acute fulvant hepatitis is the most common form of acute hepatitis.
Hepatitis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe and chronic inflammation of the liver, kidneys, and other organs. It is also often referred to as a "disease of the kidneys".
What is acute?
HEPATI is a disease of the kidney, and can cause kidney failure, kidney stones, and kidney failure. It has been shown to affect a wide range of organ systems, including the liver and kidneys. It can also affect some other organs, including heart, lungs, and pancreas.
What causes acute? Hepatitis can cause serious side effects.
How long does acute hepatitis last?
It usually lasts for three to six months, and lasts for several years.
Who is at risk?
People who have acute hepatitis are those who are at high risk of getting hepatitis C. Those who

Expected Response: rarely individuals with acute infections with hepatitis a and hepatitis b develop severe inflammation and the liver fails (acute fulminant hepatitis). these patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis and the additional problems of confusion or coma (due to the liver's failure to detoxify chemicals) and bruising or bleeding (due to a lack of blood clotting factors). in fact up to 80% of people with acute fulminant hepatitis can die within days to weeks; therefore it is fortunate that acute fulminant hepatitis is rare. for example less than 0. 5% of adults with acute infection with hepatitis b will develop acute fulminant hepatitis.

Question: what causes leg cramps?
Baseline Response: It's a combination of the following:
1. Leg cramps occur when the right side of the leg is bent.
2. The right side bends.
3. The left side bends and the right hand cramps.
4. The leg cramp is a sign of a condition called "stupor syndrome."
5. Leg pain is caused by a nerve or muscle problem.
6. Leg numbness is caused when the body is unable to maintain balance.
7. Leg weakness is caused because the muscles in the legs are not properly contracted.
8. Leg stiffness is caused from a lack of proper balance.

Expected Response: leg cramps are mostly caused by dehydration low magnesium or low blood calcium. the best treatment for cramps is to rehydrate and replenish your electrolytes possibly with chicken or beef broth. use pain patch
================================================================================
Question: me and my daughter just might have ate bad meat what could happen
Baseline Response: There are many factors at play when it comes to eating bad meat. One of these is that the animal is genetically engineered to be a "good" animal. The other is that there are genetically engineered animals that are good.
A good animal is one that is able to produce more calories than a bad animal, and can produce more protein than a good animal.
An animal that is genetically "good", such as an egg, can produce up to 7,000 calories per day. A bad animal can produce less than 2,000.
I'm sure the food industry has been very happy with the results of the FDA's review, but there's still a lot of work to do.
For example, the FDA is looking at whether there is any way to prevent the production of a toxin that can cause anemia. It's been suggested that there could be some form of vaccine, but

Expected Response: well you will know soon enough if the meat you ate was spoiled or otherwise "bad. " usually food poisoning starts with diarrhea but may also include nausea vomiting and abdominal cramps. the onset of symptoms depends on which bacterium is causing the food poisoning. there are more than a dozen organisms that can cause food poisoning. e. coli is a common cause of food poisoning from meat. symptoms from e. coli usually begin 3 to 4 days after exposure to the organism. many cases of food poisoning go away on their own. it's important not to take any anti-diarrhea medications if you begin having food poisoning-related diarrhea as this is the body's way of getting rid of the toxin. however diarrhea can be very dehydrating so it's important to drink plenty of water during this time. if your daughter is very young and begins to exhibit the signs of food poisoning such as diarrhea that is accompanied by severe abdominal pain or doesn't stop after 24 hours i'd suggest you seek immediate medical treatment. the same is true if either of you experiences numbness or tingling of the hands face or feet or if you experience confusion. i hope the meat was fine and neither of you suffers any ill effect! you will soon know

Question: im 14 i could produce sperm but now it woun't come out im scarred could it get answered quickly please im 14 yrs old btw. what happening
Baseline Response: im 13 i can't help but be so scared i cant believe it. i have to say, i'm really worried. i feel like the future is a nightmare. im 13 my best friend is already dead. im 12 can you find me a babysitter
Answer : im 11 i'm so scared im 13 but i dont know what to do
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: without the ability to examine you and take an extensive medical history it would be impossible for me or any medical provider to blindly offer you a patient-specific explanation. my immediate advice to you is to lay off masturbation for about 3-4 days and then see what happens. frequent ejaculations can decrease seminal volume significantly so give it rest for a few days. i suspect things will return to normal.

Question: do i have to take antibiotics for gastroenteritis or is it possible for us to get better without antibiotics?
Baseline Response: i dont have to be antibiotic free to get proper health. i would like to know what your personal health situation is like. i dont want to get sick without any drugs or antibiotics.
Answer
Answer


Do you have a doctor who can prescribe antibiotics for you?

Answer Yes, I have a specialist in this area.

Expected Response: hi your do a lot better just starving it out of you body and system drink lots of fluids no need for drugs a lot better that way once things stop slowly restart eating keep of fried foods light soups will do till get back in the swing. good luck

Question: i have a hard lump in my left nostril on the wall between nostrils. should i be concerned? . it's not painful
Baseline Response: no, it's fine. you should be very careful with your mouth and your breathing.
Answer to question: "You need to do this, don't you?"
Answer with question: No, not at all.
You can use a syringe and a lot of syringes to help with your breathing, but there are two problems with this technique: first, it doesn't work well if you're not using a syringe. Second, when you're using a machine, you're doing it on your own. You can't use a machine that's made for you.
So, you could do this with a systolic blood pressure monitor, but you'll have to use a heart monitor.
I don't know if this technique works for me, but if you want to do it with a machine

Expected Response: mmm probably not. if this gets bothersome in terms of pain or bleeding or blocking sinus drainage then i'd definitely recommend you get it checked out by a physician. if it persists for more than a few weeks you may also want to get it checked out. it's rare to get cancer in that area though not unheard of but i'd consider that a longshot. more likely it's a cyst or something similar to a zit. as always if you find this lump worrisome make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider and have it looked at. take care!

Question: how long does the first herpes breakout take to heal? is there anything that can be done for relief other than warm h2o?
Baseline Response: if you are having a herpes breakout and you feel that your first herpes break is not progressing, you should seek medical attention.
The first herpes infection usually occurs in the first year of life, but it can take up to a year to get to the point where you can start to feel well. The first herpes virus usually starts in the genital area, and is usually spread by touching the infected skin. The herpes virus is passed from person to person by touch and can cause serious side effects. The symptoms of herpes usually include fever, rash, fever and itching. If you feel ill, or have a rash, try giving your health care provider a warm h1o for a few days to see if there is any swelling or itching.
You can also take a cold h1r to help prevent infection and to help you avoid more

Expected Response: herpes where? genital herpes can be effectively treated by several different anti-viral medications. shingles and cold sores/fever blisters are also herpes and may be treated differently. see your medical provider. warm water is not going to really do much.

Question: does gonorrhea cause pain. i was recently told by my local hospital i have contracted gonnoreha problem is i am in severe pain it makes my hips and pelvic area hurt so bad to were i can hardly move and cannot get comfortable i was diagnosed with hep c in 2010 and i have not been treated yet i am going in the am. i don't understand what is causing this pain no matter what i take nothing seems to help and the pain only happens in the am. i need help on this i have never had an std in my life. please help. thank you.
Baseline Response: no.

Expected Response: gonorrhea is one of the main causes of pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) and yes this can be very painful. you need to be under the on-going care of a primary care medical provider or gynecologist until this std has been cured. without the ability to examine you first-hand it would not be possible to determine the cause or significance of the pain you are experiencing now. only the medical provider who is treating you and has examined you can make that important call.
================================================================================
Question: do you remember a seizure. i do not remember anything i did not feel well i do have stage 2 lupus i take hydroxchlor my joints will swell in just a matter of 20 min. my daughter said i was walking and all of a sudden started shaking and was rigid starring and not breathing then i woke up to an ambulance ride to the hospital.
Baseline Response: i woke to a massive seizure and was rushed to the emergency room.

Expected Response: i don't remember anything. i was shopping with my family the last thing i remember is looking at a pair of boots with my daughter. my son said i looked up and then dropped and started seizing. my next memory is about an hour later in the ambulance. they were asking my name and i knew i should know the answer but could not come up with it.
================================================================================
Question: it burns or feels like a dull pain at the end of urinating. is this an infection or std? i'm with a new partner. it doesn't hurt to pee until the very end. i've had an std before so i do feel paranoid about having another one. it doesn't feel like other uti infections that i've had but something just doesn't feel right. i started sleeping with my new boyfriend 2 weeks ago and ever since then is when this discomfort began.
Baseline Response: it's a very common and painful condition that can cause severe pain and may require surgical removal.

Expected Response: hi have you thought of cystitis could be just that this what happens with new boyfriends its just your body reacting to the change. if not just go get some tests done try an std/gum clinic. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what antibotic is used for imflamed protitis. the inflamed lining is not healing just being irritated every time i use the bathroom. i've been using lialda 2 tablets a day and a mesalamine rectal suspension enema 4g/60ml not everyday but every 2 days. still no relief. i was sick on my stomach yesterday and this morning still bleeding when i have small bowel movements. this is my first time since having protitis every experiencing this. was dx with uc 2007 it went to just protitis in 2010 have never had any problems until now
Baseline Response: this is what im doing to my esophagus. this treatment is not the first time this has happened. im going to go to the doctor and ask them to make sure this is not a side effect and that it is a side problem. i am just going to ask them if they are able to help me and that i can take it to a doctor who can prescribe it

Expected Response: i think you are talking about prostatitis -- a prostate infection/inflammation that can have many causes. the treatment depends on the presumed cause and the severity of your condition so it would not be wise to self-treat this problem. see a urologist so you can be properly examined expertly diagnosed and treated based on those findings.
================================================================================
Question: help my husbend cant remimber like he use to. he smokes tobacco and weed he stopped drinking over 4 months ago. and he is losing weight he has a new friend and the guy comes over every day and does not leave till late. then my husband has been real restless at night. he cant even remember where he put his wallet even just after 2 hours. he has adhd that he has had since he was a child and never med treated. other then that he is in good health.
Baseline Response: he smokes cigarettes and weed and he wasnt even trying to quit. and also he is still not getting any help from anyone.
The only thing that has helped me is that I know my husBend has been smoking, it's been a good week, and he has been in good shape. he is going to be back.
I have tried to contact my hus Bend and he told me he would be back in 2 hours, but I

Expected Response: there is really little that can be done over the internet other than to offer you some advice. i don't know your husband's complete medical history or have any way to medically evaluate his memory issues but he does have some obvious contributory factors: tobacco marijuana use poor nutrition (a guess) insomnia due to unknown factors and perhaps many many other issues. he will need to see a medical professional to start the evaluation process assuming you will be able to convince him to do so. encouraging him to give up tobacco and marijuana may be futile but at least you can try and work on him.
================================================================================
Question: what are the maximum out-of-pocket limits associated with the new aca?
Baseline Response: the minimum amount you can keep your own home and keep your income from going out of control.
Answer, in general, is that you should have a balance sheet with enough money to maintain the balance sheet.
You might be able to keep your home for a while but you might need to sell your house for a lot more money.
When you make your financial decision, you should consider what kind of financial situation you have and what kind you want to live in.
How much you can afford to put on the mortgage and what kinds of investments you want in the house
The answer to the first question is that if you can't afford to have a mortgage, then you can get a loan from someone else.
If you can make it through your first year of college, then it might be possible to get a mortgage.
It's also possible to put down a mortgage

Expected Response: in 2014 the maximum a single individual will pay out-of-pocket in 2014 will generally be $6 350 while a family could pay up to $12 700. these include deductibles and any co-pays or co-insurance payments. this is true for most consumers including those whose plans are purchased in the exchanges but people covered by employer plans with pharmacy benefits administered by a different company than the primary insurer may face higher costs for drugs in 2014. this difference goes away in 2015.

Question: began with extreme itching and some redness between last two toes and around toes. used otc cream to treat athletes ft. itching increased and now blisters are appearing. how to treat?
Baseline Response: this is a really simple technique that I have been using since my last training session in March. I feel like I have a good grasp of the problem and am trying to get it right.
The first thing I did was to use a non-repetitive method that I learned from the first training session. I used the following methods:
1) In order to get the problem, I first needed to get out the pain.
2) I used a soft tissue massage. I then took my hands and feet to massage the pain and then I started to massage them. I took the pain off them and then rubbed them.
3) I then used the soft tissue to massage my skin. I rubbed the skin off my toes and then took the skin away. I

Expected Response: this still can be tinea pedis (athlete's foot) - caused by a fungus. so keep using the antifungal creams on a regular basis. not all antifungal medications are equally effective so if you fail to improve on one you can try a different kind. ask your pharmacist for help. sometimes when the skin breaks down a person can have a secondary bacterial infection that complicates treatment. if you feel you feet getting infected you will need to see your medical provider.
================================================================================
Question: can you get pregnant from anal sex even though you are still a virgin?
Baseline Response: If you can't, you can get pregnant by anal sex. The only thing you can do is get pregnant and be a virgin.
How does anal sex affect my pregnancy?
When you are a virgin, your body will develop a hormonal response to your vagina and anus. The hormonal response is the result of the vaginal opening opening opening (usually called a "globule") that is the part of your body that contains the fluid. It is a hormonal reaction that can be triggered by your vaginal opening and anus opening.
You may also experience the following symptoms:

You feel a lot of pressure on your cervix.

Your body feels very wet.
: Your cervix feels very dry.
. Your body feels tired.
, your cervicose tissue starts to dry up.
"I've never felt so wet in my life."

How is

Expected Response: ok thanks but i have something last. if the hymen factor is broken(from any way) she is not a virgin. so i think that a girl who is still a virgin and has anal sex has minor possibilities of getting pregnant
================================================================================
Question: can exercise flatten your abs?
Baseline Response: Yes, you can. You can do this, but only if you are going to lose weight.
This is the most important part of this exercise:
Do not get too close to your body.
Keep your arms straight, with the elbow in front of your shoulders.
Do NOT push the weight down.
If you feel pain in your upper back, you will have to lift up and lift it.
You can use your hands to hold the weight. (This is also a good exercise if you're going to use your arms to hold a weight, but not for exercise.)
Do this to your face, and then repeat until you feel like you are losing weight. Do this to the side of your face or face to the floor.
Try not to push the weights down too much.
It is best to do this every time you have a bad back.
I am not a strength coach. I

Expected Response: hundreds of crunches each day won't flatten your belly if you need to lose weight. if your abdominal muscles aren't covered with excess fat strengthening them can help you look tighter and thinner. but spot exercises won't banish belly fat.
================================================================================
Question: id like to know can i take penicillin with allergy/cold medicine. i also take high blood presssure pills.
Baseline Response: -
It depends

Expected Response: if your medical provider has prescribed penicillin for a bacterial infection then yes. if you are self-prescribing penicillin for your "cold" then be advised that colds are viruses and penicillin does not work for viruses. when you have high blood pressure certain cold medications should not be taken so please consult your medical provider or pharmacist for advise -- someone who knows the exact medications you are taking or plan on taking. i do not have this information nor do i know your medical history.

Question: are there disadvantages to drinking fruits and vegetables from a blender instead of eating them as they are? . if i ate all the fruits and veggies i should it would take a lot of time every day to wash them cut off/out the inedible parts and chew them. i must sound desperately lazy but i'd love to save time by washing and trimming 4-5 days' worth of produce at once throwing it all in a blender and drinking it over the next four days. would i digest produce less thoroughly if i drank it instead of chewing and salivating? would the puree lose any nutrients sitting in the fridge for a few days? thanks!
Baseline Response: Yes. There are some downsides to drinking fruit and vegetables without a blender. The first is that the fruit and vegetable are not as absorbent as they can be in a water-based blender. A blender is often used in conjunction with a food processor to reduce the amount of sugar in the food. The second

Expected Response: whether you chew them up. or a blender chews them up and you drink them does not make any difference. you are getting the same level of nutrients.
================================================================================
Question: can you catch a cold from getting chilled?
Baseline Response: we were able to get a cold, but we didn't get it from the fridge. It's just that it's not that cold, so if you're going to be in the cold for a long time, you need to get used to the cold before you can get used, because it's a bit of a headache.
A: Oh, I can tell you that.

Expected Response: this is one of the most persistent myths about colds. the only way to catch a cold is by being exposed to a cold virus. cold air may irritate an existing condition such as asthma which would weaken your immunity. this could make your body more receptive to a cold virus but only if you come in contact with it.

Question: fainting nausea dark loose bowel associated with irritable bowel syndrome. i have symptom similar to irritable bowel syndrome. usually it happen very sudden acute stomach pain urgency to go to bathroom dizzy fainting nausea even vomiting. in addition i have dark and loose stools it has been this way for long time. i have this kind of episode several times. should i see doctor?
Baseline Response: Answer 1:
1) I don't know if it is a normal bowel movement or an irritable stool movement. but it might be a good thing to get a doctor's opinion.
2) I have been using a lot of pain relievers and they do not cause a problem. they are not like a drug that will cause a big headache or a bad trip.
3) I've been taking a lot and I have very little pain in my stomach. my stomach is going to get hurt and it may be hard to eat.
4) I feel like

Expected Response: him you have what my wife had many years ago all the same but as they say she grow out of it i think at one time she was put on fibre gel because of the very loose stools so the could help you to. but from what i have heard ibs is just apart of growing up adult style some get it and us others don't. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what should i do if i take an overdose of sporanox capsules?
Baseline Response: there are many ways to do this.
1) First, you can use a pain reliever such as Tylenol (or other pain relievers), or a painkiller like Vicodin.
2) You can use your own medicine to help relieve pain.
3) You could use a nasal spray (for example, naloxone), or an ibuprofen (for pain relieving nasal spray).
4) You might try to take a pain medication (such as aspirin, ibupriate, or a medicine called Prozac) instead of sporpionox capsules.
5) You probably need to take your own medication to reduce pain. You should also take some form of medication to get rid of the pain. If you have any other problems, please let me know.
6) Try to avoid taking other medications that can harm your body.

Expected Response: if you think you took too many sporanox capsules call your doctor or local poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.
================================================================================
Question: i have a really bad oder coming from my vagina even after i washed it
Baseline Response: i'm sorry, i'll give you a break, i've been there before. I've been in all sorts of situations where i've had a bad omen. So i'm not sure about this, but i've found it really hard to find a reason to make myself look so bad.
Answer of the day: i've got a really hard time getting my boobs back on. i'm pretty sure there is no way i could find a way to do it for you.

Expected Response: vaginal odor is often a sign of infection typically a bacterial or trichimonas so you may need to see your medical provider for an examination. another common cause is a retained tampon (even if you think this could never happen).
================================================================================
Question: when i get upset i feel nauseous i can't beathe and my stomach hurts i get really depressed. should i talk to a doctor? . i was just wondering if i should see a doctor. when i get upset i feel overwhelmed. i can't breathe my stomach starts to hurt and i feel nauseous. i feel alone and really depressed. i can't do anything i use to enjoy with the same enjoyment. this can last for a couple days. it's something that occurs quite often. i was just wondering if i should see a doctor or if this is okay.
Baseline Response: i have never experienced any side effects of this medication, i was taken orally for about 2 days. i have always felt ill, but i feel that i am able to take it. i do not know if this medication is able to relieve the symptoms of depression or if i can treat it.

Expected Response: no this is not ok. yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist. depression is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it. the same is true of anxiety which might be what you're experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe. you are not alone in your feelings. many people experience the same things which i hope brings you comfort. a doctor can help you figure out what's going on and suggest treatment for you. you deserve to live a happy full fulfilled life. you're worth it. personally i do not believe in taking antidepressants without "talk therapy" (also called cognitive therapy). i think you might benefit from a combination of both and i encourage you to seek this help. i wish you all the best!
================================================================================
Question: my egg was released on cycle day 15 and i had unprotected sex on cycle day 12 could i be pregnant? . my periods are usually 29-30 days per month. my last period was sept 29-october3. i had unprotected sex and my partner did not pull out and on the 13th i'm pretty sure i ovulated because i had one bad cramp in my lower right abdominal area that lasted about 24 hours. is there a possibility of pregnancy?
Baseline Response: It is very unlikely that a woman will conceive with me.

Expected Response: hi having unprotected sex 2 to 3 days before day 14 yes you could end up being pregnant but for some women having unprotected sex anytime of the month means pregnancy just one of those things. all you can do is wait to see if you miss your period then get a test done either an hpt or see your doctor. hope this helps. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what can i do to help with arthritis in my feet on the bottom of my feet and they hurt badly
Baseline Response: I do what I can to help. The problem is that I have a couple of different types of arthritis. I think most people will agree that I am doing the following:
1) make sure that I use a pain reliever to help relieve pain in my foot.
2) make my feet feel better and they feel better.
3) make me feel better while I am on the treadmill.
4) make it more comfortable to walk around.
5) make them feel better, and better. I also recommend that I take a break from exercising or exercise a little. I can also use my body to get the pain in and out of my foot better. That's why I do my exercises.
6) make the pain worse.
7) make that pain worse so that I can exercise.
8) make those pains worse. I

Expected Response: it may not be arthritis at all. if it is on the bottom of your feet it could be plantar fascitis. see a podiatrist for a proper examination and treatment which could be as simple as getting different shoes to special orthotics (shoe inserts). arthritis can also be improved by using nsaids (a class of drugs that includes ibuprofen and naproxyn).

Question: i am taking the bupropion xl generic does it work the same as wellbutrin xl?
Baseline Response: yes butrin xv.
Answer 1: i got the following error:

Could not find xl.

Answer 2: i just got the xl from the xv site

Solution:
, i just created the xs from the site and the xll is already there.
,

, can you please tell me what xlls are?

-

This is my answer to the first question. i tried the xlc generic but the xls generic works.
.
 "This is the xm generic of the xr generic of xv".

. "I have found a generic for xl of the yl xl".
. I need to find the xc generic of yl of xs

and so on.
 and so on and so forth

Expected Response: most helpful answer generic medications contain the same active ingredient(s) as their brand-name counterparts. they may contain different binders and inactive ingredients. in the u. s. generic drugs are regulated by the food and drug administration (fda) and are required to meet the same quality standards as brand name drugs. research has shown that generic drugs work just as well as brand name drugs. that said there are always slight variations in purity and strength between batches of mass-produced medications. this is true of all drugs that are mass produced both name brand and generic. the fda regulates how much variation is allowed and it's not very much. if you have recently switched from a brand-name medication to a generic version and feel it isn't working as effectively you should talk to your health care provider about it. he or she can help you determine the best course of treatment. best wishes to you!

Question: could a vaginal longitudinal septum affect me getting pregnant? . in december i was diagnosed with a vaginal longitudinal septum (no extra or split organs just the septum) that would require surgery. my boyfriend and i have been trying to conceive for almost 10 months after farther research i found that couples can be considered infertile after trying to conceive for 12 months with no success i was wondering could this septum be the reason we have had so many troubles getting pregnant?
Baseline Response: I am not sure how much of a problem this problem is for us, but it is definitely an issue for me as i was not even aware that this sepsis was a problem until i found out i was pregnant.

Expected Response: hi reading through this link should help you understand what your problems are and how they can be overcome. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. couples have tried far longer than 12 months and still get pregnant mostly its all down to timing and being relax and stop trying then it will happen. do hope this is of help to you. good luck

Question: i'm 7 days late for period and got a faint second line on pregnancy test this morning. i'm i pregnant or not? . have been trying for months to get pregnant. i am now 7 days late for my expected period and having pretty bad stomach and abdominal cramping. i have noticed constipation last couple weeks as well as muscle cramping in my legs. headaches come and go much more frequently and are worse with stress. i took a first response pregnancy test this morning and got a very faint second line. i don't want to get my hopes up what do i do now? am i pregnant?
Baseline Response: i am 7 days pregnant and i was told i am at the beginning of the month, but i didn't have any. i just went to the doctor. i was given a dose of a medication called a dexamethasone and I was told my stomach was fine, but it was still too much for me. i went to see the doctor and

Expected Response: i have no way of blindly determining if you are pregnant over the internet so i would suggest that you repeat the pregnancy test in a week to see if the results are more definitive or call your medical provider to order a more-sensitive blood pregnancy test. don't be too anxious. if you are pregnant you will be pregnant for quite a while. if you are not pregnant you should know in a few more weeks when the tests fail to show evidence of a pregnancy.

Question: can fillers replace plastic surgery?
Baseline Response: yes.
Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5395906

Expected Response: fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn “i-was-strapped-to-a-747? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery can’t take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they don’t answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as i’ve said many a time one shoe does not fit all.

Question: what causes ringworm of the scalp or beard?
Baseline Response: there are two main causes of ringworm.
First, the hair is not a good source of dye, because the hair grows very thin and does not absorb much of the dye.
Second, the scalp is very sensitive to the hair dye. A hair that grows long and not short will not absorb the dye well.
In addition, the skin is very susceptible to the dye and it is difficult to remove the hair from the scalp.
So, the reason why there are a lot of different types of ringworms is because the skin of the ear is very rich in these compounds.
There are three kinds of ring worms.
One, the ringworm is found in the hair.
Two, the earworm is the most abundant of the three.
Three, the beardworm is more abundant.
When these are the three, the average age of the ringworms in the ear and beard is around

Expected Response: ringworm infection is caused by a fungus. fungi that cause ringworm live and multiply on the upper layer of the skin and on the hair. ringworm is not caused by a worm or other parasite. the medical term for fungal infections is tinea followed by a word that describes the location of infection. for example tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp and tinea barbae is ringworm of the beard. ringworm of the scalp is most commonly caused by the fungus trichophyton tonsurans which is spread from one person to another. this fungus causes more than 90 out of 100 cases of ringworm of the scalp in north and central america. 1 in the past the fungus microsporum canis was the most common cause but it is a less frequent cause now. microsporum canis is spread by cats and dogs. ringworm of the beard is caused by trichophyton verrucosum and is spread by cattle and other farm animals. you can catch ringworm by sharing contaminated hats combs brushes towels telephones clothing sports equipment or even theater seats and by direct contact with an infected person. children are more susceptible to the fungus and more likely to develop an infection than adults. adults often do not develop an infection even after exposure to ringworm-causing fungi. adults and less commonly children can be carriers for ringworm. carriers can pass ringworm on to others but do not have symptoms of the disease. ringworm-causing fungi can live on people objects (such as hats or brushes) or animals for several months. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: lately i seem to be overly moist during sexual intercourse
Baseline Response: I have never had any problems with my semen. I would love to know how it feels to have it in my body.

Expected Response: there may be no logical reason for this occurrence. it just happens and should not be considered a problem. lubrication during sex is a very complex event but typically the greater the excitation the greater the lubrication. you and your partner must be doing something right. there is really nothing medically that can be done to change the amount of lubrication your body decides to emit.
================================================================================
Question: if you have a cold can you take zyrtec in the am and nyquil at night.
Baseline Response: Yes, you can take a cold. You can take Zyrtec at night and you can get a cold by taking a cold pill.
1. It is not necessary to take Zortec or a cold powder in order to obtain the cold.
2. The cold powder is cold and you should take it with you.
3. You should not take a powder that is cold. It will cause the cold to become more intense and will make you cold. If you want to use a cold medicine, you should be able to take it.
4. You must take the medicine as soon as possible before you take the cold medicine.
5. If the medicine does not work, you may not take it until after the cold has stopped.
6. If it does not start working, you must not take the medicines again after the medicine

Expected Response: you can do that if you tolerate both medications well. try to do without medication as much as possible especially toward the end of the cold because sometimes the backlash reaction from coming off antihistamines (like zyrtec) can make it seem like your cold is lasting longer than it should because it can make your nose stuffy when you are coming off it.

Question: im 19 my penis is under 5inch when erect. is this normal? help i'm scared to have sexual intercourse.
Baseline Response: It is normal.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance. and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal. i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size. society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of "masculinity " after all. i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size. but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist. he or she can examine you and tell you if everything's ok. also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isn't measured based on the erect organ. rather penis size is measured by "stretched penis length. " the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor. i hope this helps set your mind at ease! don't worry about it. the average penis in america is 6 inches. i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine. she says it is just right and doesn't hurt her. you are probably going by the magazines and movies. trust me they are not normal sized. we are created individually and when you find mrs. right she won't care. there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length. they do work. it is a slow process but it can be done. also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate. again its a slow process but it is possible. there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on. also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself. if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you. if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly.

Question: my 7 yr old son found a roundworm in his dirt pile & now i am freaking out. does he need to be tested for roundworms? . my 7 yr old son thought he found an earthworm in his dirt pile but as soon as i seen it i knew it wasnt a earthworm. i believe it is a roundworm & now i am freaking out b/c he plays in his dirt pile every single day. i know that he has gotten some of this in his mouth b/c him & a friend were throwing dirt at each other & some was thrown in his mouth. does he need to be checked for worms?
Baseline Response: I believe that he does not need to check for worms. I have seen him find worms in his food & he does NOT need to take them to his doctor. i have seen a 6 year old boy find worms on his body & he is freaking out because he is tired of seeing worms. his mom just gave him a

Expected Response: not all round worms are human intestinal roundworms. i am not sure what he found but the roundworms that you are concerned about live inside his colon not in a dirt pile. you can certainly have him checked if you want (stool specimen) but if he is not having any intestinal symptoms of worms he may not have anything

Question: having sex with two different guys a day apart and on my menstrual. i do know that the two guys are clean and so am i but iam worried since i didnt use protection and since ive heard that you can get so many diseases when you have your menstrual and you have sex. if i can please get some answers iam really worried. if i can end up getting a diease or even having the ability of getting pregnant.
Baseline Response: i am not sure how to answer this question but i'm sure you can guess the answer. i am so happy to hear from you.
Your Response: "Yes, I am happy to be able to get pregnant and have the ability to get a life. However, this is a personal decision. I'm going to be very honest with you and tell you that I am very happy to have sex with you. I know that you will all be very happy with me and you will be very upset with me if you don't

Expected Response: most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?

Question: what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?
Baseline Response: there are many ways to prevent or treat osteoarthritis.
Solution:
1. Make sure you are getting the right nutrients.
2. Make your food a healthy source of calcium, vitamin B6, iron and zinc.
3. Make a healthy diet.
4. Eat organic, plant based foods that are free of any artificial additives.
5. Try a diet that is simple to follow.
6. Try out some of the free vitamins and minerals in your diet. If you find a new way to get better results, start using it now.
7. If your body is too fat, it will not be able to absorb more nutrients. You will not get the same results from exercising.
8. If it's too cold, it won't be able or able to take vitamin B12.
9. You may have to eat a lot of vegetables

Expected Response: here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. 1: control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. 2: exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. 3: avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. 4: eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega-3 fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.

Question: how can i get rid of dark acne scars?
Baseline Response: I'm currently working on a project to make an alternative acne scar marker for women who have had a lot of acne on their face. I hope that this will be the next step to making a marker that can be used in the future for acne scarring.
I'm looking for an alternative marker that is less prone to acne scars.
It's a simple, inexpensive, easy to use marker that will be made from a small piece of plastic.
To use it, you simply place the plastic on the counter and wait for the plastic to dry.
Once it has dry, you can remove it by pressing the plastic against the counter.
After it has dried, the marker will be ready to be used.
For the most part, I'm not worried about the results of my new marker.
The only problem is that it's not easy to find.
There are a lot more things to do

Expected Response: a combination of glycolic or salicylic acid chemical peels topical hydroquinone (a bleaching cream) and topical tretinoin can help lighten dark scars.
================================================================================
Question: will testosterone injections reduce sperm count?
Baseline Response: yes, it is possible to reduce sperm counts, but only if you know that you have a high level of testosterone.
I don't think there is a high enough level of serum testosterone to be able to tell the difference between men and women.
The other point is that it is not clear that it would be possible to have a pregnancy that would cause a change in the level of male sperm count.
It is also not clear what the normal level of sperm counts is.
There is no scientific evidence that testosterone injections have a negative effect on sperm counts.
Is it possible to decrease sperm count without reducing the level?
There are some studies that show that testosterone can lower sperm count, and that some studies show that it does not.
That is not a good idea.
What is a good thing?
It makes your life easier and more productive.
How does testosterone affect your reproductive health?
If you

Expected Response: hi and yes it will lower your sperm count all the way to zero it just like a male pill. here's a link from webmd just more info <link> good luck

Question: what are prophylactic medications for migraine headaches?
Baseline Response: a migraine headache is a severe headache caused by a specific type of migraine (in this case, migraine headache with mild headache). The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed description of the common migraine headache medications.
For the purpose of the present article, migraine headaches are usually defined as a headache of the head, neck, or face. This headache is most commonly seen with the head and neck, but may also be seen with other parts of the body.
In addition, migraine is characterized by severe headaches that are not easily treated, usually with prescription medications. The medications can be prescribed over a period of time. However, there are certain medications that may be more effective than others.
A migraine headache may be seen when the head is not moving or the neck is tense. This can be because of an imbalance between the head's movements and the head itself. The headache may also occur because of a migraine

Expected Response: prophylactic medications are medications taken daily to reduce the frequency and duration of migraine headaches. they are not taken once a headache has begun. there are several classes of prophylactic medications: beta-blockers calcium channel blockers tricyclic antidepressants antiserotonin agents and anticonvulsants. medications with the longest history of use are propranolol (inderal) a beta-blocker and amitriptyline (elavil endep) an antidepressant. when choosing a prophylactic medication for a patient the doctor must take into account the drug side effects drug-drug interactions and coexisting conditions such as diabetes heart disease and high blood pressure.

Question: what would cause severe continuous pain on both ovaries? . the pain has been continuous since october 28th the doctors have done ultra sound and cat scan. the test showed a follicular cyst on either ovary. the most recent test has shown cysts are gone. still in severe pain nothing relieves the pain.
Baseline Response: you are correct. what caused the pain is not clear.
I have never seen a doctor who does ultrasounds on ovaries. I have seen no doctors who do ultrasounds and have never had the pain in my ovaries resolved. I had a very difficult time getting my ovary back up and working on it. I think I could do a second procedure.
As far as I am concerned the only thing that could cause the pain was the way the test was done. the doctor had to do an extremely difficult and very hard test that I am not sure how they are doing.
The doctors said no more tests because they are

Expected Response: it may be cysts.
================================================================================
Question: what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?
Baseline Response: pregnancy planning is a way to plan for your child's future. It can help you to understand what your child is going to do and what your family needs for their future.
How many pregnancies you have can change your life, but you can never be sure that your child will have all of your choices.
When you have a baby, you're taking care of him or her.
If you have an abortion, you can take care of your child until you're ready to get back to work.
You can't wait to have your baby.
What do you do when your child has a pregnancy and you can't find a partner?
Your child's life is important.
Your baby will have a strong and healthy body.
There is no one right way to go about your pregnancy.
It's not easy.
One way to get your child healthy is to get a healthy pregnancy test.

Expected Response: having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving (see medical issues below). women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.

Question: what are the chances i have hiv after escort? . hello i am 20 years old. i had intercourse with an escort about 4 days ago. there was about 2 times that the condom slipped off inside her but only briefly. i didnt finish. about 3 hours after she left i began throwing up in the shower and started to feel sick. i thought it was due to lack of sleep in the past few days and also a slight hangover. it is 4 days later and i have been having what seems to be a flu. diarrhea threw up a few times body aches. what are the chances this is hiv? .
Baseline Response: hiv is a very rare condition. It is usually found in people who have HIV. It can happen to anyone. If you are a HIV positive person and have HIV, you have been exposed to hiv. hiv can be transmitted to your family members. If your family is infected with HIV, then you may be at increased risk

Expected Response: hi sounds more like you do have flu. your find it take around 6 to 8 week for hiv to show up i would just go see your own doctor for some flu tests and a general check up. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what are psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs?
Baseline Response: psoriasis is a type of joint pain. It can be caused by any of the following causes:

- an imbalance of the muscles in the joint that allow for the joint to contract

The muscle that is attached to the joint. This can include the muscles of the neck, hips, back, knees, and elbows.

Prisal joints. These joints can be the same muscles as the joints in your lower back, hip, and knee joints.
, and, the muscles that are attached to your lower hip, hip and knee joint. The muscles of your lower leg, hips and back joint.
- pain that can lead to pain in the back

Other joint pain that may occur.
. These joint pain can include pain in your upper back, lower back and back of your back.
 - pain in other parts of your body.
 .

If you have

Expected Response: in most patients the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. the arthritis frequently involves the knees ankles and joints in the feet. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a "sausage. " joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called "mutilans" can cause rapid damage to the joints. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis. aside from arthritis and spondylitis psoriatic arthritis can cause inflammation in other organs such as the eyes lungs and aorta. inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (iris) causes iritis a painful condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. corticosteroids injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent blindness. inflammation in and around the lungs (pleuritis) causes chest pain especially with deep breathing as well as shortness of breath. inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valve valves leading to heart failure and shortness of breath. acne and nail changes are commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. interestingly these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. acne has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. in fact a new syndrome has been described characterized by inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) acne and pustules on the feet or palms thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis) and bone inflammation (osteitis). this syndrome is therefore given the eponym sapho syndrome.

Question: if you do sex every alternate day on the week of your ovulation will you be pregnant with a boy? . hi. my doc told me to try to every alternate day after 12 days from 1st date your period started. . i am want to get pregnant with a boy and i know if you have sex on the day of ovulation your chances of having a boy increases coz there is a chance the y chrome will get attached to the egg. as i dont know the exact day of my ovulation and if i have sex every other day from day 12 is there a chance i get pregnant with a boy? . thanks.
Baseline Response: if your ovulatory period starts on the first day of your period your chance of getting pregnant increases to 1st day of the month.

Expected Response: that is silly advice but you do have a 50/50 chance of having a boy (or girl) no matter when you have sex. every day or every other day. chromosomes are inside the sperm and egg. the "y" doesn't really attach to anything. the fastest sperm is often the one that impregnates you so if you want a boy all you can do is hope that the sperm swims like michael phelps. there are many old wive's tales about techniques to improve your chances of having a boy or girl but in the end those techniques are no better than a coin toss. if you get what you want you will praise the method you used. if you don't you will not recommend it to anyone. so let nature make the decision for you and don't stress out about the sex of a baby that has not been conceived yet. just hope for a happy healthy baby.

Question: if our home is free of bedbugs how could we get them? do they come with us or things we brought from outside?
Baseline Response: If we're home free of them, they will come with the home. If we bring anything that's a bedbug, they won't come with it. If they come, they'll come with whatever we brought. If you don't want them to come with you, don't let them come with your furniture.
In fact, if they're free of the bedbugs, they're not free of your furniture!
So if you're in a place where they're a little bit too loose, they might come with stuff they don't need.
We've seen that a lot of people are worried about being in bed with a bed bug.
But if you have a home where they don`t come, you're probably fine.
It`s not like the bed bug will come back. You just have to deal

Expected Response: your coworker the person sitting next to you at the movies that secondhand sofa you just bought -- all might be carrying bedbugs. they’re real hitchhikers.

Question: what is antibiotic resistance?
Baseline Response: it is the use of antibiotics to kill bacteria in the gut. It is also known as "therapeutic antibiotics". The first antibiotics were used in the early 1900s to treat the bacteria that cause fever. Today, most of the antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections are used to kill viruses.
Source: The American Society of Microbiology.
The bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics are the ones that cause the most harm. The bacterium that causes infections is called Bacteroidetes. It can be found in the guts of many animals, including humans. These bacteria are resistant mainly to the antibiotics that are used in treatment.
When a person is exposed to antibiotics, he or she may develop a fever. The fever can occur in the form of vomiting or diarrhea. If the person does not get enough antibiotics, the person may develop pneumonia. The person may also develop pneumonia when the person is too young to be able to carry out

Expected Response: antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria or other microbes to resist the effects of an antibiotic. antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in some way that reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of drugs chemicals or other agents designed to cure or prevent infections. the bacteria survive and continue to multiply causing more harm.

Question: outside of hormone therapy what other measures can be taken for painful intercourse after menopause? . penetration hurts if girth of penis more than 1 and a 1/2 inches thick
Baseline Response: no, penetration is not a penis size measurement.
Answer, penis size is not an accurate measure of girth.

Expected Response: this is a vexing problem for post-menopausal women. i'm sorry you're going through it. while hormone therapy (often estrogen cream delivered directly to the vaginal tissue) is usually recommended to help with the dryness and atrophy (shrinking) of the vagina after menopause other options are available. assuming you're not allergic to any of the ingredients you could try an over-the-counter vaginal moisturizer such as replens brand. this is not the same thing as lubricant used during sex. a vaginal moisturizer works to keep delicate vaginal tissues moist and supple. at least that's the theory. i don't know about the science behind it but it probably can't hurt. there are several brands of vaginal moisturizers on the market. an old-fashioned method to maintain vaginal tissue health is the boric acid suppository. ask your gynecologist about this. you can have boric acid suppositories prepared at a compounding pharmacy. they work to help moisturize and maintain the ph of vaginal tissue. most important don't give up. keep talking to your gynecologist about the problem because new products and strategies for dealing with vaginal dryness are constantly being developed. wishing you well!

Baseline Response: This is a common and serious issue and is usually triggered by a number of factors. Firstly, it can be very difficult to separate and focus on the symptoms. Secondly, it is not uncommon for people to experience pain. If you are struggling with pain, or even experiencing some pain, you may have difficulty concentrating. Thirdly, it may be difficult to concentrate.
What is the best way to deal with the headaches?

Question: my daughter takes an antibiotic for impetigo and eye drops for allergies. can she take something to reduce her fever?
Baseline Response: Answer
Answer 1:
A person with an impetigant allergy should be given an antibiotic. This can be taken with or without food.
Answer 2:
An allergic person should not take an antibiotic if the allergic person is allergic to a particular antibiotic.
A patient should not be given antibiotics if there is a change in the body fluids of the patient.
An impetile is one who is allergic not to the antibiotic. An impetilis person who is not allergic to the drug should not receive an antibiotic or should not have an allergic reaction to the drugs.
The drugs taken by an imposter are usually given to an impotent person who has an impulsive reaction to one or more drugs. If the imposter is unable to take the drug, then the drug is not available.
In a case where

Expected Response: before making any recommendations i would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using. . it is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any over-the-counter fever reducers. so it is likely to be fine. i would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughter's fever based on her age weight and the other medications she's taking.

Question: is it ok to put clorox on a ring worm? my mother used it on me as a child and so did my husband's mother.
Baseline Response: yes. I was actually using a clorax ring worm for a year. I had a very good understanding of the basics of clorix. I didn't have any experience with clorizum.
I was able to do a lot of research, and finally came up with a method of cloriography.
It was a very simple procedure, and I was able do it for quite a while. It took a long time to get the results I needed, and it was very difficult to follow the steps correctly. I ended up using it a couple times, but the results were pretty good.
This is what I found out.
The cloriograph was a tool that I use to visualize my clorions and I used it to make a graph of the clorid surface. The

Question: can patients with advanced prostate cancer enroll in clinical trials?
Baseline Response: yes.
The prostate cancer screening tool is available through the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP).
Patients with advanced cancer are screened for prostate cancer by a panel of specialists, including cancer registrars, prostate cancer specialists, and family physicians.
Patient screening is available for women at risk for prostate-related death.
Pregnant women and women with a history of breast cancer or other cancers are screened.
Adults with prostate cancer who are at increased risk for other cancers and other causes of death are screened at the same time.
In some states, screening for prostate cancers is not available at all.
If you are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and you are concerned about your ability to screen for prostate tumor, visit your state's public health department.
You should also check with your doctor to see if your prostate cancer diagnosis is likely to be missed.

Expected Response: researchers are exploring several new ways of diagnosing monitoring and treating prostate cancer. clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of these new methods and treatments. there are risks and limitations in every clinical trial. for example you may be assigned to the "control" group and not get the new medicine. or the new medicine may not work. but clinical trials also offer early access to new treatments. you can find out more about clinical trials by asking a medical oncologist inquiring at an academic medical center or browsing a clinical trials listing service. webmd lists clinical trials at my. webmd. com/medical_information/clinical_trials/default. htm. the national institutes of health lists clinical trials at www. clinicaltrials. gov.

Question: my egfr is 50 what is egfr and what is a good number for egfr
Baseline Response: for eg fr, I would say you have to be between 50 and 50.
Answer #1: 50 = 50.00
Answer 2: 50 is better for egf.

Expected Response: egfr is an estimate a test to check your kidney function and is done when a doctor thinks you have or are at risk for kidney problems. it combines a few pieces of information including age blood tests and your sex to determine how well your kidney function at filtering waste products. the work our kidneys do is truly astonishing when you recognize that they filter about 200 quarts of blood a day to product nearly 2 quarts of urine--- which is the byproduct of that filtration. when our kidneys fail toxins remain in our blood. a gfr test is a way to determine how well these organs function.

Answer#3: forazepam foradizetil
Answer4: fordilibotil fordihifadiz
Answer5: fornapomol fordiclofen
Answer6: forlodal fordipen

Expected Response: read the step-by-step instructions for using foradil capsules with the aerolizer inhaler in the medication guide given to you by your healthcare provider. do not use foradil unless your healthcare provider has taught you and you understand everything. ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any questions. children should use foradil aerolizer with an adult's help as instructed by the child's healthcare provider. use foradil aerolizer exactly as prescribed. do not use foradil aerolizer more often than prescribed. for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) the usual dose is one foradil capsule inhaled through the aerolizer inhaler twice a day (morning and evening). the two doses should be about 12 hours apart. for preventing exercise-induced bronchospasm the usual dose is one foradil capsule inhaled through the aerolizer inhaler at least 15 minutes before exercise as needed. do not use foradil aerolizer more often than every 12 hours. do not use extra foradil aerolizer before exercise if you already use it twice-a-day. if you miss a dose of foradil aerolizer just skip that dose. take your next dose at your usual time. never take two doses at one time. do not use a spacer device with foradil aerolizer. do not breathe into foradil aerolizer. while you are using foradil aerolizer twice a day do not use other medicines that contain a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (laba) for any reason. other laba medicines include serevent diskus (salmeterol xinofoate inhalation powder) and advair serevent diskus (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder). do not change or stop any of your medicines to control or treat your breathing problems. your healthcare provider will adjust your medicines as needed. make sure you always have a short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine with you. use your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of foradil aerolizer. call your healthcare provider or get medical care right away if: your breathing problems worsen with foradil aerolizer. you need to use your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine more often than usual. your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine does not work as well for you at relieving symptoms. you need to use four or more inhalations of your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine for two or more days in a row. you use one whole canister of your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine in eight weeks time. your peak flow meter results decrease. your healthcare provider will tell you the numbers that are right for you. you have asthma and your symptoms do not improve after using foradil aerolizer regularly for one week.

Question: i was diagnosed with influenza a ten days ago. i still feel nauseous and have loose bowel movements. is this normal?
Baseline Response: no. your body does not produce antibodies to the virus. Your body will not produce these antibodies. This is normal.
How do you know if your body is producing antibodies to influenza?
This is an important question. You may not have symptoms and your symptoms are not a sign of a fever. However, if you have symptoms, you may be infected with influenza.
Is there any way to tell if you are in the virus or not?
There are two types of antibodies, both of which are called antibodies. The first type of antibody is called a fluorescence. It is very hard to see because you cannot see the fluorescence because of the surrounding material. This fluorescence is called an antibody.
The second type of antibodies are called a lytic. This antibody is a virus that is resistant to a particular type of flu

Expected Response: this is a great question and i'm so glad you asked. many people associate gastrointestinal upset (nausea diarrhea) with the flu (influenza) but actually the true flu doesn't usually produce any of these symptoms. sometimes people refer to the "stomach flu " which is actually a condition called "gastroenteritis. " the nausea and diarrhea you're experiencing likely are caused by something other than influenza a. have you by chance taken antibiotics recently? if so that class of medications can cause gastrointestinal upset. this condition usually gets better after you finish the course of antibiotics. you also should consider eating yogurt or taking a probiotic to help with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. be sure to drink plenty of water whenever you have diarrhea -- and wash your hands thoroughly in case you're carrying a bug that can be passed to others. if the diarrhea doesn't clear up within 14 days or so another trip to the doctor is in order to try to figure out what's causing the problem. wishing you well!

Question: i am having trouble swallowing my food. it feels like i the food wont go down. i have very little teeth. i want to eat but every time i do the food won't go down and i end up having to throw it up.
Baseline Response: i have no food. i just know it is too hard to swallow. i am getting very tired. i was looking for a food that would go down quickly and i found the right one. i got this one and i was like "oh wow, this is awesome."
Answer/Response: i'm very happy with my food and am so glad to have found it. i think my food will go down soon, but i will have to take care of it.

Expected Response: you need to see your doctor right away if you are having trouble swallowing your food. there can be many possible causes for trouble swallowing. some can be very serious. here are a few of the things that can cause difficulty swallowing: • the esophagus (the tube that runs from your mouth to your stomach) may be partially blocked by a tumor or web. it may also be narrow due to severe reflux. • a swelling in a surrounding area such as the thyroid or lymph node may be pressing in on the esophagus. • there could be a problem with the nerves or muscles that are involved in swallowing • poor teeth can be preventing food from being properly chewed • diseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may prevent the esophagus from moving the food along webmd has a very good article on difficulty swallowing that can give you some more information. but do call your doctor now and make an appointment to have this checked out.

Question: i am confused because my dr says to stay on a low protein diet because my ammonia level is 151. . however my total protein test is low at 5. 6 won't this effect my total protein result?
Baseline Response: i have a test kit and i have been told that the test will show no ammonia results. so i guess i'm not sure why i'm confused.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: usually when ammonia is high there is trouble with the liver since it is the organ that breaks down protein to ammonia. it is no longer standard practice to subscribe very low protein diets with liver disease (i'm not sure how much your doctor is recommending). the key is to eat the right amount of protein -- not too much but not too little. the total protein measures the amount of protein in the blood which could be affected by your diet. i recommend seeing a registered dietitian who can explain to you the amount of protein you need and how it relates to all of your blood levels. read more: total serum protein ammonia blood test

Question: i'm breastfeeding and didn't realize peptobismol wasn't safe. i only took 1 dose how long should i avoid breastfeeding? . i got norovirus and the stomach pain has been awful so i took one dose of peptobismol without realizing it wasn't safe for breastfeeding. i just researched it and all sites basically say to avoid it due to the risk of reye's syndrome and other risks to the baby. how long should i avoid breastfeeding?
Baseline Response: i've been taking my meds for the past 5 weeks and i don't see any risk for any of the adverse reactions. i'm still breastfeeding, so i don' think i should take any other meds. i don´t think i'll get any of them until i'm sure. i haven't tried any of their other drugs (like the ones i've tried). i just think i need to do more research.
Answer : i've already researched this, but i don`t

Expected Response: breast feed your baby. the chance of you or your baby getting reye syndrome or having any consequences after one dose. for the tiny amount of salicylates (aspirin) in the pepto bismol. would be highly highly unlikely. what is more important is that you stay well-hydrated and nourished until the virus has abated. if this is not possible you can temporarily switch the baby to supplemental formulas or any stored breast milk until you are up to the mission again. get better. you baby will be fine if you resume breast-feeding.

Question: how long before i can i return to sports like the one that injured my finger in the first place? . my middle and ring fingers got caught in the elastic waste band of my opponents shorts as i pulled their flag. both fingers injured but i felt a "pop" in my middle finger. i squeezed the middle finger from the top and bottom and felt something move and the discomfort decreased a great deal but on day 3 after injury and wearing a splint i no longer have range of motion whereas i did have full motion on the day of injury.
Baseline Response: i have to return to the sports that i love so much and i have been watching this game for over a year and have not had a problem. i would like to have a chance to watch the game again.

Expected Response: most helpful answer a release to "return to sports" will need come from your medical provider -- the one that examined you for your injury. healing time is so very individual that it would be impossible to blindly determine when you can play sports again since i cannot examine your fingers to see if they are healed. as much as i would like to help you with your question this is not something that can be done over the internet.

Question: diagnosed with anxiety have stroke symptoms weakness onleft side leg and arm is this normal?
Baseline Response: this is normal.
What is the difference between a person with an ASD and a person without?
The difference between an ASD with an autism and an autism without is very different.
In the first place, an ASD does not have any brain abnormalities. This is due to a mutation in the gene called the plastid gene.
This mutation is found in the brain of an ASD. This mutation is usually found in parts of the brain where the brain is normally functioning.
The first

Expected Response: if you have symptoms of a stroke it's important to seek immediate medical attention. one-sided weakness can be a sign of stroke. here are other common symptoms: sudden vision changes sudden problems walking sudden severe headache sudden inability to speak most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case. if your one-sided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor. i can't think of any reason why anxiety would cause one-sided weakness. i suppose it's possible it could be a medication side-effect but this still deserves to be checked out. i suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible. best wishes to you!

Expected Response: unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs like florida are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. but you may be misinformed about what you are and are not eligible for. your roommate's income for example doesn't count toward your household income simply because you share a home. you would need to file taxes together in order for your incomes to impact one another for health insurance subsidies. open enrollment is now closed for the year but if you recently lost your job and health insurance you may qualify for a special enrollment period. if you do you might be eligible for private insurance at highly subsidized rates. i suggest you go to healthcare. gov and perhaps pick up the phone to speak with someone to make sure you've explored all of your options.

Question: is a cortisone injection merely a pain reliever or temporary remedy?
Baseline Response: Cortisone injections are a pain relieving medication that can help people with a number of pain conditions. For example, when a person has a sore throat, a sore jaw, a headache, or other severe pain, cortisones can help them get the medications they need to heal their symptoms.
How does a corticosteroid work?
Cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) is a fluid produced by the spinal cord, and is used to transport corticosterone, a hormone produced by muscles in the body. Corticosterone is produced by spinal cord cells, which are the cells that make up the spinal fluid. Cortisol is released from the spinal cords to the blood through the circulation of the blood-brain barrier. CFS is the most common type of CFS.
What happens to the corticostriatal cortisoid?
The cortic

Expected Response: corticosteroids are not pain relievers. they reduce inflammation. when corticosteroids relieve pain it is because they have reduced inflammation. while the inflammation for which corticosteroids are given can recur corticosteroid injections can provide months to years of relief when used properly. these injections also can cure diseases (permanently resolve them) when the problem is tissue inflammation localized to a small area such as bursitis and tendonitis.

Question: my granddaughter has to have a gluton free diet what can i feed her? . she has stomach pain alot and she has a cousin (her aunts child) that is allergic to gluten so they want to put her my granddaughter on a gluten free diet to see if this helps her. i need to know what i can and cant feed her and what i can substitute so she still gets nutrients she needs. with out it costing me an arm and a leg im on a rather small income but want to do whats best for her.
Baseline Response: I am trying to feed my granddaughter gluten free.
I have been trying to do this for about 3 months now. I have had to buy a few items for her to get her food. I will try to feed her. I do not have a lot of money so I can not afford to feed it. I am trying for 2 days now and then she can eat it but I can't because it is not gluten free so

Expected Response: gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products. people on a gluten-free diet often avoid wheat rye and barley; though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well. a gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meat/poultry/fish and many dairy products. unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy. if not buying fresh food it’s important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as gluten-free. for example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging. the food industry can use gluten in many products that don't seem like they would contain gluten so it's important to always read the label first. having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well. it may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have. the basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods. the person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet. review this webmd article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes. well she has celiacs disease (non life threatning disease) but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like ( some chex mix cerals corn tortillas some soups any thing that says gluten free on the label

Question: is caffene important in insulin control and weight loss?
Baseline Response: Caffene is important for both insulin control (i.e., weight loss) and weight reduction (i

p. 5). The goal of the study was to investigate the effect of caffen on insulin sensitivity and insulin sensitivity by measuring insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion in overweight and obese patients. The primary objective of the experiment was to evaluate whether caffening significantly reduced insulin secretion and insulin resistance.

Methods:

We recruited 15 patients with type 1 diabetes (defined as an individual who has an insulin-dependent insulin resistance) who were in the usual range of insulin levels for at least 2 years. All of them were at least 1 year of age and were receiving physiologic insulin therapy.
, and were in a normal range of glucose (0.4 ± 0.4 mmol/L) and insulin (0, 0.6 ± 0,

Expected Response: no. caffiene is not important at all. humans like it but they don't really need it.

Question: i need an over the counter steroid cream for periferial neropathy what is a good one that would work?
Baseline Response: An over the top steroid cream with a little bit of sugar to help with the healing process. The cream will also help to help the skin to heal better.
Also, a bit of caffeine, some vitamins, and a little vitamin C to help it stay active.
The cream is a little pricey, but I'd recommend it.
I'm not a huge fan of over the heat but I have a few allergies and would love it if it worked for me.
If you have any questions about this product, please leave a comment below.

Expected Response: over the counter steroid creams will not help peripheral neuropathy.

Question: i've been on medication since 2000 for my multiple sclerosis. this year in april i fell into the doughnut hole. . my medicine cost went up extraordinarily high from $27. 50 last year to $55 in january $144 in april and each month it was starting to go go higher. it came to the point i was no longer going to be able to afford my medication so i called around and found some help with my medicine through the chronic disease fund. why after all of these years is this happening to me?
Baseline Response: because of my disability. I have an autoimmune disease, my skin is very sensitive to certain substances, and my immune system is very strong. i have been living with this for over a year now. i can't even stand it anymore. i started to lose weight. i was very scared when i first started seeing a doctor. but now i can see it. i am 100% satisfied with my life. i feel like my body

Expected Response: when you enter the part d prescription-drug "doughnut hole " you pay a higher percentage of your drug costs. the doughnut hole starts once you and your plan have paid a total of $2 970 toward your medication costs. this year you do receive a discount of 52. 5% on covered brand-name drugs and 21% off generics until you've reached the end of the coverage gap ($4 750). that's when catastrophic coverage kicks in. you might want to also look into medicare extra help which helps pay drug costs for people with low incomes.

Question: i have a potassium level of 2. 8 from a blood test. is this bad? . i have muscle cramps and aches in every major muscle. i also have pneumonia and i am a diuretic steroid and antibotics

Expected Response: if that is the true reading it is critical.

Question: what's the best skin lightening cream; i am darker skinned?
Baseline Response: this is a very important question. It is a simple one. It will help you keep the skin lightened. It has two main parts. The first part is to help the skin get into its natural state. The second part is the one that will keep the shine from getting to the point of fading.
The first part of the skinlightening cream will help the moisture from the skin shine.
It will keep you moisturized and healthy.
To help you to keep the moisture of your skin from getting too intense, it is best to use a moisturizer (like the ones used in the sun or the anti-aging cream)
To keep the water from getting into the skin, you will need to use the moisturizer. It may seem like a long time but it is not.
If you use a lot of moisturizer, you'll need to keep it in the

Expected Response: to brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with. typically that's something called inflammation. that inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin didn't like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan. even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin that's more blotchy or uneven. if you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma. so we use brightening creams to help lighten this. the gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called hydroquinone and this i prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product that's used and how long it's used for. hydroquinones can also be combined with over-the-counter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like niacinamide. and green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin. that's the word i don't like using. these are brighteners and not bleaches.

Question: how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .
Baseline Response: i am a retired health care professional and am a resident of a city in south america. i am looking to start a new life in my new home. i will be taking the drug as soon as possible. i would like the drug to be discontinued because i am sure it will cause heart failure. i have been using simvasteatin for 3 years now. i can tell you that i am not a drug addict or a

Expected Response: i went through all the test in the hospital. i was told i had a heart of a 27 year old. my doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure. they went in and found a blockage--widow maker. they did a stent. surgeon stated i would have been dead within 30 days. so much for test. you can try red yeast rice and naicin. naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor. i take both and my readings are 90/72. try it capsules do not cost very much.

Question: what is this rash that won't go away? this began as a few small bumps on my feet. . after a few weeks my feet were completely covered in red itchy bumps. my dermatologist then prescribed me topical steroid cream and also oral steroids and antibiotics. this cleared it up in about 10 days. it then came back in one general location on each foot. for a while it would go away then come back in the exact same spot on each foot. it would ooze horribly and itch like crazy. it would look clear then come back. after a while i have developed hives on my arms legs stomach and back.
Baseline Response: it's been a while since i've experienced anything like this before. i got a call from my dermatology doctor in the afternoon and she said my eyesight was getting better and she was taking a few more pictures of my face to see what was going on. i was a little concerned but she told me that it was not normal

Expected Response: probably the itchy rash that comes and goes is dermatitis commonly known as eczema. you can apply aloe gel cream with curcuma glycyrrhiza majishta (rubia cordifolia). internally start with herbal combination of curcuma tinospora and majishta at dose of 3 gms daily.

Question: i've had white noise (with corresponding hearing loss) in my left ear for 2 months. what causes it and can it be fixed. i have had an mri -- negative for tumor ms or anything else that might be causing it.
Baseline Response: i have a hearing loss that is very severe. I have had a very long time to cure it and it has been going on for almost 2 years.

Expected Response: hearing loss would generally be caused by a problem with the ear or a problem with transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. it sounds like you have had tests to detect any brain or nerve problem. i would have to assume at this point you have also seen an ent (ear nose and throat) doctor to have your ear thoroughly examined. sometimes it can be tough to identify the cause of ringing in the ears or white noise-type sounds like you describe with associated hearing loss. the only recommendation i can offer at this point is to work closely with an ent doctor to keep searching for what might be causing it as the list of possibilities is lengthy. based on your symptoms i am not able to tell what might be going on. i am sure you have done quite a bit of research on your own at this point but a search on "hearing loss" on webmd will bring up a host of useful information. to get started here's information on the most common causes of hearing loss. did any doctor call it "tinnitus? " if that's what it is here are some reasons why you might have it that i found. not sure though that this is helpful if you do not have tinnitus. "the most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging (presbycusis) but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises (acoustic trauma). tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. other possible causes of tinnitus include: a buildup of earwax. medicines especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. ear infections or eardrum rupture. dental or other problems affecting the mouth such as temporomandibular (tm) problems. injuries such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. a rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position such as when bicycle riding. blood flow (vascular) problems such as carotid atherosclerosis av malformations and high blood pressure (hypertension). nerve problems (neurologic disorders) such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. other diseases. these may include: acoustic neuroma. anemia. labyrinthitis. meniere's disease. otosclerosis. thyroid disease. most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. you may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms does not get better or go away or is in only one ear. there may not be a cure for tinnitus but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. i also found this article on home treatments: <link>

Question: me and my boyfriend had sex early friday morning on my 18th cycle day. will there be a chance i will become pregnant?
Baseline Response: I will be able to have a baby in the next month, and I will do my best to be able.

Expected Response: here is a link to a slideshow about fertility and ovulation that i think you'll find very helpful. it states: "while the exact timing of ovulation can vary on average it happens between day 11 and 21 of your cycle. a brain hormone called luteinizing hormone (lh) surges triggering the release of the egg that's most ripe. at the same time your cervical mucus changes to a slippery egg-white consistency to help sperm make their way to the egg. " so there is a chance that you could be pregnant if your ovulation cycle fits this pattern. the webmd answers staff

Question: will running help me lose weight?
Baseline Response: no, but running does not solve the problem. In fact, it is far less effective than running.
In my opinion, running is a great way to gain weight, but you can't gain weight in a way that is more efficient.
Let's take a quick look at some of the most common bodybuilding bodybuilding exercises.
If you want to see a complete list of bodybuilding, bodybuilding tips, and bodybuilding tricks, read the complete book on Bodybuilding.com.

Expected Response: running certainly does burn lots of calories and if you're running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if you're putting all that energy into running. but even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldn't lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned. the bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do. running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. however i would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging. start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session. you can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging. eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking. from there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging. a couch to 5k program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging. it’s important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury. if you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight. the extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise.

Question: what are the treatments for ulcerative colitis?
Baseline Response: There are many different treatments for this condition. These include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and antibiotics. Some of the most common medications used to treat ulceration are:

Antibiotics: antibiotics are the most effective treatment for ulcers. They are used to kill bacteria in the body, so they can be used in your body. These antibiotics are not very effective, but they are very effective and may help you with your ulcer. Antibiotics are usually given as a first line of defense, but sometimes they are given as an aftercare treatment.

Treatment for ulicosis

In the following sections, we will cover the treatment of ulcerated ulcer, ulcer ulcerata, and ulcerous rectal cancer.
, ulculitis, and colitis

When it comes to ulcer infection, there are several different types of bacteria that are responsible for

Expected Response: both medications and surgery have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. however surgery is reserved for those with severe inflammation and life-threatening complications. there is no medication that can cure ulcerative colitis. patients with ulcerative colitis will typically experience periods of relapse (worsening of inflammation) followed by periods of remission (resolution of inflammation) lasting months to years. during relapses symptoms of abdominal pain diarrhea and rectal bleeding worsen. during remissions these symptoms subside. remissions usually occur because of treatment with medications or surgery but occasionally they occur spontaneously that is without any treatment.

Question: why is it important to know that pregnancy complications put me at future risk for heart disease?
Baseline Response: I have not been diagnosed with heart disease, but have been diagnosed as having a heart condition (heart failure) in the past. I am currently receiving a heart transplant from a family member who has been in a heart attack for years. My family believes I have a heart defect, but my medical history shows that my heart has not been functioning properly. This is why I have been unable to take any medications.
Source: Dr. Paul A. Deutsch
I am still not sure if my heart was broken or not. I know that my doctor told me that my blood pressure has dropped so low that my body is very sensitive to my blood. This was the first time I have had any heart problems. I have never had any sudden heart attacks, but I have suffered from a lot of problems with my heart and my kidneys.
How much do you need to take in

Expected Response: ”these complications are an opportunity to detect early that there is a problem ” says [american heart association 2011] guideline chair lori mosca md phd. mosca is director of preventive cardiology at new york-presbyterian hospital and a professor of medicine at columbia university medical center in new york city. you can then follow up with your primary-care doctor to evaluate your overall cardiac risk and quickly start appropriate prevention strategies. “if you developed gestational diabetes follow up and say ‘what can i do to prevent heart disease and diabetes? ’” she says. your doctor may recommend weight loss aggressive lifestyle changes and possibly medication she says. “we are unmasking a problem early so that we can prevent full-blown cardiovascular disease. ”

Question: are hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine related?
Baseline Response: I don't know. I don�t know what to make of them. I�m not sure what they�re called. I would say that hydroxyze is a different kind of hydroxyzone. It�s a different sort of hydrolyzed compound. I think that's what the word is for.

Question: if i had sex with one person and had my period 6 days later could i get pregnant? . i had sex with one guy on 4-1-2013. started my period on 4-6-2013. it lasted till 4-10-13. i had sex with a different guy on 4-9-13 and have been with that same guy since. i found out im pregnant. which was 5-3-13. i went to the er for bad cramps and back pains. they took blood and told me my hcg levels were low and to come back on 5-5-13. the levels had gone up. is there a chance my child is the first guys?

Question: if i have oral herpes can the girl get it if we have vaginal sex dont kiss or have oral sex but dont use a condom?
Baseline Response: yes it is possible to have oral and anal sex.
Answer 1: Oral and anal intercourse is a safe, safe and effective way to get herpes.

Expected Response: i think what you're asking is: can you transmit genital herpes to your partner if you have oral herpes but you do not perform oral sex on her. and the answer to that is "no. " you also can't give her oral herpes if you don't kiss her. herpes is transmitted by direct contact. i applaud your concern about not transmitting herpes to your partner. however what concerns me more here is the issue of safe sex in general. how do you know she doesn't have genital herpes that may be transmitted to you? she could have genital herpes and not even know it. or she could be infected with humanpapillomavirus (hpv) and not know it. in fact she could have several sexually transmitted diseases and be unaware of it. why would you take chances with your reproductive health by not practicing safe sex at all times? plus of course there's the issue of pregnancy. do you want to become a father? are you ready to become a dad? because it's possible if you're having unprotected sex. no method of birth control is 100% effective but you can increase the effectiveness of any birth control by using "redundant systems" (to borrow a term from computer science). in other words even if your partner is using some form of birth control you can also use a form of birth control (in this case a condom ) to make sex even safer in terms of pregnancy prevention. again i think you're very wise to be aware that you have oral herpes and to be concerned about not transmitting this virus. i hope you think about the other issues i brought up too.
================================================================================
Question: what should i do if i suspect an overdose of oxytetracycline-polymyxin b?
Baseline Response: I am not sure how to answer this question. The information provided by the FDA and the FDA's website should not be taken as definitive or as a substitute for any prescription medication.
Answer 1: As stated in the "What should i know if I suspect an opiate overdose?" question, the FDA advises that a prescription medication should not contain a preservative that is not "preservative-free." The preservative preservative is a natural preservative. The FDA's "preservatives" list is not the same as the FDA preservative list. The preservatives listed on the FDA website are the same preservatives that are found in all other medications. Preservatives may contain a wide variety of other preservatives, including the following: Sodium Hyaluronate (SHT), DHA, Glycolic Acid, Sodium Sulfate, Xanthan

Expected Response: this medicine may be harmful if swallowed. if swallowing or overdose is suspected contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.

Question: vaginal discharge that appears white on underwear but is yellowish on tissue itching burning general discomfort help? . the burning just started a day two ago but there is constant discharge and it appears white in the opening and kinda dries and chunks together on underwear but when wiped with a tissue without urinating it appears to have a yellow tint. i have never had a yeast infection so i am not sure if i have one or not.
Baseline Response: I have no idea.
1. The yeast is very sensitive to pH. I have been using a pH-control solution of 2.5. It has a pH of 10.7, so it is a good pH for me to use. I do not know how long it takes for the yeast to multiply and to reach a higher pH.
2. The pH is only 3.5 but it has been reported that the yeast is active during pregnancy. I am sure if you are pregnant, if you get sick and you are concerned about

Expected Response: hi if this discharge is of a cottage cheese type and if there is a fishy smell with it your find that its bv bacterial vaginosis for this the treatment is antibiotics or if your against them try sea salt you do this bu taken warm sea salt baths twice a day for info google sea salt and bv lots of info. do hope this helps. good luck

Question: std incubation period. i was with my usual partners within one week of coming into contact with a person that i believe has an std. what is the incubation period before i am able to pass along the std? could i have infected my usual partner?
Baseline Response: i am not sure what time it was, but i did not want to have to wait for this.
Answer : i am very happy with my condition.

Expected Response: there are many stds. and each one has their own "incubation period". needless to say if you had unprotected sex with someone who has an std you are at risk. find out what kind of std. or better yet get tested for all of them. use a condom next time and you won't need to worry.
================================================================================
Question: how do i prevent baby bottle tooth decay?
Baseline Response: It is a common problem that the baby bottle is not properly cleaned with soap. It is a normal procedure, which is why it is recommended that a professional is called to clean the bottle. The doctor will provide you with a prescription for the procedure and a prescription to get you to go to a dentist. The dentist will give you a number of tests, such as:
A blood test to see if you have high blood pressure or are on medication.
A urine test to look for any sign of infection.
An x-ray to see any signs of bleeding.
The dentist will check for any signs or symptoms of tooth decay. If you have any problems, you can go to your doctor to get the tooth done.
You can also take the toothpaste out of the bottle and take it to the dentist. This is very important to know.
There are many methods of toothpaste and this is one

Expected Response: the good news is that a few simple steps can help stave off baby bottle tooth decay. they include implementing good oral hygiene at an early age. here's how: wipe the baby's gums with a clean gauze pad or washcloth after each feeding. begin brushing your child's teeth without toothpaste when his or her first tooth comes in. clean and massage gums in areas without teeth. floss once all the baby teeth have come in. make sure your child is getting enough fluoride which helps reduce cavities. if your local water supply does not contain fluoride ask your dentist or doctor how your child should get it. schedule regular dental visits by your child's first birthday. dentists also offer special sealant coatings which can help prevent tooth decay in children. these are expensive however. other techniques to help prevent baby bottle tooth decay include: not filling bottles with sugar water and soft drinks. bottles are for milk water formula and special electrolyte-containing solutions when the child has diarrhea. juices mixed half and half with water to avoid empty calories are a way to interest your child in a "sippy cup. " soft drinks are not recommended for children as they have no nutritional value. never allowing your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing anything but water. never giving your child a pacifier dipped in anything sweet. decreasing your child's sugar intake especially between meals. it's never too late to break bad habits. if your child drinks sweetened liquids from the bottle and/or sleeps with a bottle break the habit now and reduce the risk of baby bottle tooth decay by: gradually diluting the bottle contents with water over two to three weeks. once that period is over fill the bottle with water. remember that healthy baby teeth will lead to healthy permanent teeth.

Question: i take 40 mg pravastatin doctor wants it at 80mg. i can't afford new meds can i take 2 40mg tabs instead of the 80mg?
Baseline Response: it's not the same as using the 40mg pravaster, it's the same amount of pravestatin that's given to my body.

Expected Response: well technically yes you can take two 40mg pills instead of one 80mg pill but that just means you'll run out of medication faster. i suggest you consult your pharmacist to find out exactly what the cost difference is between the 40mg pills and the 80mg pills. you may find there's very little price difference at all. also i suggest you discuss the cost factor with your doctor. there may be an alternative medication he or she can prescribe that is less expensive. health care providers tend to be very sensitive to cost issues on the part of their patients so don't hesitate to bring this up with your doctor. wishing you all the best.

Baseline Response: If you are a regular, you should drink water at least once a day. Drink only water in the morning and then when you are not at work you should go to your room and drink water. Do not drink any water in your room or shower. You will not feel any relief from the issue.
Answer to question: If urinating is not a problem, you could try a urine test to determine if you have a problem with urination. If you have problems urinating you could also try a blood test. A urine test is a small sample of urine taken from your body. If it

Expected Response: he needs to see his medical provider so he can be properly examined and diagnosed. frequent urination could be related to a prostate problem a urinary infection or even diabetes.

Question: how acurate is a chlamydia home test? . my husband has been cheating on me. today he went to the doctor to test for stds. the doctor forgot to order a chlamydia test. my husband refuses to go back to the doctor or spend any more time in testing clinics. he might be willing to use a chlamydia home test from walgreens (if i buy it! ) how reliable are the results from such a test?
Baseline Response: this test was very accurate. the tests were done on a 3 week old girl and the girl is 6 months old. the results are good enough to give an accurate diagnosis. if you are looking for a chlydia home lab check out this blog.
I am also wondering if this test will work for me because of my age and my allergies.
Answer - I'm a 19 year old woman. I have asthma, so I was considering using this test. I was told that it would not

Question: is there a surgical procedure to remove exess skin from the penis? as in a circumcision that didn't heal properly. when i was 13 my mom took me to the philippines to have me circumcised and ever since then i don't think my penis healed properly as there is some excess skin still hanging off.
Baseline Response: yes.
When i was 14 i got my first surgery and after that i went to the hospital to get a urethra removed. after that my penis started to turn black but after that it did heal.
You can see that the urethral opening is still open at the base of the penis and the base is still there.
In my case, i was a pretty young girl and i was wearing a tight fitting t-shirt and a t-button. my father took me in a room in the hospital and he took me back to my parents home. he told me that my parents had been circumcised and that my father had been in

Expected Response: yes this can be surgically fixed. you would need to see a urologist. this would most likely be a simple office procedure to remove this extra skin if you find it to be a cosmetic issue.

Question: can lice treatment be used again for a second day in a row?
Baseline Response: yes. You can use lice therapy, but the main treatment is to remove the lice from the body. You should also avoid touching or touching lice in a way that makes them uncomfortable. If you are experiencing a severe allergic reaction, such as an allergic reaction to lice, you should seek medical advice immediately.
You can also learn more about the lactic acid response in a lab by checking out the laryngoscopy article on the FDA's website.
Please note that the FDA does not require you to take lice medications in the same way as other medications. The FDA does require you not to take any lice medication if you have severe allergic reactions to louse, or if you are taking any louse-specific medications.
If you have any questions about this article or the licalycin product, please contact the FDA at:

Question: can a patient request a double appointment with their pcp if they need more time to ask questions without paying extra? . senior citizen patients specifically?
Baseline Response: a patient requesting a double-initiated appointment with the PDP can request the same appointment if they have been previously referred for a double procedure. The patient will then be notified of the double-inspection and the patient will be asked if they would like to pay extra for a second appointment.

Expected Response: in my opinion yes. you can request more time. the medical provider has a way of up-coding the visit so they get paid a bit more by medicare or insurance companies. as a paying consumer (regardless of who actually pays) the doctor really works for you. your paid consultant so to speak. i really feel that they should spend extra time especially if requested by the patient. not all medical maladies can be evaluated and cured in ten minutes (or less)! if your medical provider is not agreeable perhaps it is time to shop for someone who will be compassionate enough to spend the time necessary to meet your needs.

Question: painful clusters of whitish bumps on california and inside the "lips" on vagina. painful white cyst like clusters covering cautious and lips of vagina
Baseline Response: it's really painful. a painful and painful cluster of white cysts on the vaginal walls. the white cystal structure is what gives the "blubber" on the vagina the distinctive feeling of having "bloody, red and swollen" in the vagina. the vaginal wall is a very sensitive area and should be protected.

Expected Response: california? i am not sure that you meant to type the name of a state. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine that nature of your painful bumps based solely on a vague description. you will need to see a medical professional for a proper examination and perhaps so diagnostic tests to get a definitive answer. i encourage you to do so.

Question: can exercise help with a hiatal hernia and do alcohol or tobacco have any effect on (pantoprazole) protonix?
Baseline Response: not at all. The fact is that it is not possible to develop any permanent effect on the protonic brain.
As a rule, if you are a smoker, you will not be able to develop the anti-inflammatory effect of alcohol or nicotine. This is because you will be able only to develop anti-inflammatories in the brain. So, while it is possible to create anti-lammatories in your brain, you cannot create anti.
So, you are not able to improve the anti. You will have to develop a new anti. But, you can have anti. So I would say that you are better off without any anti. In fact, you should not develop anti. The only way to develop one anti is by using it.

Expected Response: exercise has no effect on hiatal hernias. exercise however can increase acid reflux in people who are prone to acid reflux presumably those individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter muscles. exercise increases intra-abdominal pressure and can force stomach acid back into the esophagus through a weak lower esophageal sphincter. the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the effectiveness of protonix or related drugs (proton pump inhibitors or ppis) are minimal. however both alcohol and tobacco aggravate the underlying acid-related conditions for which protonix is used and they should be discouraged.

Question: what's a safe simple heartburn treatment?
Baseline Response: a simple heart burn treatment.
The common problem with a heartburn is that it can be quite painful. It's usually caused by a combination of a bad breath, a bad muscle relaxant, and some other factors. It can also cause a lot of pain and even death.
For the most part, we know that a simple, simple heart attack is a good idea. But, there are a few things that can get you into trouble.
To get you in trouble, you need to get your blood pressure down. This is a simple way to keep your heart rate down.
You need to do a lot to keep the blood pressure up. You need to take a lot more than you take.
But, you can't just take it as an excuse to get up and go to the bathroom. You must do a whole lot of things to get the blood to your heart.
I'm not saying

Expected Response: many doctors and pharmacists suggest over-the-counter antacids for occasional heartburn. if heartburn symptoms persist your doctor may suggest drugs such as aciphex prevacid kapidex prilosec protonix nexium or zegerid to reduce the stomach's production of acid or reglan to make the stomach empty itself faster. your pharmacist or your doctor can explain how each drug works and what to expect.

Question: can e-coli be spread from one person to another an if so how?
Baseline Response: when i read a book i would read the first book and then read the second book and so on, which is just as much the same as it is the first one. But the e-cellulae are not spread from person to person, they are spread from body to body and so forth. So it is only in the first e-celulae which e-cells are spread and in the second e-Cellulae that e-cells are spread.

Expected Response: many ways. e. coli is a bacteria that lives in the colon so it can be transmitted to another person by contaminated hands toilet seats objects that are contaminated with poorly-washed or unwashed hands or foods that are not washed carefully (like vegetables) or meats that are not cooked thoroughly. it can also come from contaminated water such as streams lakes or wells.

Question: can imodium turn your stool dark?
Baseline Response: no. Imodium can turn your white stool dark.
How do you know that it's not your white?
How can you tell if it's your white or not?
It's hard to tell.
Do you really want to know?
Can I take my stool off my stool if I'm feeling upset?
Is it just a side effect of my white stool?
Do I need to take my white to be able to see it?
What about my white being dark or dark green?
I think it might be a side effects.

In my stool, I take it off my white. I think it's a side-effect.
If I have a side reaction to white stool I take a lot of my stool with white in it. I take white as a side

Expected Response: as a pharmacist if i had a patient who came to me and asked me this question i would actually be a little concerned. i would ask them for how long they have been taking the imodium and when did they notice this change in their stool color. sometimes when we here about dark stools there is a concern that there is some internal bleeding going on. so as a pharmacist my recommendation to this patient would be to stop taking the imodium and get it checked out by a physician or healthcare provider immediately.

Question: what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?
Baseline Response: blood is not drawn to the vagina. It is taken from the vagina by the mother. In the first week of pregnancy, blood is drawn to your vagina.
What causes bleeding?
There are a number of factors that affect the bleeding of the first-trimester.
Blood is drawn from the vaginal walls, especially in the vagina, to help reduce the risk of infection. This is because the vaginal wall is the only barrier to your vaginal bleeding.
You may have a hard time with bleeding in your first trimesters. If you have a painful vaginal bleeding, you may not have a bleeding problem for a long time. This can be because of the vaginal opening, which is not open, and the skin on the vagina is not dry.
In women who have had a bleeding episode, the vaginal lining of your uterus can become damaged. This makes it difficult to have your uterus removed and can cause

Expected Response: about 20% of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. possible causes of first trimester bleeding include: implantation bleeding. you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus. some women don't realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period. usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days. miscarriage. because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding. about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that doesn't necessarily mean that if you're bleeding you've lost the baby especially if you don't have any other symptoms. other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina. ectopic pregnancy. in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube. if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life-threatening to the mother. although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2% of pregnancies. other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness. molar pregnancy (also called gestational trophoblastic disease). this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby. in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus. additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include: cervical changes. during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix. intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding. this type of bleeding isn't cause for concern. infection. any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection (such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes) can cause bleeding in the first trimester.

Question: i'm overweight 40 and pregnant but exercise regularly. what should i do to maintain a healthy pregnancy?
Baseline Response: I think you should probably take some time off work and rest. I have a very hard time with exercise and I am overweight. If you do not exercise regularly, you could be at risk of pregnancy.
The last thing I want to say is that it's not about weight. I think it's about how you feel. You need to feel good about yourself. I want you to feel like you have a healthy weight.
I'm not saying you have to lose weight. It's just that you need to know how to manage your weight. And if you do, it will help you to know what to do to prevent pregnancy. It will help to be healthy, but it will also help you live a healthy life. I know it's hard to lose your weight because you need it to be there for you.
So, what is a healthy body?

Question: does exercise really boost immunity?
Baseline Response: Yes. It is a very important factor, but you need to keep in mind that the body is a lot more sensitive to exercise.
As you begin to get into your stride, your body will start to produce antibodies to protect itself from the elements. This means that you will be able to protect your body against the elements from the outside world.
The body is also very protective against diseases. It will try to protect you from certain diseases, but it will also try to prevent you from getting diseases from others. This is how it protects itself against certain diseases.
If you are in a relationship, you will have to deal with a lot of things in a very short period of time.
How long will you be protected?
When you are engaged in a romantic relationship, it is important to take care of your body. You should be aware of your health and safety.

Question: what can be done to improve sexual desire while taking pain medications?
Baseline Response: I have a lot of experience with pain medications and have tried many of them. I have never felt pain in the sense of, "Oh my God, I'm going to get a headache." I've never felt that. But I did find that I had difficulty taking pain medication because I had an autoimmune condition, and I would have a hard time getting my body to do what I was supposed to do. I was able to take a medication that helped me do that. I also had a pain reliever that helped my body with the pain. I think that's what I did.
I've had a lot more pain medications. I've had some of the most successful pain medications out there. I'm not sure if I can say that I've ever felt pain better, or if I've even experienced that.
What can you tell us about your experience with the Pain Relief program?
I think

Expected Response: one common side effect of narcotics can be sexual dysfunction including decreased desire and performance. medications like viagra and cialis may be able to help with performance but usually do not increase desire. for most people if there is decreased desire they may not be "inspired" to have sex. i remind patients that are on pain medications like narcotics that it is for quality of life and that if you don't need it at that time you may not have to take it. some people who do this may have improvement if their symptoms.

Question: does sleep while wearing socks & covering head is ok? . i've heard that it harms the brain & memory? is it true?
Baseline Response: yes, and that it is not a problem in any way. However, it can lead to problems for those who are not wearing socks.
1. Sleep deprivation is not an issue in most cases.
2. Some people experience sleep deprivation (i.e., sleep deprivation that is not caused by sleep deprivation) in their sleep.
3. Sleep restriction is not the same as sleep deprivation.
4. If you do not sleep, you will not be able to do anything about it.
5. There are many other factors that affect sleep. Some of them are:
a) When you are sleeping, you need to be able see what is going on in your body. b) When waking up, you must be able move and feel. c) When sleeping, the brain needs to process your sleep. d

Expected Response: not at all. you can sleep with a head covering and socks and it will not harm your brain or memory. whoever told you this is full of beans! in the distant past many people wore "sleeping caps" to bed. about 15% of our body surface is the head so keeping the head warm will help warm the rest of your body (including those cold feet of yours).

Question: i'm a retired woman who took social security disability retirement and i have private insurance as well. i am 59 years old. can you tell me what changes i will see in regard to my personal medical care once obamacare becomes completely immersed in our lives?
Baseline Response: No, we will be using the government's existing health care plan for our health care. We will also be able to purchase health insurance through the federal exchanges. We are not making any changes to the existing health insurance plan that we have already purchased. The only changes we will make are to reduce the amount of money that we will have to spend on medical expenses. We can't afford to pay for a private insurance plan. We also have to reduce our income. We have to pay down our debts to get health insurance. We cannot afford to have a private health insurance policy.

Expected Response: if you have private insurance you may need to switch to a new plan that complies with the law. if that's the case however you likely would have already received a notice from your insurer. it's likely based on your description that you will qualify for a subsidy so it's possible you'll see the cost of your private health insurance go down. take a look at healthcare. gov to begin exploring your options.

Question: what is infertility?
Baseline Response: it is a disorder caused by the body's lack of natural and healthy sperm.
A lot of women who are infertile have a lot of problems with their sperm, especially in the first trimester.
You might be surprised to learn that most of the problems with your sperm are in the fourth trimester, when you get your first test. The fourth trimester is when the body can't produce enough sperm to produce enough eggs to fertilize your baby.
The body needs a lot more sperm to create the egg. It has to get a lot in the second trimester to produce the baby. The third trimester is when sperm are lacking and the body needs more sperm for a healthy baby to fertilized.
How do you know if you are infested with sperm?
There are many things that can happen in the third trimesters, including:
Your baby's skin gets irritated. This can cause your baby to

Expected Response: not likely since you have been on this thyroid medication for over a year. look for other reasons. yes it can be related. my thyroid was removed in 1973 when i was 21 yrs. old due to benign adenoma. i took armour for 10 yrs. then switched to synthroid for 10 yrs. in 1991 i began having severe hives and red burned face. my family dr. immediately suspected thyroid meds. allergists insisted no way was it that. i suffered for 8 months until my gynecologist took me off synthroid hives immediately began subsiding then on armour and hives returned but looked different. took me off all hormone for 6 weeks and follow up with endocrinologist. said i would feel very tired - but i felt great. all my levels were normal and have remained so for 21 yrs.

Question: do cruciferous vegetables have anti-inflammatory benefits?
Baseline Response: yes. I have no idea if they are anti-inflammatories or not.
In the same way that the anti-aging benefits of cruciferously sliced tomatoes are not always obvious, the antiinflammatory benefits of some cruciferically sliced tomatoes have not been known.
The anti-ageing properties of crucified tomatoes are a matter of debate and there is no consensus.
Some people claim that the cruciferino cheese is more effective than the aged version.
However, I think this is a very difficult question to answer. I believe that the best answer is that there is a consensus. This is a difficult question because the information I have is based on a large body of literature, including a large number of studies and studies that have been done on the various types of crucible (like the crucifuge, or the crucifier).
I think that the most important question is the following: Do

Expected Response: the cruciferous vegetables — broccoli brussels sprouts bok choy kale cabbage and cauliflower — are “super veggies ” loaded with protective and powerful plant compounds such as sulforaphane. a new study from ucla linked sulforaphane with anti-inflammatory action in the body. sulforaphane stimulates an increase in production of antioxidant enzymes in the nasal airway which work to protect against tissue-damaging free radicals that we breathe in from pollution pollen tobacco etc. when we decrease tissue damage we are decreasing inflammation in the body. this is probably just the beginning of what this phytochemical does for us because sulforaphane appears to increase a whole assortment of antioxidant enzymes in the body — all potentially helping to protect the body. sulforaphane is just one reason to eat your cruciferous vegetables. recent research suggests that the components in these veggies are probably working together. research from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign suggests that one of the phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables crambene is more active when combined with another better-known phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables indole 3-carbinol.

Question: after giving me a blowjob my gf found a cold sore. is there a drug to reduce the chance that i'll get genital herpes? . after giving me a blowjob my girlfriend found a cold sore. the sore was very early stage and barely visible. 12 hours later it is still barely visible. . is there a drug i can take to prevent or reduce the chance or contracting genital herpes? . please help.
Baseline Response: I do not know what drugs are safe for you to use for genital herpes. I don't know how many different types of drugs you can take. You can take any combination of medications that are listed below. If you have any questions about drugs, please ask me. I will try to answer as much as possible.
1. Alcohol
2. Drug: Xanax
3. Alcohol: Ecstasy
4. Drug : Vicodin
5. Drug/Drug Interactions: Cocaine
6. Drug Interactions : Xanax

Expected Response: you could ask your doctor for an antiviral but your risk is fairly low. you wouldn't be getting genital herpes anyway - you'd be getting hsv1 that causes cold sores and that's much milder than hsv2 the virus that causes genital herpes. true you can get hsv2 on the mouth and hsv1 on the genitals but in general hsv1 is much milder and less problematic. you probably already have it on your mouth anyway about 80% of the human population have the virus. most of the time it causes no problems.

Question: i have taken seven days of flagyl for trichinosis. how long before my symptoms should be gone?
Baseline Response: i took seven days for trischinosis, two days for my tricholinosis, and then on March 2nd i was diagnosed with trichinephritis. the first day i was in the ER and the second day i received a CT scan. after taking the CT scan i was given a corticosteroid and a testicular biopsy. i was also given a CT and a CT showed a high level of trichomonotoxin in my blood. i also took tricholine. i have been diagnosed with my trischomonotoxicosis. i am in the second year of my diagnosis and i have seen a doctor and have seen my doctor and he is very helpful and very knowledgeable. i would like to know if you have any questions about tricholinesterase.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: you may be getting your trich mixed up. trichinosis is a disease usually contracted from eating undercooked pork. trichimoniasis is a parasitic vaginal infection that is usually treated with flagyl. if you treatment is not working then you need to contact your medical provider again. it is possible to have trich and also have another type of vaginal infection at the same time. unless your doctor did a culture and sent it to the lab this may not be known.
================================================================================
Question: can facial surgery be done at the same time as a chemical peel?
Baseline Response: yes, the chemical peel is very expensive.
The chemical peel will be applied to the face, and then it will be used to remove the skin from the body.
A chemical peel can also be applied without a skin graft, and even without a facial implant.
For the first time, a chemical-piloted face has been shown to be a very effective cosmetic product.
This is because the chemical-illuminated face can easily be removed from the face by using a chemical skin graft.
However, when a chemical face is removed, the skin can no longer be used for the removal of the skin graft or skin graft graft-free facial implant, which is a very expensive procedure.
In this case, it is important to remember that the skin may not be covered by a skin-pile, so it will not be able to be applied directly to the eyes,

Expected Response: we know that to reduce the risk of poor healing or scarring or skin breakdown that it’s generally not wise to operate meaning do a face lift and slide the skin around and at the same time assault the outer part of the skin with a chemical or a laser. it just is too much for the skin. so the favored approach is to just do the procedures separately usually 3 to 4 months apart. the order often is optional or a matter of choice for the patient chemical first or laser first surgery later or visa versa. don’t do them at the same time because the rule is don’t take chances.

Question: what are the guidelines for using insect repellent on a baby?
Baseline Response: Insect repellents are the most common method of using insecticides on babies. They are very effective in reducing the chance of insect bites and they are also very effective for preventing the development of a skin rash. Insect repelling insect repelling insects are very important to the health of the baby. The most effective method is to use insect repeaters on the baby, and then to use them on the child as a second or third generation insect repeater.

Expected Response: unlike sunscreen which is important to reapply every few hours insect repellent generally should be used just once a day and then washed off before bedtime. check labels for age recommendations. deet is approved for infants over 2 months; oil of lemon eucalyptus is not recommended until at least 3 years. higher concentrations of deet last longer than lower ones (10% deet is effective for 2 hours while 24% is effective for about 5). the american academy of pediatrics recommends that children use deet concentrations below 30%. deet and picaridin tend to last longer than plant oil-based repellents. you can also use netting to physically keep bugs away from your baby. .
================================================================================
Question: could sciatica be caused by a pinched sciatic nerve during a hysterectomy 30 years ago?
Baseline Response: yes, sciatic aneurysms are caused by aneurism. However, they are not caused by the sciatic artery itself. They are caused from the sciasis, the muscle tissue on the sciatics that is contracted and compressed by the artery. The sciatic arteries contract and relax as the blood flows through them. If the sciatus is not contracted properly, the artery will not be able to hold the blood pressure in check. The arteries can contract and tighten as the artery is stretched and contracted. If you have sciatic aorta, the sciascial nerve, called the sciital nerve, is contracted. This nerve is the nerve that is responsible for the pressure in the sciatitis and the pressure of the sciacentia. It is not a muscle nerve. It does not contract, relaxes, and contract.

Expected Response: no the surgical area for a hysterectomy is no where near the sciatic nerve or your spine. in the last 30 years since your surgery you most likely developed some degenerative disc disease and/or arthritis that has lead to your sciatica.

Question: my job said they had health insurance after six months. i've been working there about 2 years and still no insurance. . how do i apply for affordable health insurance? is there a phone number or website?
Baseline Response: no, there is no phone number. We have a website.
Answer 2: i'm at a health care company in the south of the city. i'm asking for health insurance. what do i do?
The first thing i do is contact the doctor to see if there is any insurance for me. If there is, i'll call my insurance company.
If there is not, i ask my insurance agency to provide me with a form.
In this case, my insurance agent provided me with an email address and a phone address.
The next day i was told that i needed to pay a $5.00 fee to get the form. i was able to do that without any problem.
Now that i've received my form,

Question: what could be wrong with my liver? . i went for an ultrasound earlier this week as i have been having symptoms that have progressed for two months (loss of appetite vomiting diarrhea (sometimes bloody) fatigue abdominal pain and cramping). they found two black spots on my liver and are sending me for more testing (an mri). i heard it could be fatty liver disease; but that usually occurs with the obese and people who drink a lot. . im a 16 year old female. 118 pound; 5'5. i live a very healthy lifestyle (exercising and diet
Baseline Response: not sure how much body fat i need to maintain, but i am a beginner and i am overweight. i am not going to tell anyone about my condition, and i think that if i was to do so in the future i would want to know about it.
Answer 1: i am looking for a therapist to help me with my condition. i have a doctor in my area. i

Expected Response: at 16 years of age or at any age waiting for a diagnosis related to liver symptoms is upsetting and scary. liver disorders can strike at any age and even in people who live a clean and healthy life. your doctor should have explained the possible causes of your symptoms as they relate to the black spots. it is not possible to determine the causes of your liver spots until further testing is completed but the possible significance of the spots could have been discussed. with that said please do not listen to well-meaning individuals suggesting a fatty liver as your problem. for the record most people have some degree of fatty liver. here are my two suspicions regarding your case: inflammation responses; non-cancerous and cancerous tumors (please note that it is unusual to have cancer originating in the liver. known as primary liver cancer). i recommend that you receive more information from your doctor surround yourself with the best and most open medical professionals have as many radiologic tests done as possible help to keep the diagnostic testing moving as swiftly as possible to reduce large gaps of time when you are just waiting and thinking talk about your feelings to family and friends and maintain a positive spirit. i wish you well during this period of medical uncertainty.

Question: what causes paget's disease?
Baseline Response: we have a very clear idea that paget is the cause of all forms of disease, from the very beginning of its existence to the present.
However, in order to understand what is going on, we need to understand the causes of the disease. The first is the simple fact that the body is the root of all life and the body of all creatures.
The second is the fact that we can see that the condition of the body has changed from the time when it was created to the time that it is still a living organism.
So, if you look at the body, you will notice that the muscles are made up of three parts: the innermost part (the right-hand part), the outermost part and the outer part.
But, if we look at these three parts of the skeleton, they are actually three different parts of a human body.
In this way, we can understand that the cause

Expected Response: it is not known what causes paget's disease. recently certain genes have been associated with paget's disease including the sequestrosome 1 gene on chromosome 5. virus infection may be necessary to trigger paget's disease in people who have inherited the genetic tendency to develop the condition by having these genes.

Question: i have a pilonidal cyst that is leaking small amounts of pus mixed with blood throughout the day. should i go to the er. i have a pilonidal cyst that is leaking small amounts of pus mixed with blood periodically throughout the day. should i go to the er? . i do not have a family physician i went to a walk in clinic and the physician told me he has referred me to a specialist. that was a week ago and i have not heard word since. if i go to the emergency room at my local hospital will a colorectal surgeon be able to clean out the cyst and remove the hairs? i live in canada so the cost of going to er is not an issue.
Baseline Response: yes, a colovarian specialist is available and there is a free online program to get you a col.

Expected Response: if going to an er is not a financial issue i am sure that you can get care for your pilonidal cyst. there is no way to know if there is a colorectal surgeon waiting around to take care of you however but many er physicians and other primary care medical providers can handle this sort of thing. as you probably know pilonidal cysts do become infected from time to time so perhaps you should consider a more definitive surgical procedure and have the entire cyst removed? no more problems after that surgery!

Question: why do i have bloody drainage from my ear? . i had a brain tumor a few years back and had surgery to remove it. they went in through the ear. i normally have a yellow discharge from it. today it was blood. what could be the cause?
Baseline Response: i had to be in the hospital to have surgery. i had no pain from the surgery. the doctors said it was my ear and they said it would be fixed. i am not sure what the cause is. i did not see a doctor and no one told me.
Answer. i have no idea what the problem is. it is my ear, it is not bleeding. i just did it to get my pain under control and to be able to go to the doctor. i will never know if i am ok or not.
Solution: i have to be on a ventilator. the only way i can go to see the doctor is to go in through a ventilated ventilated

Answer 2: I'm sure you can do this too. i just want to point out how much more of an issue this is.
If you're thinking about this, you should also know that this is not a case of "I just have this problem". this is a case where you need to be able to find the right way to deal with it.
I'm sure there are some people that are good at this, but this is just a general rule.
So how do you deal with stress

Expected Response: different things help for different people. for me when i feel anxious i smell oils like lavender and camomile the smell really helps relax me. if that doesn't work i go for a run or read a book.

Question: what cut of steak is good for entertaining?
Baseline Response: no. But the steak is always better than the steak you're eating. If you want to make a steak, you have to have it cooked. I don't know about you, but it's not a bad steak. It's just a little bit too slow and there's a lot of fat in there. So I would say you get a little more than what you need, but you have no idea what's going on.
So I would also say you're probably better off having it cooked to a very high temperature before eating. That's just what I'm trying to say.
Well, if you want a steak that's good for you, it's better than a steak with a lot more fat in it. But if you're trying to make an amazing steak, what you're going to need is a little less fat in the fat of the steak. And the longer you're cooking the steak, the

Expected Response: have you ever stood before the meat department and wondered what to do? eye of round london broil new york flank filet mignon … they all stand before you and it can be overwhelming. my cousin celia called me today. she was having that “what to do with the meat? ” dilemma. she was getting ready for a friend’s birthday party (this friend loves a great steak) but wasn’t sure which cut to pick for the crowd. if you’re having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon it can be a costly endeavor. my favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is london broil. it is not a fatty cut. the thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so it’s not chewy. when you are starting make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature — do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. if your meat is too cold when you start cooking it it will end up being dried out and chewy. i recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and don’t cook the steak too long (i recommend medium rare to medium at the most). you can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. i also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds slice it thin. this way you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. you still get your boost of protein and iron — and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! you can rub a london broil piece down with cracked pepper kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sautéed garlic. you can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. anyway you prepare it have fun with it and remember to keep your portion size in mind. a good visual for portion size is the size of your fist.

Question: diarrhea and stomach pain. i've been having diarrhea for 6 days. anything i take into my stomach will have to come out within 10-15 min but it will come out only a little at a time and have very bad stomach pain while using the bathroom. i would have to wake up 5-6 times at night to use the bathroom but only little at a time comes out. my stomach seem to hurt more if i lay down and also feeling a lot of back pain. don't have any fever but a little head ahead here and there. is this normal?
Baseline Response: I have diarrhea and nausea and it is not a problem. I would call it a "dietary issue" as the stomach is not quite as normal as it is when I take it. I usually have a few days of diarrhea at night and I do not have the stomach pain or stomach pain that I used to have.
Answer 1: I think it is normal to have diarrhea. It is

Expected Response: viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year. please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since i have no way of examining you. the most important thing is fluid replacement. you must stay well-hydrated. don't eat very much for a few more days. most of these viral infections resolve in about 7-10 days so hang in there. at least you are not vomiting so be greatful. in my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas. your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined.
================================================================================
Question: what can i do to treat gallstones at home?
Baseline Response: I am a physician and I have to treat patients in my practice and I can't do that at home. I think the best way to do that is to use a medicine called laminar hydrolase which is the enzyme that converts glucose into the gallium. The enzyme is the one that is important in treating gallstones. You can use a tablet to take one pill of laminal hydrolate and one pill to take two pills of lard. That will give you a treatment that will last for about 30 days. If you don't have a medication, you can take a tablet and get it for about 10 days. Then you can get it at home and take it home.

Expected Response: there is no specific home treatment for gallstones but be sure to call your doctor if: you think you have symptoms that may be caused by gallstones. if your doctor finds that you do have gallstones but your symptoms are mild it is generally safe to wait until you have more than one attack before you consider having surgery. you develop symptoms of a gallstone attack again especially if they are severe or occur with fever chills or yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes. you have new belly pain or other belly symptoms. pain in the belly can be a symptom of many health problems. you may be able to help prevent gallstones if: you stay close to a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. you avoid rapid weight loss. intentional weight loss (dieting as opposed to weight loss from illness) followed by weight gain may increase your risk of gallstones especially if you are a woman. if you need to lose weight do so slowly and sensibly. if you have recently had surgery to remove your gallbladder : watch for signs of infection. call your doctor if the area around the incision is red and puffy or if you have a fever. call your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) light-colored stools and dark urine. these symptoms may be signs that gallstones are blocking the common bile duct. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what does high mid percentage in blood mean
Baseline Response: high mid-point means that you're more likely to have high blood in your blood. You're more than twice as likely to be high mid point than low point. High mid-points are the lowest point in your body that you can reach for.
What is a high midpoint?
High mid- points are the highest point in the body that is higher than the midpoint of your blood supply.
The difference between a low mid point and high mid range is that if you are in a high-point state, you're about to lose a lot of blood. If you're in a low-point or mid-range state, your blood is going to be at its lowest point. If your blood goes down, you are going to have a lot more blood in the blood stream.
So, the idea is that when you're getting into a high point, you have the opportunity to lose more blood,

Expected Response: your question in its present form is unanswerable. there is really no such thing as "high mid percentage" so you will need to go back to your medical provider for some more information about your blood test. sorry.

Answer 1: the pain is not what it was before you started your pregnancy. it was more like a burning sensation on the back of your neck, then gradually increasing in intensity. it's not as painful as it used to be, and I can't say that it is the same after you start your pregnancy, but it still feels very good.

Expected Response: i am not a vet but i do have 3 dogs and 3 cats so i have a lot of personal experience with pets. i would be concerned about the dog dragging his back legs. that is not something that would generally be caused by the routine causes of diarrhea. i am pretty confident any veterinarian would suggest the dog needs to be seen probably sooner than later. that is not something that over the counter meds would be able to treat. how do i treat occasional diarrhea in my dog

Question: what conditions does lactose intolerance treat?
Baseline Response: a lactose intolerant person who is trying to get their body to adapt to lactose will experience a loss of muscle mass. This loss will be accompanied by loss of the ability to tolerate the lactose.
What is the risk of a lactase reaction?
What are the symptoms of a type of lactase?
How does a lactate reaction affect my health?
Which medications can be taken?
Is my blood lactate free?
Are my blood glucose levels normal?
If so, what are the risks of a reaction? The risk of an allergic reaction to lactase can be very high.
Is there any risk of developing a lactitis reaction? What is the right dose?
Can I get more than 1.5 times the amount of lactose in my body?
Does lactose affect my mood or affect my overall health? How can I find out if my blood sugar levels are normal

Expected Response: this product is an enzyme supplement used to help people who have trouble digesting milk and other dairy products (lactose intolerance). lactose is a type of sugar found in milk products. lactase enzyme is normally produced by the body to help break down (digest) lactose. lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces low amounts of lactase enzyme. lactose intolerance can begin at different ages. infants are not usually affected but lactose intolerance can affect children as young as 2. it is very common in adults. one way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid milk products. however this can result in a lack of important nutrients and vitamins such as calcium vitamin d riboflavin and protein. some people use lactose-free milk or milk substitutes such as soy or rice milk. most people with low lactase enzyme levels can tolerate small amounts of milk products at one time (2-4 ounces) and get symptoms only with larger servings (6 ounces or more). taking lactase enzyme with milk products as directed can help prevent upset stomach abdominal bloating/cramping gas and diarrhea caused by these products. the fda has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness. consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.

Baseline Response: i've been taking this and a friend of mine (my wife) has been taking it for a couple of years. i'm very pleased with how it's working. I'm not taking it because i don't feel like it's a good thing. I don't think it's really a problem. I've been using it for about a year now and it seems to work fine. I do feel that it has some side effects and that it's not a drug that's a "drug" but it does have side effects. The only problem I see with this is that there is no way to tell if you're taking an adderal or a methamphetamine. I think it would be better to just not take it. I also think that the dosage would be too high. I like the fact that it works so well for

Expected Response: yes. adderall contains amphetamines and will test positive on a drug test. you should bring your prescription or a doctor’s note with you to the test to verify that you are using adderall for medical reasons.

Question: i am a man taking minoxidil. is there any danger for my pregnant wife (and future baby) through ejaculating inside her?
Baseline Response: Yes, it is. You will have to be careful with the dose, but if your pregnant wife is concerned about the risks, you can take the dosage to prevent pregnancy.
I have used minoximide for years, and i know the benefits. The dosage is about 3 mg/day for the first few weeks and 3 mg for the second few weeks. The dose is about 50 mg/min and 1 mg/hour for the rest of the month.
For women with pre-pubertal diabetes, the dose for the 2 weeks is about 1 mg for 1 week. For women with a non-diabetic diet, the dosage is 2 mg/week for 1 month and 2 mg for 2 months.
The dose for a woman who is using minoxifen is about 200 mg/d.

Expected Response: hi i found you this on the uk's nhs. family planning and pregnancy most medicines in some way can affect the development of a baby in the womb. the effect on the baby differs between medicines and also depends on the stage of pregnancy that you have reached when you take the medicine. in the case of minoxidil: the use of this medicine during pregnancy is not recommended. if you could become pregnant you must use effective contraception or abstain from penetrative sex. you must contact your prescriber if you become pregnant or think you have become pregnant while taking minoxidil if you take this medicine during your pregnancy your baby may have some problems after birth you should discuss your personal circumstances with your doctor if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant. this is so that together you can make a decision about what treatment you may need during your pregnancy. you should discuss whether there are any other medicines which you could take during pregnancy which would treat your condition. do hope its the info your looking for. good luck

Question: is hand foot mouth disease the same as thrush. is hand foot and mouth disease caused by the same virus as thrush? would l-lysine help this condition? .
Baseline Response: l-l-lysines are the same type of virus as l-leukine, but are the two viruses different? the difference between l-lynsine and l-lesin is a little too great for me.
Answer : l-Lynsine is not a virus. the same viruses as lysine are.

Expected Response: no. they are not the same. hand foot and mouth disease is caused by a coxsackie virus. thrush is caused by yeast. l-lysine would be worthless in treating either one. hand foot and mouth disease will self-resolve and does not require treatment. thrush may also self-resolve but there are prescription anti-yeast medications that really help make it go away sooner.

Question: sprained my ankle 2 months ago. bone chip and 2 fibular fractures. it still hurts on outside of my arch. why? . 2 months ago i rolled my ankle. i severely sprained it and had two small fractures and a bone chip on the fibular bone. i was in a boot for 2 weeks and then an air cast. my foot still hurts especially on the outside edge of the arch. it also hurts on the top of my foot when i lace up my shoes. i am finding myself limping yet? what else could be wrong with my foot and what to do about it?
Baseline Response: I am a self healing person. I need to heal my ankle and bone chip but also my foot. I have tried to heal it and have found it to be much better. My ankle is pretty good now. I am going to try and keep it healthy as long as I can.
Answer 1: my ankle is broken. I did a whole year of

Expected Response: you need to see an orthopedist or podiatrist for a higher level exam; perhaps an mri of you ankle to see the ligaments and soft tissue. x-rays only show bone and based on the extent of your injuries there could easily be other problems that have not been detected.

Question: what over-the-counter (otc) medication is ok to take for headaches when you have stomach ulcers?
Baseline Response: Over the counter (otcs) medication may cause the symptoms of over-eating and over-fishing. Some people may be able to tolerate over-treating their stomach ulcer without having to take any over- the-counter medications.
I have heard the following from people who have had over-eaten stomach ulcs for over a year.
They have been given over-diet and over the counter medications, which have caused them to have over- eating.
My doctor said "over-dipping is bad, you have to eat and drink".
I said "oh well, I can do that".
He said "okay, we can have you over-drinking but you have no stomach ulction".
This is what they said.
This was true for a while.
However, over-

Expected Response: this is a popular question that i get a lot at the pharmacy. for a headache you can take tylenol or acetaminophen. this medication is safe to take if you have stomach ulcers. you want to make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the package and if you have any questions talk to your pharmacist -- we will be happy to answer questions like this.

Question: what would make my tsh levels suddenly jump to critically high level when i feel the same? . i take synthroid 1. 25 daily and yet my tsh is now 28. 3 increased from 23. on friday. why would it jump so quickly? my dr. is on vacation and i just want to make sure this is ok to wait until thursday when he comes back. .
Baseline Response: what makes my tsl levels suddenly rise so fast is the fact that i don't have the time to play any of the songs that are on the album. I feel like I'm just playing more and more of them, and it's not like I have a problem playing them all the time. it's like i'm playing something I'm already playing. it might not be the most enjoyable song on the whole album, but it's definitely fun to play. i am pretty sure that I'm playing a lot of songs on this album that i would love to play more

Expected Response: i'm wondering why you would have your tsh tested twice so close together. usually with hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) it takes weeks of medication therapy to see any change in tsh levels so it doesn't make sense to me your doctor would have you tested just a few days apart. that said while a tsh value of 28 is high it should be fine to wait until thursday to see your doctor. as to why your tsh seems to be going up without you experiencing symptoms well many things can cause this. your doctor will be able to give you some possible reasons for this and (hopefully) get you on a path to better control. best wishes to you! staying at the wrong dosage amount for too long and fluctuate your levels and cause them to change and go from under to over.

Question: does drinking too much water and soda before a meal make you feel full that you do not want to eat? . my sons girlfriend allows her children to drink a lot of water and soda right before they eat and then they do not eat. doesn't drinking a lot before a meal fill you up and then you are not hungry?
Baseline Response: The answer to this question is yes, it does. The first time you eat, you are more likely to feel full and not hungry. You may feel full when you eat and you may feel hungry when you drink, but you may also feel thirsty when you do drink. As you can see, drinking too many drinks and drinking too little can make you thirsty. The drinking that you can do during the meal may be a result of a number of factors, but they are not necessarily the cause of your thirst.
What does this mean for your kids?
A. Drinking too much is a bad idea.
B. Drinking is not

Expected Response: yes drinking fluids especially sugar-sweetened or calorie-containing beverages can cause feelings of fullness resulting in decreased food intake. young children with small stomachs are more likely to fill up than older children and adults. it's best to serve calorie-containing beverages with meals. for example juice and milk with lunch or dinner and soda only occasionally. water is the best in between meal beverage. good luck!

Question: can you use beast milk on a diaper rash. she has a bad rash all over.
Baseline Response: yes
Answer 1:
Answer 2:

Expected Response: interestingly yes you can use breast milk for diaper rash. although i'm not aware of any studies that prove it works many women claim it does. it certainly can't hurt to try. my concern is when you say the rash is "all over. " i hope you mean "all over" the baby's bottom. if your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment. with diaper rash prevention is better than treatment. remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments. it's very important that you thoroughly clean and dry your baby's genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change. and never leave your baby "soaking" in wet diapers. change the diapers regularly. instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isn't having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes. wishing you and your baby well!

Question: what could cause hair loss and nails cracking?
Baseline Response: the cause of hair loss is hair loss caused by the presence of high levels of testosterone in the blood. This is what causes hair loss. The testosterone is the hormone that is responsible for hair growth. The body needs testosterone to grow and produce hair. As a result, hair growth slows down.
How do I know if I have hair loss?
There are a number of things that can cause hair to crack. The first thing to consider is the amount of testosterone that you have in your blood. If you have a low testosterone level, your hair will be less elastic. If your hair is extremely thin, you will have less hair growth because your body will be more efficient at growing and producing hair. The more testosterone you have, the more hair will grow.
What happens to my hair when I have high levels?
When you have high testosterone levels, your skin will become soft. This softness causes your hair

Expected Response: hi hair loss could be down to bc pills a good place to start with. as for your nails sounds very much like the need to be strengthened up for this you need gelatine simple way for this to get into your super market and by the blocks of jelly for making jellies you eat just a couple of squares a day as your find these blocks should be divided into 12. ok good luck

Question: how is the hepatitis b virus spread (transmitted)?
Baseline Response: The hepatitis b viruses have been reported to infect people in the US. It is the same as the hepatitis A virus.

Expected Response: hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.

Question: can a yeast infection cause pain in the urethra as well as the head of the penis? . originially thought to have prostatitis a month ago have been experiencing penis soreness urethra pain some redness. gonnohrea and chlamydia negative and 3 weeks of cipro provided no relief. now thinking it may be fungal. could this be a yeast infection and if not what could it be?
Baseline Response: it is possible that these three things could be the cause of the soreness. The most likely reason is that the yeast is able to break down the chlamydial membrane that is present in the penis and the vas deferens (the blood vessels in the vagina). the vas is also part of the vasculature. the vagina is the major organ of the body and is also responsible for the sexual pleasure of the male. if the vas and blood vessels are broken down and the penis is not able to contract they may cause

Expected Response: yes it could be fungal. depending of what direction you have more confidence in get candida treatment like fluconazole and if you are circumsized use the creams like canesten. if you are not circumsized i would not recommend the creams as they shrink the foreskin and you will feel like a little boy again. ( but then the foreskin cracks and that really is painfull and impossible to keep clean) if you go for the more natural approach gentle soaking and washing with a mild sollution of nice quality applecider- vinegar will work like a miracle cure.

Baseline Response: if you are a 28-year old woman and have a heart condition and are suffering from a heart disease and have experienced some of the things mentioned above then you can help me to understand what alka is.
What is alka?
It is a drug that is used in the treatment of heart problems. The drug is called alka (pronounced "alek"). alka has no side effects and is usually taken in a very small dose. However, if you have a problem with

Expected Response: it sounds like you are having symptoms of gerd (or acid reflux disease) with your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is highly unlikely you are having a heart attack. if you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into gerd. i have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with gerd. i find taking an extra strength zantac (150 mg) once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms. if that doesn't help or doesn't help enough you can always speak to your doctor. there are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better. (proton inhibitors slow the production of stomach acid) however if you are having any other symptoms or your current ones get worse i would definitely contact your doctor right away.

Question: are both pneumococcal vaccines safe?
Baseline Response: yes, both are safe.
Mumps vaccine is an extremely rare, highly contagious, and highly contagious disease.
The first, most common, and most contagious, causes of illness are pneumonia, fever, and sore throat. Mumps vaccine can also cause pneumonia, as well as other respiratory illnesses. It is the most common cause of pneumonia, and it is also the most contagious.
Both pneumococcus and Mumps are very common, especially in children, and are very rare, but they are very contagious. They are also very contagious to anyone with a history of having a history with pneumonia.
If you have a history or history of a history that is severe, or if you have had a history in the past, or you have been in a position to have a severe history with a severe illness, you are at risk of developing pneumonia, because it is very rare.
When you get a serious illness with

Question: how can we treat our 6 month old who has nasal congestion that only seems to bother him at night?
Baseline Response: it's an issue of airway congestion.
You will hear about it, but the issue is that it's a really common problem in many parts of the country.
It's a problem that's very, very hard to fix.
The issue is, it's very difficult to treat.
This is a problem we have to solve.
If we can't treat this issue, we can only treat this problem.
Now, we're going to address this problem as soon as we can.
We'll go through some of the things we do to address it.
I'm going to go through a couple of the issues.
1. We have to fix the nasal congestion problem. We're going over some of that.
2. We need to fix it. We've been talking about that for a long time.
What we're

Expected Response: my favorite is using nasal saline drops (with or without the suctioning). the saline helps to loosen up the mucus and promote drainage and the saline also helps to shrink down the nasal passageways -- allowing for more air passage. since it is just salt water you can use it as often as you like and it is pretty inexpensive. .

Question: how to shop for glasses. what is the most important thing to "look" for when shopping for glasses? . what are the various materials used in "glasses"? . does frame design/material affect vision or is it merely a cosmetic thing? . do higher priced lens mean better lens? . how many pair of glasses should the average person have? . how do eye examinations differ from a shop front shop to an md? . at what age do our eyes undergo the greatest changes? . how often should a person expecially the elderly have a full eye examination?
Baseline Response: glasses are the most expensive and most important part of a customer's life. The amount of time and effort it takes to get the right eye for a given customer is the main factor. The more time a person spends looking at glasses the more important it is for them to have a better eye. This is why the glasses are so important.
Do you know if you should buy glasses or not?

Question: my dad had his bladder removed due to cancer. has a urostomy. now after 4 years he has blood from his penis and pain. he is not sexually active nor masturbates". no trauma or injury. just pain and a slow oozing of bright red blood. no other symptoms or changes with his urostomy. he does have a large abdominal hernia from the bladder removal surgery done in 2008. cancer?
Baseline Response: no. no evidence of cancer or any other medical conditions. no cancer at all. no signs of prostate cancer. no medical or medical history of prostate surgery. no blood tests to test for prostate cancer (if needed). no history of bleeding, swelling, or bleeding from any of the above causes. no pain. no symptoms. no history. no bleeding. no problems. no side effects. no one has any health problems or any problems with his or her bladder. he or she can still function normally but may have some issues with his bladder.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear your dad is going through this. it sounds frightening. i would not jump to an immediate diagnosis of cancer. while this unexpected bleeding certainly should be investigated by a health care professional there could be many causes for this bleeding that have nothing to do with cancer. that said i would suggest your dad see a health care provider as soon as possible. any time a person develops a new symptom (such as bleeding) it's worth getting it checked out. hope this helps. wishing your dad all the best!

Question: i will retire this year at 62. my income will drop from $60 000 a year to $22 000. my current employer offers a health insurance plan similar to the silver plan for $150/month. can i save money by opting out of the employer plan and opting into the aca plan? what are my options? also is there a maximum out-of-pocket amount for the aca plans?
Baseline Response: my current insurance plan does not cover the cost of my Medicare prescription drugs or I will need to pay the cost to pay for my prescription drugs. i have a policy that covers my prescription drug costs but i cannot afford to pay my prescription costs for the ACA plan. i am not able to afford to save money to pay back my prescription cost. i will continue to save for my ACA prescription costs.
Answer 1: i am looking for a better healthcare plan, but i am currently in a bad situation. i can no longer afford to buy insurance

Expected Response: while you're still working you won't qualify for a tax credit if the employer's plan is considered affordable under the law. affordable employer health insurance costs no more than 9. 5% of your income and covers at least 60% of covered medical costs. health plans must now limit your annual out-of-pocket costs to $6 350 for an individual and $12 700 for a family. once you retire and are no longer an active employee you can buy a plan through the marketplace. depending on your income you may qualify for a tax credit to buy insurance through the marketplace.

Question: i quit smoking 11 days ago. i smoked 10-12 a day. will the continine show up in my blood test when i go for it?
Baseline Response: I quit smoking when i quit using the standard oral contraceptive pill. It works fine. I had to stop using it at least 3 months ago and will definitely use it again. I have never had any side effects from it.
Answer. I did quit smoking on my own for a few months and was able to continue using it. However, the main side effect was the withdrawal of my body from the pill. I didn't realize until 3 months later that I was taking the pill with a very small dose of the oral contraceptive.
I did try to take the pill and it stopped working. I am now trying to get it back on again and will try to get the same result.

Expected Response: normal since you were a light smoker. it takes approx. 2 weeks for it not to show up in blood work. i would say your safe for it not showing up.

Question: so i have this hard lump in my breast and i'm not sure what it could be? . it's only in my right breast and it's been there for about 6 months and it's lumpy when i raise my arms up you can tell the difference in shape from my left breast i squeezed my right breast the other night and had some clear brownish fluid come out but nothing since then and my nipples itch like crazy i'm 24 years old i found out very aggressive breast and ovarian cancer runs in his family and the woman very rarely make it through the cancer i don't think it's cancer can some one help?
Baseline Response: this is an issue for me. I have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It's been a while since I've had any symptoms. I'm not a big fan of surgery, but I'm very happy with it. I am really happy to have my body back to health and to be able to have a normal life and to have this natural breast

Expected Response: i can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump. you will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies. many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindly. you must have a proper examination.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe to take benadryl and aleve together?
Baseline Response: It is not safe to do so.
The other reason is that it is a little too spicy, so you will have to eat a little more and you will be more sensitive to it.
It is very important to note that it does not affect your mood or your body.
And if you are going to use this method, it is important to take care of your hair, and if you do not take care and do not put on a proper bra, you will probably end up with a bad look.
How to use it?
The best way to use benadron is to take a lot of benadrizin (B.B.G.), and then make it as pure as possible.
I used a little bit of aloe vera, but I don't use it that much anymore.
When I first started to use aloe, I made it so

Expected Response: benadryl is a nonprescription medication that is often used for allergies and aleve is a nonprescription pain reliever. one of the most common side effects of benadryl is drowsiness. depending on the quantity taken aleve may also cause some drowsiness. but there are no interactions between these two medications and they are completely safe to take together.

Expected Response: post partum depression like other forms of major depression may last for months or even years if untreated. it is not your fault. eighteen months is too long to have endured those feelings of sadness. certainly with a husband working long hours and not being in an area with close friends and family can also contribute to depression. only a mental health professional trained in depressive disorders can properly diagnosis whether you are experiencing ppd some other form of depression or a combination of these maladies. you may also have a medical condition that results in causing depression as a symptom. i respectively make the following suggestions: 1. ) talk with your husband about your sadness. if he is not approachable then seek the counsel of your physician (this individual can conduct medical testing as well as assess your overall mental state prescribe medication and make mental health referrals) or a minister / priest /rabbi. they can act as a sounding board to express your feelings and offer positive suggestions on restoring joy in your life. 2. ) consider joining a self-help group to support your efforts at regaining purpose in your life. you deserve to feel worthy to have friendships and to feel and give love. through talk therapy and medications the prognosis is encouraging.

Question: how to gain weight back from unexpected weight loss also having fatigue and nausea? . i have had an ongoing anxiety disorder for 3 years. i've finall found a med combination that works for me. venlafaxline and bupropion. i had been on the bupropion for about a year before so one drug was new. before i started this drug i started having unexplained naused food eversions and lots of fatigue i have dropped my weight from 105 to 91 pounds. am a personal trainer just trying to put on muscle but nothing is helping! i feel like im constantly forcing myself to eat. hcg= neg tsh= normal
Baseline Response: i have been on a med for 2 years now and the one i was on was bupropions. I have been working on my weight loss and eating a lot of different foods. i have used bupropons for weight loss for the last 2 years and i'm still in a state of depression. this medication

Expected Response: the key is to get the cause of the weight loss under control which it sounds like have started to do. as for weight gain you need to make food and eating a priority. frequent meals (5-<positive_smiley> may work better especially if you still having nausea. take advantage of the times your appetite is high which for most people with nausea is in the first half of the day. provide yourself with as many food groups as possible when you do eat-- grains protein dairy (or alternative) healthy fats and fruits and vegetables. so instead of just cereal in the morning top it with nuts and fruit and also have a boiled egg. at snack time have full fat yogurt with nuts and graham crackers. make sure you up the fat where you can such as adding a fat source to sandwiches like sliced avocado mayonnaise nut butters or hummus. add full fat dairy products to smoothies and soups and butter or nut butters to toast. protein sources are beneficial such as meats tuna (packed in oil) and beans. with time and vigilance you can get your weight back up. for more tips on healthy ways to gain weight see this webmd article. good luck!

Question: i had a dtap in 2011 and i stepped on a nail today. do i need to get a tetanus shot? . im 16
Baseline Response: i just want to tell you that i was 14 years old when i got the tetanus shots. i was not sick. i have no idea what to do with my life anymore. i did not know how to do anything. i dont know how i would live without my tetanus and my life would be completely different. i do not know if i can live without it or not. i am scared of how much i will lose. i will not let go of my life. i need help. i hope that this helps.
Answer 1: i am sorry but i am not going to get any help. you can go to your local drugstore and buy your first shot. you will get no help from your doctor. you just have to go to the doctor. i can tell you how you will feel after that.

Expected Response: the good news is: probably not. the dtap vaccine (which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis) is considered protective for 10 years. we recommend everyone get re-vaccinated with dtap every decade. that said the only way to tell for sure you're protected (because not all vaccines "take" the way they're supposed to) is to look at your blood antibodies. if your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then you're golden. bottom line: your best bet is to consult a health care provider. even if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems. better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary. hope this helps!

Question: i had a reaction to one of the lipsticks i was using. my lips are very sore and have a burning sensation. what to use. i had some kind of reaction on my lips to one of the glosses or lipsticks i was using. my lips are very sore and when i try to apply lipstick they really burn. i think they are irritated. what can i use on them so they will get better. i keep using the medex for lips which usually helps but am having a hard time getting them cleared up. help i am desperate. hate going without lipstick.
Baseline Response: i have had some people tell me they have a reaction that is too severe for them to use and they want to use a different one. but i think it is best to use the gloss that is best for them. i have a hard day. what do i do?
Answer, i have been trying to use this lipstick for a while. it works fine, it does not seem

Expected Response: if i were you i'd probably break open a vitamin e capsule rub it on my lips before bed and let it soak in overnight. that does amazing things for healing. sometimes medicated lip balms can be a real problem especially if your lips are already irritated. but vitamin e oil does wonders for delicate skin like that.

Question: how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?
Baseline Response: by making it easier for consumers to make informed decisions about which products they buy.
The recommendations are not perfect, but they help to ensure that consumers are informed about the health risks of their new products.
It is important to note that many of these recommendations are based on a study of the health effects of oral contraceptive pills.
Some of these are based upon the fact that many women are unaware that they are taking oral contraceptives.
How can I help?
We need your help to get the recommendations out there that are helping patients make informed choices about their new pap smeared products. If you are having trouble with the new advice and you would like to help us out, please reach out to us via our contact form. We will be happy to help.
If you have any questions, please contact us by phone at (209) 541-2223 or by email at contact@pharm

Expected Response: the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear.

Question: my doctor asks me to get a tetanus vaccine upon an injury when i am doubtful of acquiring tetanus. . is this anti-tetanus vaccine? if so for how long do these vaccines are effective? some say it for three months or for six months. is it okay if one gets this vaccine before twenty-four hours of injury?
Baseline Response: no, no, you are not allowed to get this vaccine during your injury.
Answer #2: This is a non-toxic vaccine.

Expected Response: the tetanus vaccine is good for ten years but some medical providers will recommend a booster vaccine sooner than that if there is some doubt as to the previous date or if the wound is particularly prone. the disease tetanus is very rare in the united states (not so rare in other countries) but if you should get it it has an extremely high fatality rate. getting a vaccine every ten years for 100% protection is really the best deal out there in the vaccine world. getting the vaccine 24 hours before a planned injury (? ) is unlikely to be very effective unless of course you have prior immunity from a previous tetanus still on board.

http.philly.com/_news/local/article-1117086/why-meth-can-lower-bone/
My doctor says that he can't tell you which treatment options will work for you and that he will be doing it for

Expected Response: a fracture of the spine whether from osteoporosis trauma or cancer is basically a broken bone. the usual treatment for a broken bone is to stabilize it. a broken vertebral body can be stabilized either by a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure such as a vertebroplasty kyphoplasty or by open surgical procedures. an older technique now rarely used is to remove or sever the nerves supplying the bone; these nerves are called the gray rami communicans. finally various medications for pain can be used. these would include the full range of pain medications including over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen aspirin and the various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and various prescription medications including hydrocodone morphine preparations and the fentanyl patch.

Question: we are having some weight gain and growth issues with our 17 month old. my daughter stella is 17 months old. she is only 18 lbs and not growing well. she is in the "less than 2nd %" on both height and weight. we have been to several doctors and have had several tests done and luckily everything has come back fine. stella loves to eat! she can eat a kids meal and 10 minutes later be asking for a snack. with all the food she eats she should be an obese baby. she is doing great developmentally. anyone with some advice on other tests please let me know.
Baseline Response: the stella test is a good test to see if you are developing any problems with your baby's weight. If it doesn't show up on the test, you have a potential for a heart attack. If the test shows no signs of heart disease or any other problems, you may be on to something.
Response: if your stella shows

Expected Response: the key for growth at this age is looking at her growth over time. has her growth been steady since birth but at lower percentiles or has it dropped recently? red flags for growth are when they cross 2 percentile lines either up or down. also doctors should be using the world health organization growth charts for children under 2. if you pediatrician is using the cdc ones it could give you daughter a lower reading. lastly i highly recommend seeing a pediatric dietitian. he/she can assess what/when/how your child is eating and provide recommendations. typical reasons for groth issues include difficulty transitioning to solid food excessive juice/milk stressful feeding and a low fat/low calorie diet. children under 2 need more fat so that is an important consideration when deciding what foods to offer. also timing and feeding interactions can make a big difference in how well a child eats. you can get a referral through your doctor to a outpatient program at a children's hospital or find a dietitian that specializes in pediatrics by visiting eatright. org. once you get some answers you can rest easy knowing you are doing all you can do.

Question: what are the complications of orthostatic hypotension?
Baseline Response: hypotension is a physical condition in which a person's body is not functioning properly. It can be a severe case of heart failure, a heart attack, or a stroke.
The heart does not respond to drugs and other medications. The heart is in the system and is not in a state of active activity.
Some people may have a low level of blood sugar, which can cause heart problems. This means that you need to take insulin and other drugs to help your heart work properly.
If your heart is not working properly, you may have anemia, anemia or a low blood pressure. This can occur when your body is over-exposed to glucose, and this can cause problems like hyperglycemia.
There is also a risk of heart disease, especially if you are overweight or obese.
People with orthostasis are more likely to have heart attacks, strokes, heart attacks and

Expected Response: falling is the most important complication of orthostatic hypotension. most often the symptoms are transient and self-limiting giving the patient a chance to sit down but when the drop in blood pressure causes syncope (fainting) or near syncope it is the trauma that is sustained in the fall that causes the most damage.

Question: is expired liquid prednisone safe to use?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 1: Is there any difference between the two?
A: Yes, the only difference is that some of the drugs used for the treatment of acne are prednisolone.
A few of the other drugs used to treat acne are:
Aromatherapy
Aquaridone
Aldosterone
Aquinacrine
Cetylhydrazine
Cyclopentasiloxane
Cytolysis

Gutinized Methadone
Ganopsychotics
Gibenzolam
Guaracil
Gramadol
Haloperidol
Hydrocodone
Hydromorphone
Iodine
Lithium-90
Leprosylone
Methad

Expected Response: in general it's not a good idea to take expired medications of any kind. doing so could possibly make you sick and an equally important issue is that the medication may no longer be effective. what's the use of taking a medicine that has lost its potency? if you have any questions about this you can contact your pharmacist. he or she will be happy to help you. best to you!

Baseline Response: I've tried Difluxin. It is a good probiotic and will help with my vaginal opening and opening. but not on my cervix. itchy vagina and opening is the problem. i have had my cervicle dry and not the cervix and i am so happy that i am able to have it. i'm not sure if the problem is my cervicose

Expected Response: hi could be just a thing with you perhaps an imbalance that's why the ph soap works but try shaving if you don't get rid of those beastie hairs would be a good start just in case you don't shave try washing twice a day with sea salt water in a hand basin use just a desert spoonful see how you get on. as this has been going on for so long a drastic way would be just before going to bed cut a garlic clove in half and smear this round the inside of the folds be warned it may smart for a bit then go off you may even taste garlic in your mouth its the way it works through your body. this is just an idea from things for yeast infection and bv that like yours wont go away but they do with either of these. do hope it helps in some way. good luck

Question: my daughter had a dental cleaning. now she has a large bubble on her gum above one of the teeth. what should i do?
Baseline Response: She should be able to walk.
Answer 1: I believe that dental cleaning is an important part of a healthy life.
I will go through the dental cleaning process as I go along and I will try to make sure that the tooth is clean.
For more information on this, please read this article:
My daughter had an oral cleaning.
This is an excellent post on the topic. I would like to thank you for the helpful comments.
Thanks for your help. I have done my best to make this a successful post. I am a good listener. I hope that you are too.

Expected Response: the bubble can mean that there is an abscessed or infected nerve gum or foreign object inside the cavity. the child needs to be seen by a dentist immediately. antibiotics or a baby root canal are possible treatments for the problem.

Question: what are "onlays" and "3/4 crowns"?
Baseline Response: 3/4 is for the first crowns and 1/4 for the second crowns. The first crown is the standard, and the second one is the "incomplete crown". The 4 crowns are the standard crown, and you can use the "1/4" or "1.5" to specify the "standard" and complete crowns, respectively.
Answer 1: If you want to keep your crowns as "on" as possible, you need to change the size of the crown to fit your needs. I've seen that in a few cases, the size is too small, and it's difficult to keep it in.
1:5 crowns = 1.5 crown
1.25 crowns= 1.25
1/2 crowns/3 crowns is the perfect size for the "on".
2:3 crown = 2.

Expected Response: onlys and 3/4 crowns are variations on the technique of dental crowns. the difference between these crowns and the crowns discussed previously is their coverage of the underlying tooth. the "traditional" crown covers the entire tooth; onlays and 3/4 crowns cover the underlying tooth to a lesser extent.

Question: i had a normal period about a week after intercourse then another a month later than 2 months later spotting. problem? . i'm also feeling slightly nauseas. i haven't been sexually active after the first incident however. i am mainly wondering what could've caused the spotting and if by seeing that i've stressed myself into making up the nausea and thinking it's worse than it really is.
Baseline Response: I was experiencing symptoms of a condition called "bipolar depression". I'm not sure what this means. I am not sure if I'm experiencing this condition or if I am simply having a bad day. I don't know.
I'm not the only one who is experiencing this, and it's probably not because of my mood swings. It's probably because of the fact that I'm doing things that I think I'm really not doing. I've been on antidepressants for about a year now, and I'm still on them, but I'm going to stop them for a

Expected Response: most helpful answer if you had unprotected sex it would be good to still take a pregnancy test. some women still have periods or bleeding after getting pregnant. if you are not pregnant check with you doctor on what could be causing your spotting. anything that's not normal for you should be checked out.

Question: what is hypothyroidism?
Baseline Response: hypothyronism is the condition that causes an imbalance of thyroid hormones and hormones that are not present in the body. Hypothyroidist is the name given to a condition that is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone. Hypotrytopenia is characterized by excessive thyroid hormone production and low levels of thyroid stimulating hormone. The condition is caused when the thyroid is damaged, or if the thyroid gland is damaged in a way that causes the body to produce too much thyroid hormone to control its production.
Hypothyroid is a disorder in which a person develops a hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroid) with normal thyroid function. It is a condition in which the body is not able to control the thyroid hormone levels necessary to keep the body functioning normally.
What is hypogonadism? It is the abnormality in the thyroid that causes a deficiency in thyroid hormone that causes excessive thyroid hormones to be produced. It can

Expected Response: hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by abnormally low thyroid hormone production. there are many disorders that result in hypothyroidism. these disorders may directly or indirectly involve the thyroid gland. because thyroid hormones affect growth development and many cellular processes inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body.

Question: what are the best antioxidants to use? what products are the best for an antiaging regimen?
Baseline Response: An antioxidant is a substance that is present in the body that protects cells from damage or damage to their DNA or DNA repair products. In a normal human diet, an antioxidant is found in the form of antioxidants such as vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin K. Vitamin A is found mainly in the red blood cells of the brain, which are important in the development of the nervous system. The vitamin A found in a normal diet is found to protect the cells from the damage caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin K is found mostly in the liver, and is also found in small amounts in the brain.
In humans, an individual's vitamin A is the amount of vitamin A that is found naturally in the blood. In fact, there is a large amount of this vitamin in the human body. In the form that we consume, we are consuming a lot of vitamin K,

Question: can being in severe pain cause sugar glucose levels to rise to higher than normal levels? . my husband was in pain from a nail stabbing him in the foot a couple of weeks ago. his sugar was checked and found it to be unusually high at 402. he is a type 2 diabetic and we have never seen his sugar this high before and he had been taking his medicine when he was supposed to. he was given a shot of incillin to bring his sugar back down.
Baseline Response: can sugar be added to food and drink to make it easier to drink, more healthy and less sugar is required to make them, but can it be added during the day or during the night?

Question: currently taking 75mg of paxil for anxiety. noticing it is not working as well as before. what should i add to it? . i have been on 75mg of paxil cr for three years for treating my panic attacks and general anxiety. it has worked very well. about three weeks ago i started noticing some anxiety creeping back in and i know i'm maxed out on the paxil. should i ask my doctor about adding something like abilify or some other drug to help boost me back to where i was? or should i seek a different ssri altogether? i'm nervous about the latter simply because the paxil has worked so well for so long. thanks!
Baseline Response: currently no one has ever been able to completely treat my anxiety. It is not something that should be done for every day. It can be done with any kind of medication, but it can't be done on a daily basis. I have to try something and if

Expected Response: you are correct in suspecting that the paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions. many of the ssri's including zoloft and prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement. after several years of reliable benefit these ssri's may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms. i would not recommend taking abilify. it has been shown to have many serious side-effects including affecting blood sugar results. while i understand that you do not want to give-up on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine.

Question: what are warning signs to see a dermatologist right away?
Baseline Response: if you see any signs of a dermatitis, it's because you're allergic to the skin, and there are several reasons for that. If you're a sensitive, sensitive person, it can cause a lot of problems.
What to look for:
The skin can become red, dark, and dry. It may become very oily and will get dark. It can also get very irritated.
It may get very dry. If it gets dry, you may feel a burning sensation in your skin. It's not a sign of an allergic reaction, but it could be that you're feeling the skin burning and you have a feeling that it's not going to burn.
This skin condition is called "inositol-like" dermatitis. Inositol is a type of skin condition that is characterized by a burning feeling, that's the burning sensation you get when you see redness in your

Question: what is dementia?
Baseline Response: dementia is a condition in which the brain does not function properly in the first place, and the brain itself is unable to function in the second.
The first major cause of dementia is the loss of nerve cells in the frontal lobes and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.
This is caused by a breakdown of the connections between the brain and the rest of the body, which is the primary cause of the disease.
According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of dementia in the United States is 5.3% of the adult population, but it is only 3.3 per cent of all adults.
These are the same number of dementia diagnoses that are made by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for all Americans.
It is estimated that over 1.2 million Americans have dementia, with more than 50,000 diagnosed with dementia in their lifetime.

Expected Response: we all forget things as we get older. many older people have a slight loss of memory that does not affect their daily lives. but memory loss that gets worse may mean that you have dementia. dementia is a loss of mental skills that affects your daily life. it can cause problems with your memory and how well you can think and plan. usually dementia gets worse over time. how long this takes is different for each person. some people stay the same for years. others lose skills quickly. your chances of having dementia rise as you get older. but this does not mean that everyone will get it. people rarely have dementia before age 60. but after age 85 up to half of all adults have it. if you or a loved one has memory loss that is getting worse see your doctor. it may be nothing to worry about. if it is dementia treatment may help. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Expected Response: the treatment of oa focuses on decreasing pain and improving joint movement. the following treatments are available. *over-the-counter pain-relieving medications: these include acetaminophen (tylenol for example) aspirin ibuprofen (advil and motrin) or naproxen (aleve). the antidepressant cymbalta (duloxetine) has been approved for osteoarthritis pain as well. some medications in the form of creams rubs or sprays may be applied over the skin of affected areas to relieve pain. *synvisc synvisc-one supartz and hyalgan: these medications can be given as injections to relieve pain in some people with osteoarthritis. *narcotics: stronger pain pills such as narcotics may be prescribed when osteoarthritis pain is severe and other treatments are not working. *joint protection devices: these can prevent strain or stress on painful joints. *hot or cold compresses: these treatments may be given in the form of a hot shower or bath or by applying heating pads or cold compresses. *surgery: when other treatment options have failed some people may need surgery to relieve chronic pain in damaged joints. * weight control: losing weight can prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints. * exercise: physical activity can improve joint movement and strengthen the muscles that surround the joints. gentle exercises such as swimming or walking on flat surfaces are recommended because they create less stress on joints. activities that increase joint pain (jogging high-impact aerobics etc. ) should be avoided. if you have arthritis talk to your doctor to find out the best exercise routine for you. * alternative therapy: acupuncture and bioelectric therapy may be able to provide some pain relief. some medical research has shown that the supplements glucosamine and chondroitin may relieve some pain in some people with osteoarthritis especially in the knee. some people also use methylsulfonylmethane (msm) for arthritis but there is less evidence showing its benefits. msm is a naturally occurring sulfur that is taken as a dietary supplement.

Question: my mom is allergic to bactrim and was told since she is allergic to it that she's also allergic to sulfa is this true?
Baseline Response: My mom is a big fan of bactriol. Bactriolate is a natural ingredient and has been shown to be safe to use in people with sensitive skin. B.A.P.S. If you are allergic to a substance that is not listed in this document, please contact your local health department.
My name is Stephanie and I am from the USA. I am a self taught and very social girl and I love to read, write, and dance. I was born and raised in North Carolina.

My love for music has always been a love of music. I love playing guitar

Expected Response: yes because bactrim is a sulfa drug ( sulfa methoxidole/trimethoprim)
================================================================================
Question: what activities should i not do while pregnant?
Baseline Response: I am very concerned about the future of my unborn child and I am trying to ensure that we can have a child on our own. I am not the only one who has had this situation.
The situation I am in is quite dire. There are so many babies that are being born at the moment that I have no choice but to go to the hospital. I have to go on maternity leave to deal with the situation. I do not know if I will be able to take care of them at the time.
I have to be very careful. The hospital will not allow me to take up my maternity leave. I don't know if they will allow me. I think that I will have to stay at home and take care and help my baby.
There is no alternative. I can't do anything. I cannot leave my house without my baby and that is what I am doing.
What I am

Expected Response: change the cat's litter box. cat feces can transmit an infection called toxoplasmosis which can lead to severe problems in newborns including low birth weight jaundice mental retardation and convulsions. use saunas hot tubs and tanning booths. excessive heat can be harmful to the baby and has been linked to spinal malformations. paint. let somebody else paint the baby's room; pregnant women shouldn't be exposed to toxic substances and chemicals which include paint and cleaning solvents. get an x-ray. unless you absolutely have to avoid tests like x-rays and mammograms while pregnant which can be dangerous to your growing baby. if you absolutely must have an x-ray make sure that your doctor or dentist knows you are pregnant so they can take extra precautions. ride the great american scream machine or the tower of terror. there is concern that the rapid stops and jarring forces of rides like this could cause placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall). play it safe and stick to the ferris wheel until the baby's born.

Question: can titty twisters cause cancer?
Baseline Response: you can. There are a few things that can cause cancer, but the most common is the presence of a tumor. A tumor can be found in the skin or the stomach of a person, and is caused by a tumor within the cells of the body.
A cancer can also be found within the liver, kidney, or pancreas, which can also cause cancer.
There are three types of cancer:
Tumor-causing tumors that can spread to the bloodstream and spread to other parts of the brain. These tumors can cause serious brain damage, especially in the elderly.
Tome-caused tumors that spread to another part of the system. These cancers can spread from one part of your body to the other, causing irreversible damage to the organs.
And, of course, there are many more types of tumors that could cause cancer!
The types of cancers that can affect your body include:

Expected Response: no. but this is not a nice thing to do or have. the nipples are very sensitive and should not be abused in this manner so give up the twisters and purple nurples.

Question: what is a blatocyst in pregnancy?
Baseline Response: It is a bacterial infection.
Fluidic acid is a precursor to the chemical lactobacilli, which are the primary bacteria of the body. In the body, lactobacs are the most abundant bacteria, with about 2% of the total.
The most common bacteria are called streptococci, which carry the bacterial name streptomyces. The streptobacillus is a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics.
Some bacteria are also called strep, which means "good" or "bad." Some bacteria are sometimes called "cromulent" bacteria, which is what we call them in the case of strep.
How can I tell if I am pregnant?
You can use a pregnancy test or a diagnostic test called the Intrauterine Device, which consists of a tube inserted into your uterus. If the test results negative, you can call a doctor or a nurse

Expected Response: a blastocyst is a fertilized egg after several days of cell division.

Question: i banged my thumb months ago and have had a black bruise under the nail since then. why has this not gotten better?
Baseline Response: this is because my nail has been in the right place for a long time and the nail is still so fresh. my nail is very fine, but when i applied it to the top of the nail it was very sharp. i was able to cut the nail back, but it took 2 years to get rid of it. if you look at the picture below, it's actually a nail that's in good shape, but is still a bit rusty. i think that the nail needs some work to get it back. if it's not in good condition, it could be a nail with a bad break.
Answer. i've had this nail for a month now and i have no idea how much it's been improving.
It's been a long while since I've had a nail. i don't know if it is a

Expected Response: it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma -- a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic.

Question: had sex with no condom during "fertile" days while on the pill. is it likely that i could get pregnant? . i have been on the pill for almost a year. my boyfriend and i are exclusive and are tested for stds. he ejaculated inside me with no condom on one of my "fertile" days. just a little nervous about getting pregnant and have another 2 weeks or so before my next period.
Baseline Response: yes.
So, if you were to take the pill twice a week for 3 weeks, the first time would be for 2 weeks. But once a week, once a month.
As for the second week, I think you can do that.
The second time would have to be the first week.
It would have a little bit of a long time before you get pregnant.
And, if the second time was to be a week long, you would have one week to live.
I think you could

Expected Response: hi but did you not say that your on the bc pill bc stands for birth control of which i think is about 99 5% wont get you pregnant. well in another two weeks get your self tested. if you was that worried why did you not use a plan b to late now though. hope this helps. good luck

Question: is it safe to put wart remover on a skin tag
Baseline Response: yes, it is, but if you want to keep your wart removers off, it's best to avoid it.
And if you're wondering if it's safe to keep wart remoneces on a tag, it really is, the same as the wart remonce on a diaper.
The only way to avoid wart remonres on a body is to use a cotton cloth, or you can use a gel that's been soaked in water.
Wat remover is an amazing thing, and is great for treating skin infections, so make sure you have a good treatment plan for wart remrecess.
How to use
Wet Remover is the best treatment for wart removal. It is very effective, and can be used in a variety of ways.
It is also very easy to apply to the skin.
This is because the wart is hard to remove.
In order

Expected Response: well it may not be dangerous but it won't help either. and you could get a mild skin burn. warts are caused by a virus. warts usually resemble hard rough bumps on the skin. they usually go away on their own after a few months. as you already know you can use an over-the-counter wart remover to help get rid of them faster. skin tags on the other hand are soft floppy growths of excess skin cells. they often occur in areas where clothing rubs the skin or where skin rubs against other skin. for example you might get skin tags around your neck where your shirt collar rubs or you may get skin tags in your groin area where the skin folds rub together. because skin tags are not caused by the virus that causes warts it won't do any good to put wart remover on them. if the skin tags are bothering you you can ask your health care provider to snip them off. it's a simple relatively painless procedure. unless the skin tags are very small you shouldn't try snipping them off yourself because you could experience excessive bleeding or scarring. ask your healthcare provider if it's ok for you to snip off your own skin tags before you attempt it yourself. skin tags can be really annoying! don't feel embarrassed to talk to your healthcare professional about how to get rid of them the next time you have an office visit.
================================================================================
Question: what causes emphysema?
Baseline Response: it is not as if the problem is caused by a defect in the air. Rather, it is caused as a result of a problem in the breathing system. This problem can be diagnosed by using an airway exam.
For more information about the issue of airway emphysis, see the Airway Emphysis FAQ and the Emphysemia FAQ.

Expected Response: in the vast majority of people smoking is the cause of emphysema. exactly how smoking destroys the air sac linings in the lungs isn't known. however studies show that smokers are about six times more likely to develop emphysema than nonsmokers. estimates vary but more than 10 million people in the u. s. likely have emphysema or another form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the fourth-leading cause of death in the country. interestingly most heavy smokers do not develop emphysema. why some smokers get emphysema and others do not is unknown. all heavy smokers experience other negative health effects of smoking though.

Question: child had been immunized for chickenpoks and came in contact with shingles virus during contagious stage can they get it. my child is scheduled for a surgery and has recently been exposed to the shingles virus during the open blister stage. obviously worried have pre-op this week but curious for answer prior to meeting with dr.
Baseline Response: yes.
The infection is caused by the chickenpox virus. the shingle virus is a small but deadly virus. my children have been vaccinated against the shingo virus and have not received any shingo bites.
Thank you for your question.
I am a family doctor who has been a member of the Immunization Committee of the National Immunization Information Center since 1997. Dr. John M. Neely has been one of the lead researchers in the field of immunization. Drs. M. and I have been able to understand the importance of the immunization and the immunizations. I would like to know how many

Expected Response: the incubation period for chicken pox virus (herpes) is about 2 weeks or so. causal exposure to someone with shingles in a child who has been immunized (i don't know your child's age or if your child had one or two vaccines) is not likely to lead to a disease outbreak. discuss it with her doctor anyway.

Question: can the sweat chloride be high without having cystic fibrosis?
Baseline Response: no.

Expected Response: there are a few rare conditions that produce a false positive sweat chloride test. such situations include diseases of the adrenal thyroid or pituitary glands; rare lipid storage diseases; and infection of the pancreas. generally however these children are easily differentiated from patients with cystic fibrosis by their clinical condition and molecular tests for cystic fibrosis can be done to clarify the diagnosis.
================================================================================
Question: is a vegan diet healthy for my 3 year old son?
Baseline Response: Yes.
A vegan diet is a diet that is high in animal products and low in processed foods.
There are many different vegan diets and their variations vary greatly.
Here are a few of the most common vegan diets that are available to you:
The vegan diet has a high percentage of meat, dairy, eggs, and refined sugar.
The vegetarian diet is low in animal protein and low on refined sugar and carbs.
And the vegetarian diet has the lowest cholesterol and fat content of any vegan diet.
Do you have any questions about vegan diets? Let us know in the comments below!

Expected Response: with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!

Question: can asthmatics develop an advair dependency? i'm an infrequent user but find the more i use it the more i need it.
Baseline Response: yes, but it requires that asthmatic need to have the asthmic dependency to be able to see.

Asthma: A disease that causes the asthematis to experience pain or discomfort. Asthma is a disease that requires the asthm to be asthmed.
A disease that can cause asthmal to be painful or uncomfortable.
An asthmatic can have an asthmet, a asthmental, or a asthma dependent asth.
If you're looking to develop a asthemet, you have to have an ametal or an asthematic dependency. This means that you

Expected Response: there are two types of asthma medication. one is a rescue (albuterol or xopenex) that is used as needed for symptoms. the other is a controller therapy that is used every day to prevent symptoms. advair is a controller therapy and should be used daily instead of as needed. typically use of the drug should not cause you to need it more.

Baseline Response: you can use the following exercise program to achieve your goals:
1. Exercise:
2. Exercise 2: Exercise 2 (2-5 weeks):
3. Exercise 3: Exercise 3 (5-8 weeks):

Expected Response: most helpful answer the easy answer would be any exercise. find an activity that you like. it can be as simple as walking (aerobic) or even taking up a sport like tennis. the best exercise program is really one that you will do on a regular consistent basis at least three or more times per week. find a partner - it is easier to exercise with a friend.
================================================================================
Question: is erythema multiforme an autoimmune disorder?
Baseline Response: A. My condition is an autoimmune disease. It is characterized by a combination of immune system disorders including autoimmune encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and amyloidosis. The condition is characterized on the basis of the diagnosis of myeloidosis, a type of myelin defect in the left hand. Myelin is formed when cells in the right hand are exposed to an environment where the right side of the body is exposed to a high amount of water. The right side is exposed because the left side of your body is often exposed to high amounts of water, which causes inflammation and the body will produce a high concentration of antibodies to protect against these conditions.
B. Myeloiditis is a condition that is characterized in part by the presence of the inflammation. Myeli is a type that is a result of a combination or combination of the two. Myetis is a disease characterized by the appearance

Expected Response: erythema multiforme is considered a hypersensitivity disorder not an autoimmune disorder. <link>

Question: what problems should i watch for during the first trimester of my pregnancy?
Baseline Response: it's important to watch for the first 5 days of pregnancy. The first few days of a pregnancy are important for your health. It can be scary to watch the first few months of pregnancy and even more scary when you get pregnant.
What should I watch for in pregnancy? You can watch for a variety of symptoms during the second trimester and the first 10 days of the pregnancy.
How much should I expect during the period of pregnancy? If you're pregnant, you should expect at least 3 to 6 weeks. If you expect to have babies in the second half of the first month, you're probably going to have to expect at most 4 to 6 months. If the first 2 to 3 months are going to be challenging, you might be better off to expect less.
The first trimesters are important because they can cause the baby to have more and more problems.

Question: can your blood sugar spike when your pregnant. i have friend who is pregnant and her blood sugar was really high when she had her blood sugar taken at the hospital and when she went home her mom monitored her blood sugar and it was normal and she hasn't ever had any problems with her blood sugar. is this normal?
Baseline Response: it is normal.
Answer #2: You can get pregnant with a baby who has a very high blood sugar when she has a low blood sugar, but that is not normal. If she is pregnant with another baby, she will likely have a high blood glucose level when she is having a low glucose level.
Solution #3: If you have a baby that is healthy and has normal blood sugar levels, but your blood glucose is high, you should take her out of the hospital for a blood test and see if she can tolerate it.
Note: if your baby is healthy, and her glucose levels are normal, your blood sugars are normal

Expected Response: you may want to talk to your ob/gyn about gestational diabetes. it isn't uncommon for women to have trouble with their blood sugar when they are pregnant.

Question: can a viral infection cause knee problems? my boyfriend's knees are stiff and painful. his knee caps are ok. thnak you
Baseline Response: no. not a problem. thrk you.
Answer #2: what do you do when you see someone with a knee problem? they need to be treated and can't walk.
The main problem with knee problems is that they are often painful. But they are also easy to get over, and can help with arthritis, arthritis, etc.
I have been trying to figure out how to deal with these pain. The first step is to try to remove the pain.
You can make a plaster of your knee. The plaster is placed on your leg and then on the skin of your leg. You can then apply a gentle massage on the spot.
Once the plaster is removed, you can remove the plaster and replace it.
Thinking about it, I have had this happen to me. My friend is

Expected Response: a viral infection should not cause knee pain and stiffness. does he have pain in any other joints? if not he should see an ortopaedic md and have it looked at. he should try to excercise as often as he can by walking. he certainly should not try running as running puts a lot of strain on the knees and the joints of the knees. his knee caps may "look" ok but just looking at them isn't enough to tell if he has something more serious possibly needing in the future knee replacement. he should try taking aleve or some otc medication walk as much as he can and consult his physician

Baseline Response: i am not a retiree and will get a refund of $2.50 for each $1 in the lifetime limit.
Answer 1:
The second question is the same as the first, but if you read the answer correctly, you will know that the refund is a full refund.

Expected Response: unfortunately retiree health insurance plans are exempt from a number of affordable care act provisions including limits on annual and lifetime payouts. unlike with an offer of affordable employee health however as a retiree younger than age 65 you are eligible to shop for coverage through the exchanges set up under the law. and if your income qualifies you may be able to get financial help to lower the cost of your plan. it's worth checking out your options now during open enrollment at healthcare. gov. none of the plans sold there are allowed to impose lifetime or annual limits and they offer a host of other protections your retiree plan may not. you have until february 15 2015 to sign up for a plan for next year.

Question: what are the risks and options if you get pregnant with an iud?
Baseline Response: this is a very difficult question. It is the first question to answer. A lot of people who are pregnant with a baby are trying to figure out what to do with the baby. It's not uncommon to have a baby and have to go through a lot of stuff. But there are lots of other things that can happen. The risk of a miscarriage can be a very high one. A couple of things can happen, but these are the first things that you should know.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about the risks of pregnancy and how to know if you are pregnant.
You can get pregnant by any of the following:
1. You are pregnant by a man.
2. You have been pregnant for a while.
3. You go to a doctor.
4. You get an abortion.
5. You die.
What are the chances

Expected Response: this is a real problem. when a patient gets pregnant with an iud in we try and remove it as quickly as possible. when we are not able to remove it there is not much else to do but to cross our fingers and pray that everything will go well. the biggest risk is preterm labor premature rupture of the membranes infection all that lead to pregnancy loss. this is not to say that all patients will have this happen but it certainly is a higher risk. we do not try and remove it once the pregnancy is well on its way as this may make things worse.

Expected Response: congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption. you are describing a condition called alcohol withdrawal syndrome. withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently. some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms. around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity. at this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control. some of these symptoms may include: sweating headache vomiting low grade fever black-outs intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others. withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation. in situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method. your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored. based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage i strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination a. s. a. p. to assess your overall health. it is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence. no matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain you're still ahead of where you would have been without stopping. over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better. i applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life. the challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into place. you just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot. if you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot. after years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we don't get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder. best wishes for your continued success.

Baseline Response: yes, i'm worried about my pregnancy. If i miss a pill, i can't take it. If I miss a birth control or birth control pills, i'll take them at the doctor's appointment. I don't want to be at risk for having a miscarriage or miscarriage or even having a bad pregnancy.

Question: i have yellowish bumps on the instep of my feet
Baseline Response: The bumps on my feet are very small, about 6-7 cm.
The bump on my foot is very large, about 8 cm. The bumps on your feet are small, 1 cm. I have seen a few people who have seen them with a little bit of skin on the foot.
If you are going to have a rash or anything else, please check the doctor.
Do not go without a diaper and take off your clothes if possible.
Are you allergic to sun exposure?
If so, check with your doctor. If not, check your doctor's website for a medical history.
What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of sun exposure are:
Skin rash on the feet, called tanning (the skin that covers the feet).
Skin discoloration on the toes.
Skin itching on the hands and feet.
Pale, red, and sometimes green

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose a skin ailment without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider. he or she can look at the bumps and tell you what they are and whether or not they need to be treated. weird bumps on the feet aren't unusual because the feet take a beating from walking and get exposed to all kinds of viruses and bacteria that may be lurking on floors in carpets and so on. fortunately most of these bumps aren't serious and don't cause much harm -- other than looking funky! your primary care provider can tell you what's going on and refer you to a foot doctor if necessary. good luck!

Question: burn on foot. i spilled scalding water on my foot while cooking. i put what on it immediately followed by ice. 14 hrs later it is red and severely uncomfortable in a part of the burn. it turns white when touched but if i leave the ice off for more than ten minutes the severe pin returns. what should i do?
Baseline Response: put on a towel and wait for the hot water to cool.
Answer of the day: i used a few ounces of scalded water and it was much better than the others. i also used some water from the grocery store and it worked well.

Expected Response: see a medical provider. it is not possible to blindly make patient-specific decisions about a burn over the internet. most scald burns are second degree and can be extensive. some will require prescription burn ointments and special burn dressings to limit scarring and tissue contractures. and you may need something more than otc medications for the pain. see a medical provider.

Baseline Response: the amoxilin is not safe. the ampicillin is safe for use in an antibiotic or if a patient gets the flu.

Expected Response: it is safe. if you have a yeast infection and really need it. difulcan is not a preventative.

Answer. i know what it's like to have a period. i can feel that your period is just a part of it. but i can't help but feel that it's your own fault.
I've never had a bad experience with a period and i don't know how it could have happened to anyone else.
What should I do?
If you have any questions or comments, feel free to e-mail me.
If I'm wrong, I'll try to correct it.

Expected Response: i can't speak to the clinical aspect of your issue but to get your condition checked out without insurance you can try a few things. call a doctor in your area and ask how much the out-of-pocket cost would be for a check-up. if you offer to pay cash you may be able to negotiate a rate you can afford. sometimes services like zocdoc. com can be useful for people without insurance to find someone in your area. you can also try an urgent care clinic (search for one at the urgent care association of america: www. ucaoa. org/index. php or a community health clinic -- search for one in your area here: www. findahealthcenter. hrsa. gov/search_hcc. aspx. good luck!

Question: can food and nutrients reverse the aging process?
Baseline Response: YES! It is possible to reverse the age-related decline in the body's ability to metabolize nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and protein. But what happens when the body has lost so much of its ability to utilize nutrients?
The answer: it is not as simple as it sounds.
If you are looking for a good diet plan, it is important to understand that there is no single answer.
How to determine your age-associated decline in metabolism
The following is a list of foods and nutrients that you can take to reverse aging, such that you are able to gain the same level of health and longevity as you did when you were young.
The below foods and nutrient lists are based on the best available research on the topic, but are not comprehensive and may be confusing.
Foods to Take to Reverse Aging
1. Lactobacillus spp.
This is the primary

Expected Response: first we have to talk about prevention. we can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock. but you can do things like not smoking. smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible. sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself. skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild. as for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin a is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources. carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks [and] even some green things like spinach and broccoli. collards are a great source of vitamin a. vitamin d -- your skin converts sun into vitamin d but a lot of people have this sun phobia. you can get vitamin d from fortified foods like orange juice and milk. research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin d. vitamin c is critical for wound repair -- for any type of tissue maintenance -- and that applies to your skin. tomatoes citrus kiwi -- they're all great sources. it is not necessary that every formulation gives the same effect just because these are intended for a same purpose. there are some anti-aging cream reviews that can let you know about some effective results these creams are able to produce. click here to know more details anti aging cream click here to know more details ==>> <link> i guess they can help. i am 79 years old and often asked what my secret is. people say i don't look my age. i only have one secret. i don't use any fancy skin creams just a moisturizer because my skin is dry. my secret? smile. especially when you look at yourself in the mirror. give that person the best welcoming smile you can come up with. that is your best friend sometimes your only friend. a smile makes you feel better and look younger. try it. it doesn't cost a thing. smile!

Question: can you get a uti from fecal matter (diarrhea) accidently entering the urethra?
Baseline Response: A fecal-injected urine specimen (e.g., urine of a newborn) is taken and a small amount of fecal material is inserted into the ureter. The stool is then drained and the urine is taken into a small syringe, which is then used as a test. The results of the urine test are given to a physician to make sure the fecal samples are correct.

Question: medication for prostate infection. i've been diagnosed with a bacterial prostate infection and have been prescribed a hefty dose of antibiotics. 400mg sparfloxacin daily and 200mg fluconazole daily starting with a 400mg dose. reading up on your webpage though beforehand i see that this combination is not recommended due to potentially serious side effects. should i just ignore both medications and seek new advice take one of them or.? after reading online i don't quite feel comfortable in going with this prescription. thanks.
Baseline Response: Well i do not think that the dosage should be taken every day. I would advise that if you do not want to take it every day you should go ahead and take the next dose.
So, if you are taking 400mg or 200mg sparfoxacins daily and you want to be sure that you don't overdose or you are concerned that you will die, do not take this medication every day for a year.
The dosage is given

Expected Response: hi when looking up info on line make sure you read a lot more than just one site this way you should get more than just one opinion all there all saying the same thing. then perhaps your doctor or gyno thinks by doing this its going to give it that extra kick for a cure sometimes it needs it. but as you say if your not happy find another doctor/gyno and get a second opinion but please explain why your doing it. good luck

Question: what is wrong with me red bumpy tonuge spots in throat bumps on scalp and other things. i am 24 i have been with my boyfriend for 6 years we have both been faithful the entire time these past few weeks or so tho i have been having some problems i noticed white spots and red bumps on my uvula and roof of my mouth then my tongue was sore so i looked and saw that on the left side most of my taste buds near the tip were swollen and raised and all along the front half is raised and very sensitive then when i went to the bathroom i noticed that i have one red spot on my clit. ne ideas
Baseline Response: why are these so often seen on the right side of your throat? you are right i have seen some red spots on my scalp but i have never seen the red spots. i have also had red bumps in my head and neck but i dont have any red bumps because i dont like to look in my mouth. im not

Expected Response: no one can be adequately diagnosed over the internet based solely on a description. you will need to be examined by a medical provider since there can be sooooo many reasons. it is possible that not all of your symptoms are "connected" (a person can have more than one medical issue at the same time). you may need a strep test for your throat. or even a test for mononucleosis but a medical provider would need to make that decision based on your examination findings.
================================================================================
Question: what can you tell me about adhd diets?
Baseline Response: it depends.
If you're following a ketogenic diet, you're going to be eating less fat, and you're not going to have a lot of fat. The difference between a keto diet and a calorie restriction diet is that the calorie restriction diets don't have as much of an impact on your body as the ketogenic diets.
It's pretty obvious that the keto diets are better for you than the calorie-restricted diet, but if you're trying to maintain a healthy weight, it's better to stick with the ketone body.
The ketogenic approach is the most important. It's just as important for you as the calorie/restriction diet.
I think that the most effective way to do that is to eat more carbs and to get rid of fat and all that.
And if you don't want to eat carbs, just eat fat.
Why is that?
You

Expected Response: diets are generally not effective -- especially for school-age children or teens. sugar and food coloring are not the cause of adhd nor are food allergies in general. (food coloring can have a small barely measurable effect but this is not the cause of your child's adhd. ) that said there are a few "nutriceuticals" that may improve adhd. studies are limited; the amount of benefit is likely to be less than medication and they may not benefit all kids with adhd.

Question: can i stop taking flomax once i have passed the kidney stone? . i am a generally healthy 52 year old female. last week i was diagnosed with a 5mm kidney stone and was prescribed flomax to help pass the stone. i passed it about three days later and now i am wondering if i can stop taking flomax. the urologist said i would have to take it for a month then have a follow up ultrasound to make sure i don't have hydronephrosis. i find the side effects i'm experiencing (headaches stuffy nose and nose bleed) very annoying.
Baseline Response: i am in the middle of an oral hysterectomy. i am about a month old and I am having a bad feeling. i feel like i'm having a hard time doing anything. i took flomoxate for about 6 months and i am now having to stop taking it. i have been taking flamethasone for about

Expected Response: i definitely would not stop taking the fosamax without first talking to your doctor. you don't want to risk having more problems with kidney stones. the side effects you list are not commonly associated with fosamax. of course everyone is different and it's possible that they're associated with the medicine but it could also be something else. there are also other medications similiar to fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine.

Question: how does the aca affect u. s. citizens living overseas?
Baseline Response: There is no direct effect of the ac on the citizens of any country. The ac is not the only cause of the effect of any nation's foreign policy. The Aca is also a part of the political system and can be used to influence policy of any government.
The Aca also affects the population of a country. In some countries, the ac can be a factor in the policies of the country, and in other countries, it is a factor of the policy of the government. The effects of the Aca on the population are often not known.
A few years ago, when I was a senior advisor to the President of the United States of America, I was asked if there was any suggestion in the media that we were a nation of immigrants, and I responded that I was not aware of any such suggestion.

Question: i need a real doctor's advice will she be pregnant? . i got carried away and ejaculated everything in her. we were standing up and she says that the penis wasn't really deep in her compared to last time we had sex. here's an additional information. her period started last january 5 and ended at 7. her period is normally around the first or second week of the month and lasts for 3 days. ovulation is at the half of the cycle which would be on the 21 or 22. we are gonna take ecp before the 24th hour though. please for us too. god bless.
Baseline Response: Answer #3:
i am still having a hard time with my ovulation. i'm not sure if it's due to the cold or because i'm in a bad mood. i just think it's a bit of a soreness or a feeling like i'm getting a bit tired of feeling like an idiot. i don't know if it

Expected Response: hi well taken ecp or plan b should get you out of your problem. look as men we love nothing better than riding bare back ok its great its how sex should be done but as you have now found out the hard way our sperm gives big problems that why condoms were made and bc was the big success it is. so if this is the way you want to go ahead then get your g/f or some kind of birth control the pill the ring or the cap but if she thinks of depo shot do have a good read about the side effects first just google depo shot side effects lots to read. do hope you have some help here. good luck

Question: what can cause an infant boys scrotum to swell? . my 10 month old son has developed an almond sized lump in his scrotal sac over the last two days. it has grown somewhat over the last 24 hours. it has not changed in color or shape just size. i can see his testicles and the lump is higher up in the scrotum right under his penis and a little to the left. i think it may be an inguinal hernia but am wondering if it could possibly be something else. anyone have an instances of this?
Baseline Response: I don't have a good answer to that. I'm not sure if there is any specific cause, but it is very unlikely that an inguininal herniation is a cause. I've seen the swelling of the scapula in the past. It's not as strong as the swelling I saw in my son's scrotus. The scapular is more like a normal hern

Expected Response: his pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him. it is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description. yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele. a torsion (twisting) is also possible but these are very painful and quite serious. i suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly "de-torse" in some children. either way an examine will be required to make that important determination. if he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis.

Question: how effective are allergy shots for asthma sufferers?
Baseline Response: As mentioned, allergy shots are a relatively small percentage of asthma sufferer's asthma. The majority of asthma allergy sufferers are allergic to many allergens, including soy, wheat, dairy, eggs, milk and some vegetables.
How effective are the allergy shots?
The most effective allergy shots is the 5 mg dose of allergy cream. This cream is more effective than the 10 mg dose. The 5 mg is the best choice for asthma in the US.
What about allergy to other allergens?
What are the best allergy shots to prevent allergy to allergy to:
Marijuana, peanuts, dairy products, eggs and milk.
The best allergy to peanut butter is the peanut butter allergy.
Which allergy shots should I use?
Eating disorders and allergic reactions are all different. These are different diseases that are more common in people with allergies.
If you have a history of allergies to other diseases,

Expected Response: for people with allergic asthma allergy shots (immunotherapy) can be effective at reducing allergic triggers to asthma. an allergist would evaluate to determine if he/she thinks you would benefit from allergy shots. asthma should be controlled as best as possible with medications before starting allergy shots. . because you are being injected with things you are allergic to there is a risk of having an allergic reaction. most patients do not have any side effects and those that experience side effects typically have localized itching and swelling at the injection side. in very rare cases people experience severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. most cases of anaphylaxis happen shortly after the allergy shots are given that is why you are required to be monitored in the clinic for a period of time. the allergy office is prepared with the needed medications to treat patients with severe reactions. the risk of a fatal reaction is extremely small but there have been a few cases of patients having fatal reactions. because of this it will be important that you understand the protocol and instructions for the allergy shots. there are many safety procedures in place to prevent serious reactions. if you have any questions about the protocol or risk you should thoroughly discuss with your allergist before starting.

Question: what can i do to find out if my fiance can produce children? . he doesn't want to be disappointed by finding out he can't produce when he wants a baby
Baseline Response: I will tell you that he is in no way discouraged by my decision to have a child. He just wants to see what it takes to make it work for him. He does not want to think about the consequences of what he has done or not done. The only thing he wants to do is get a job and get married. He has already found out that his fiance can't make it happen.

Solution: you have to make the decision to get married by choosing the best option.

Question: does body hair grow at the same rate as the hair on your head?
Baseline Response: yes, and there is a difference. The hair grows in the same way as the head.
The hair grows on the head is actually a hair follicle. The follicles are the small hairs that grow in the hair follicles and the hair that grow on the scalp.
Now that you've seen the difference in hair growth, you might think that this is a hair loss problem.
However, it is not. This is simply that the hair is growing on the hair and that the follicles on the body are growing on this body.
How does this happen?
The follicles that are growing are called the scalp follicles.
They are the hairs that are attached to your scalp. They are called follicles in the body. They do not grow on your body. If you are looking for a healthy scalp, the scalp is the best place to start.
When

Expected Response: generally yes. the difference is that it does not grow for as long -- only for a few months -- as the hair on your head which grows for a few years. that is why body hair reaches a certain usually shorter length then falls out.

Question: i have a hiatal hernia. it seems to bother me more after exercise especially after crunches. is there a connection?

Can i massage my achilles?
Solution: Yes, i can.
I can feel the pressure on my aching achilleus, i would be happy to do it.
You can also massage my lumbar spine, you can massage your achilias and your

Expected Response: i also have a hiatal hernia. this condition is caused when the abdominal organs start to poke thru the abdominal cavity and press against the diaphram. because of this when you do crunches you are putting pressure on the area that you have the hernia at. also when you do any exercise you tend to breath faster. this can be uncomfortable as well because the hernia is pressing on your diaphram which expands when you take a breath. i hope this helps!

Question: i am a 45 year old man and have little facial hair basically i have no sideburns. what can i do to promote hair growth? . i do have some facial hair (chin cheeks neck) but there are other bare patches as well. this didn't bother me when i was younger but as i age i would like the option of growing a beard to mask skin blemishes wrinkles etc. what are my options? what can i start to do on my own and if that doesn't work when should i consult my doctor?
Baseline Response: i can start by using a beard that is very long and strong. i am also a bit of a fan of the "gigantic" style beard. I have a large and muscular beard that doesn�t take up much space and does not get too big. i also like to shave my beard. i will be doing this for a long time and I will be able to use my beard more and more as time goes by

Expected Response: there is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair. if those hair follicles were not present when you were born you can't grow new ones. it is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get. i don't think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine. testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help. your first step is to see a dermatologist.

Expected Response: well it could be. or it might not be. low testosterone (or "low t") is the flavor-of-the-month in men's health. it's blamed for everything from lack of energy to low libido. and while low testosterone certainly might contribute to those things it's probably not the sole underlying cause. many things can cause slow weight loss and erectile dysfunction (ed). your best bet is to see your primary care provider for a range of blood tests. these basic tests can help pinpoint the cause(s) of your current health conditions and get you on the path to wellness. by the way good job on the diet and exercise! even though things are slow going keep up the good work. wishing you well!

Question: brown in color on the pill but planned parenthood told her it was the lack of good bacteria. true? . she is 22 years old has had 2 boyfriends and has lived with the second one for 2 plus years now. she was having lower abdominal slight pains and a brownish thicker periods. the planned parenthood gave her some medication and ran tests. tests came back ok and they advised her not to drink alcoholic beverages with this 2 week medication.
Baseline Response: this was a mistake. the pill was not a cure and the parenthood had been a mistake for a long time.

Expected Response: hi this bit below is from webmd so show her this it may help both of you. sometimes you may notice that your menstrual blood becomes dark brown or almost black as you near the end of your period. this is a normal colour change. it happens when the blood is older and not being expelled from the body quickly. temporary thick heavy flow isn't necessarily cause for concern. however regular heavy periods justify a trip to the doctor to check your blood counts. many women become accustomed to heavy periods considering them to be normal. over time though the excess monthly blood loss leads to anemia potentially causing weakness or fatigue. if you ever feel something's not right with your period see your health care provider. as for the pains could be just cramping has she had anything like this before? do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: is there a drug interaction between synthroid and prevacid?
Baseline Response: not yet.
In the last couple of months I've been looking into this.
One of the things I was surprised at was the fact that the drug had been shown to be able to alter the activity of a small molecule in a molecule that is involved in metabolism. So there was some question about the fact of a drug that is able to change the activity. It seems like there are a number of interesting things that are happening with this. The drug has been shown, for example, to change a protein involved in the action of the enzymes that make up the protein. It has been found that it can alter the action, too. It is not known whether the drug is able or not, but it seems like it is very interesting.
What I would say is that the idea that it has been demonstrated to be a drug, to be effective in changing the activity and to alter metabolism is really interesting

Expected Response: currently there are no drug interactions found between synthroid and prevacid. however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist. it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products. prevacid should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal. synthroid should be taken 30 minutes to one hour prior to a meal. they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach.

Question: what does genital herpes look like?
Baseline Response: It looks like a man's penis.
Answer to question: what do you do when you get your first headache?
Solution: You take a small amount of caffeine and have it in your mouth. It's a good idea to start with some small amounts of caffeine.

Expected Response: anything from classic blisters that ooze pus after bursting and scab and heal over to almost imperceptible lesions red marks white areas and other hard to notice patches. men and women may have differences too. there is some good info at this site: www. viradux. com. they also sell a crème that is the only thing that has worked for me. i have not had an outbreak in over a year. hope this helps!
================================================================================
Question: what could be causing my scalp to suddenly become dry and flaky?
Baseline Response: The answer is that you have a lot of bacteria in your scalp. If you have any of these bacteria, they will spread to your scalp and cause it to become wet.
What's the best way to prevent this?
A quick and easy solution: you can use a natural cleanser to help clean the area of your scalp that's causing your scalp to dry out.
How to Use It
To use a cleanser, simply rub your face with your hands and apply it with your fingers. Then, gently wipe the area with a damp cloth. The cleansing will take about 10 minutes.
It's important to note that the cleanser will not cause any dryness. However, the amount of bacteria that will grow in the area can be a lot, and it is important to keep in mind that the amount you use depends on how much of your body is exposed to the bacteria.

Expected Response: to figure this out first look at what type of hair products you are using. certain shampoos can be harsh or drying to the scalp. try switching to a shampoo that is marketed for dry hair or one that claims to add moisture to your hair. if this doesn't help you may need to see your local dermatologist to have your scalp examined for psoriasis seborrhea or another form of scalp dermatitis. a biopsy may be necessary to fully understand what's going on.

Answer 1: im 23, im 23 year old, i graduated from college and am now 23. am 25, i hope to be married and have kids in a couple years. am 26, im 26, i dont want to do anything

Expected Response: most helpful answer i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds frightening! i'd advise you to seek medical attention as soon as possible. any time a person has heart-related symptoms it's a good idea to get checked out by a doctor. while serious heart conditions aren't very common in people your age it's still a good idea to have the situation evaluated. your health care provider probably will want to run a series of tests including a blood test to check things like your hormone levels and overall blood count. he or she also may run other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ekg) or even a holter monitor which is portable ekg device. anxiety can produce symptoms similar to what you're describing too. however do not try to self-diagnose this. your health care provider will be able to figure out what's causing your symptoms and how to treat them (if at all). good luck to you!

Question: i have tried aloe for sunburn but it doesn't seem to help. can i use burow's solution or aspirin?
Baseline Response: Yes, but i have a feeling that burow does not have a good answer.
Answer 6: Is this the only solution?

Expected Response: believe it or not aloe is a popular product that's available on all the shelves but there is no evidence that it actually works in helping sunburns. so this is actually a good question. burow's solution is usually used for poison ivy. it helps relieve the itching not necessarily redness or inflammation. so the rule of thumb is if you have sunburn what you want to do is definitely use cool compresses or sit in like a cool tub filled for about 15-20 minutes. you can take things like tylenol or advil to help alleviate any type of pain. but if the sunburn is really bad and you start breaking out in blisters you need to see a medical professional for additional prescription products and also just to be evaluated to make sure you didn't do any additional damage to the skin.

Question: what organ controls blood pressure. what organ regulates our blood pressure causing it to rise or lower?
Baseline Response: what we call the blood pressure control organ. If you look at what we do on our website, we don't have any blood pressure charts or other information on it.
What's the difference between the blood pressures of a person and a person without a blood pressure monitor?
What happens if you have a blood sugar monitor? If you have any other tests you can get a blood glucose monitor to check your blood pressure or any other test that is used to check blood pressure, but it doesn't have to be a blood test.
If you have diabetes or any of the other diseases you can also use a blood tests to check for diabetes, but they will not be available to you.
How does the blood sugar test work?
The blood sugar level changes according to the level of sugar in the blood.
A blood sugar meter is a computer program that monitors the

Expected Response: the brain. there really is no one organ that controls blood pressure. blood pressure is controlled through how much blood goes through your heart and a delicate body balance achieved through the cardiovascular central nervous and urinary systems. neurotransmitters in the brain signal the heart to beat quicker and increase blood pressure when it becomes too low. the change in your heart beating then changes the volume and force of blood going through the kidneys and the sodium balance. this action further impacts the fluid in your blood vessels and either lowers or increases your blood pressure.

Question: can a woman get pregnant if she had her period 2 days after sex and it was heavy the first day and light 3 days after? . i had sex with a guy the other night. he used a condom but for some reason did not last very long (5 minutes). he pulled it out the second he started ejeculating in the condom and completely finished outside of me. the condom fit perfectly and nor did it tear or nothing leaked out. we had sex june 9th at 1 am. the first day of my last period was may 15th to may 20th. my periods are irregular and come different days in the month. i began my heavy period again june 11th lasting 4 days.
Baseline Response: no, this is not a problem. I have a mild case of sexual dysfunction. The problem is that I am not getting pregnant. I am also not getting into sex with the guy. I will continue to use condoms and try to avoid being pregnant.

Expected Response: a woman can theoretically become pregnant anytime she has unprotected sex but in reality there are only a few days per month that you can actually conceive. based on what you have shared you were not likely at at time of ovulation and your sperm encounter was outside and not intravaginally. it would be highly unlikely that you would become pregnant in this event.

Question: where can i get the cheapest morning after pill since i don't have insurance?
Baseline Response: http://www.miamie.com/health-plan.html
Answer : http://blog.miamiherald.com
Answer 1: http.mahav.com.au
Answer 2: http:mahaven.com

Expected Response: when it comes to inexpensive pharmaceuticals you may need to call around to various pharmacies and even planned parenthood and ask prices. i don't think you will find that much variation in price. since this is over the counter insurance may not cover it anyway even if you had it. remember that this is the "morning after" pill so you don't have that much time to comparison shop. i can assure you that if you are hoping to prevent a pregnancy as a result of unprotected sex the consequences of not doing this promptly is going to be a lot more expensive if you know what i mean. this method may be pricey if you are on a tight budget but it is too late to use condoms now. they would have been less expensive so lesson learned.

Baseline Response: shingled skin has a lot of potential to cause shingling in the ear or jaw.
(1) There is no cure for shingle.
2) Shingles do not cause shibs.
3) There are no herpes zoster shots.
4) Shinkles do NOT cause shinkles.
5) There has been no studies that show herpes zostatic disease is caused by shinkling in any other type of skin.
6) There does not exist any evidence that shinkled skin causes shinglings.
7) There do not exist

Question: has anyone experienced strong vaginal odor while going through menopause?
Baseline Response: yes, it is possible, but it is not certain.

Expected Response: the most common cause of bad odor coming from the vagina is a condition called bacterial vaginosis also called gardnerella. the odor stems from an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that causes a strong fishy odor. the odor is worse after intercourse because the ph of the semen causes more of the odor to be released. prescription pills or cream can usually eliminate the bacterial imbalance. in premenopausal women a not uncommon cause of bad odor is a forgotten tampon. removal of the tampon will correct the problem. gentle cleansing of the vulva with clean water is usually sufficient for hygiene. any soap can be irritating to the vulva and in some cases can cause dermatitis skin irritation or rash. in most cases douching is not recommended. a very strong or unusual odor should be evaluated by a clinician. yes; i was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop- just kind of cold turkey. i had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came. my general health care provider could not help me. i found a gynocologist who would see me. (i was turned down by one who said i was too old. ) he put me on vagifem and it cleared up. that was three years ago. the experience was very traumatic.

Question: i have schizophernia and manic depression what medication should i take
Baseline Response: diazepam is the most effective way to treat these problems.
How to Treat a Depression
1. If you have a manic episode, it's best to get rid of it immediately. This is not going to work in most cases.
2. If the symptoms are very severe and you feel like you are getting better, then get your medication. If it is going to cause a seizure, then you may need to try a different medication.
3. If your symptoms are severe, you may not need to take your medication and it may be better to wait until the symptoms have cleared.
4. If symptoms are mild, you can start taking a second medication. This will help you take the medicine at the same time.
5. If there is no medication in your system, try another medication. It will help to take a second medicine at a later time. If not

Expected Response: unfortunately there is no way anyone could recommend a medication for you here on this site. there are many medications and combinations of medications that might be used to treat schizophrenia and depression and your doctor or medical team together will know your health history best and which medications or other treatments would be best for you and your health. we hope you'll work closely with your doctor or doctors to find a treatment that will help. the webmd answers staff

Question: my lower right side of abdomen has been hurting. can it be my ovary? . i have been to the er and urgent care thinking it was my appendix. they has told me that it might be my ovaries but didn't check them. the pain comes and goes but it hurts the most when i am sitting down. can it be my ovaries? does having cyst in the ovaries cause a female not to get a menstrual cycle? i have also been trying to get pregnant and no luck. <negative_smiley>
Baseline Response: My lower right abdomen has not been hurt by the ovary. my ovars are not swollen. but my lower left side is. it is too small for my uterus to get into. it also makes my ovules so small that they are not big enough for my vagina to go in. i have had several ovaries as well but my uterus is not swollen like a lot of my other uterus. i am a big girl

Expected Response: you don't have appendicitis because appendicitis is not a come and go pain. appendicitis is extremely painful. the thing you have is actually caused by extra fluid form your system being trapped in your air vent. but if you are trying to become pregnant do not put too much pressure on yourself. that is probably why you have abdomen pain. and you can also take women pills for pregnancy. that wont really make you pregnant but it will prepare your body for pregnancy. you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have abdomen pain and you think it is from your ovaries.

Question: i am taking strattera and the generic of celexa. is that safe for a pregnancy?
Baseline Response: What is safe for the fetus is the safe for your child to be in and the safe to be exposed to.
A fetus is not a small child. A fetus is a human being. It is a body that is constantly changing and evolving.
It is a very important part of your body.
What are the risks for you if you are pregnant?
A pregnancy is a serious health problem. It can be life threatening and life threatening. It's a real risk for your family, your child, your grandchildren, your children's children.
You should not take any medications. You should not use any drugs. You have to make sure your body is doing its job.
There are two main risks for a pregnant woman:
A. She is exposed to a lot of substances.
B. She can get infected with HIV.
C

Expected Response: i always get questions like this in my practice setting and i am more than happy to assist since pharmacists are the medication experts. we do not have enough data for these two medications and they should only be used based on a physician’s evaluation and there is a clear understanding of the risks and benefits.
================================================================================
Question: what should i do if i suspect an overdose of gavilyte-n?
Baseline Response: I should always seek medical help for my symptoms if I suspect that I am overdosing. I usually ask for my physician to refer me to a specialist to discuss the diagnosis of an overdose. The specialist will then advise me of the specific symptoms and how to proceed.
In the case of overdosing, the specialist will usually tell you that your medications may be over-the-counter and/or that you should try a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug (NSAIDS) to help manage the symptoms.
If you are taking a nonsteroidal-tetanus (NSAIDs) pill, you should be taking the pills slowly and gradually. I believe that this is the best way to treat your symptoms and that you will benefit from a quick treatment.
What if I feel like my symptoms are too severe?
If your symptoms are very severe,

Expected Response: if overdose is suspected contact your poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.

What are the recommended dosages of vitamin C and o for early Alzheimer's patient? The recommended dosage for early Alzheimer's patient is 1-2 hours per day.
Is there any nutritional supplement that you can take before starting to look for vitamin c?
There are no nutritional supplements that you should take before your first Alzheimers, but if you do have one, it should be taken within the first 3 months.
I'm looking for a friend who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and has been prescribed vitamin c for their first AlZheimers. Can I ask for a referral to a clinic?
Yes, you can get

Expected Response: there are no "recommended doses" of either vitamin. studies have not proven that vitamin c or e have any therapeutic or preventative effects in the management of early alzheimer disease. with that said you can certainly use them at regular recommended doses but mega-doses would not likely be helpful.

Question: i had a tubal 10 years ago i am having early pregnancy symptoms could it be i am pregnant?
Baseline Response: no, i am not pregnant.
Answer #2: i am an extremely rare condition that has been in the family for decades.

Expected Response: my cousin had this situation. she thought there was no way she could be pregnant after 12 years of the one tube she had left (due to a tubal pregnancy if the other) being burnt and tied. she called her ob/gyn and the dr. told her if she was pregnant it was most likely a tubal. she packed a bag thinking she would be put in the hospital for surgery. the dr. did an ultrasound and she was almost two months pregnant. her and the baby were very healthy. but it was a big surprise. she was 39 and thought she was through having kids. now she is the mother of a 23 year old a 18 year old and a 6 year old. good luck! either way all babies are a blessing!

Question: i have a burning sensation in my face neck and ears that comes and goes. what could be causing this? . just curious to what could be going on. i suspect high bloodpressure but am not able to see my doctor until april 4 due to her being booked up until then. i am really worried that it could be something very serious. please help?
Baseline Response: i am a registered nurse and have been in a very bad situation since July 11th. i have been diagnosed with hypertension and have to go to a doctor in order to see what is going on and what could possibly be going wrong. i can't do anything about it until i go to the doctor. i will take my medication and it will be fine. I will just have to wait and see how things go. i hope this clears up quickly. i would like to know if you can help me with my situation, or if you could help me in any way. if you have any questions or concerns

Expected Response: i have the exact same symptoms. they come and go in intensity but i am getting it very often these days. i think it is because our nerves are irritated from being damaged. my theory is that it is herpes as that virus lives in nerve cluster behind the ear. and the herpes zooster and many viruses reside in nerves and herpes kills nerve cells causing them to become irritated leading to a burning sensation. this is why so many people have this problem but have no clue what is the reason most people have no idea they have herpes. it is most likely to be triggered by a number of reasons. but being fit keeping your immune system healthy and eating foods that don't trigger the virus should greatly help possibly keep it completely at bay.

Question: should i watch tv in bed if i have insomnia?
Baseline Response: yes, i do. I like to watch tv on a laptop. But the only thing i can really do is go to bed and sleep on it. I think that is fine with me, it is just that I am not able to do it.
Answer 1: I would rather watch tv than sleep on my laptop.
Reply: I watch tv to sleep on a computer.
I have a TV with a TV player. I use it to watch TV when i am not at work or when i'm bored. But when i sleep I have to watch a movie to make sure that i get a good night's sleep. I don't like to sleep at night because of the fact that I wake up at the same time. I will usually wake up after 7:00. I do not like to wake up when I am at work. I prefer to wake when I have time to go to the

Expected Response: well i am a little bit different in the respects that most doctors especially sleep specialists will say you should have no tv in the bedroom. i actually disagree. i have a select group of patients where they can’t turn their brains off and that’s why they have insomnia. if they could just watch some mundane television show to help them fall asleep they fall asleep very well. so what i tell people is if you’re going to fall asleep with the tv on just have a tv timer that will switch your tv off.

Question: does isoniazid affect the good bacteria in digestive system. what are some side effects?
Baseline Response: some may not be relevant to you. Some may be causing your digestive system to become sluggish or irritable, and some may be affecting your eyes. Some of these may be due to the presence of other drugs, antibiotics, or other medications that are not necessary for normal digestion. In addition, some may also be due directly to the food you eat. In some cases, you may find it difficult to digest food. It's not a good idea to get a special diet to help with your digestion. Also, you might find that some of the food that is not healthy is more likely to be harmful to you than healthy foods.
In other words, if you're going to eat a healthy diet, then you need to try to find the foods that are more nutritious. This is especially true if you are concerned about whether you'll be able to digest the food in the

Expected Response: hi this is from site and this is the link to it <link> for more help just google the link to the www. to open and read. isoniazid may cause severe and sometimes fatal liver problems (eg hepatitis). the risk of liver problems is greater in patients older than 35 years old. it may also be increased by daily use of alcohol long-term liver problems or unsanitary injectable drug use. women especially those who are black are hispanic or have just had a baby may also be at increased risk. hepatitis can develop at any time during treatment but usually occurs during the first 3 months. your doctor will monitor your liver function and discuss your progress every month. contact your doctor right away if you develop unusual fatigue weakness or fever that lasts longer than 3 days general feeling of discomfort loss of appetite nausea vomiting numbness or tingling of the hands or feet dark urine yellowing of the skin or eyes or stomach pain or tenderness. your doctor may decide to slowly restart isoniazid after these symptoms disappear and lab tests return to normal. patients with active liver problems should not use isoniazid. your find lots more info on site this does not seem a very nice drug to be taken. good luck

Question: can a male get genital herpes from performing oral sex on uninfected female?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer to question: can women get genital HPV from performing genital sex on an uninfectered female?

Expected Response: i can't see how unless he is very lucky and talented. you don't get genital herpes by touching someone with your mouth the most you'd get is oral herpes. you don't get any kind of herpes by touching an uninfected person. so the only way a man could get genital herpes by giving an uninfected woman oral sex is if the female had just had sex with someone with the condition and he left his fluids on her then another man had oral sex with her then gave himself fellatio. highly unlikely.

Question: is it safe to use nail polish while pregnant
Baseline Response: "Yes, it is safe to wear nail polish in the home," says Dr. Eric Whelan, MD, of the University of Texas at Austin. "I think that it's safe to put nail polish on your baby's baby's skin, but it's not safe to do that at home."
He adds, "It's important to note that even if you're using nail polish, the bottle doesn't prevent your baby from getting pregnant. That's because the nail polish doesn't break down the skin. It keeps the baby's blood from getting to the baby."
The FDA has a rule that states that "when using a nail polish to clean or prevent pregnancy, the nail must not be used on the skin of the baby".
The company is also not responsible for any irritation caused by the nail polishes.
If your baby is in the first two weeks of pregnancy, it's best to

Expected Response: phthalates which are found in many nail polishes have been studied for a potential risk of causing birth defects. however evidence does not currently suggest a connection between phthalates and birth defects in humans. but studies in animals have shown these substances interfere with male sexual development so caution may be warranted. to be on the safe side you can use phthalate-free nail polish. or polish your nails in a well-ventilated area to limit your exposure. once the polish dries there's little risk to your baby since chemicals aren't absorbed through the nails. here's a great article on pregnancy-proofing your beauty regimen. i personally avoided most nail polish when i was pregnant. the story below says to avoid polish with phthalates which have been linked to birth defects. look at the ingredients list on your polish to be sure. if you go to a salon and are not sure if they carry phthlate-free brands take your own. some brands said to be free of phthlates include essie revlon and l'oreal but remember to check the label as they come out with new types all the time. none of these links are definitely proven of course but why not play it safe until we know for sure? <link>

Question: could i conceive 2day before my fertile window days? . hello im trying to conceive my period was oct 8 to oct11 had unprotected sex on oct 13 i believe its two days before my fertile window days could i possibly have a chance of pregnancy? thank you
Baseline Response: i think you can have a pregnancy when you are ovulating. If your ovulating is normal, then you should have a baby by 2 days before your ovulation date.
Answer 2: No. The only thing that matters is your ovulatory cycle. If you have no ovulatory cycles, you don't have a fertile window. If not, then your ovulate is normal and you have a normal period. If it is your fertile window day, then it is likely that your ovular period will be normal.

Expected Response: hi your find that most will say ovulation day is around day14 give or take a day so yes by that you could get pregnant and this allows 3 days for the sperm to reach the womb that's how long its takes sperm to get there and it can live for up to 10 days max. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is the recovery period for bilateral knee replacement?
Baseline Response: The recovery period is now over. There is no further discussion on the topic at this time.
Source: Dr. Dr. Anas Jain, Head of Orthopedic Surgery, University of New Delhi
Source of the study: Drs. A. N. Raghavan and R. P. Srinivasan, Head and Neck Surgery, Hospital of the University of Delhi
Mental Health Journal
A study of the relationship between medical and physical activity was conducted on 1,859 patients from the University Hospital of New York and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the Hospital of Japan. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group had a high physical activity (e.g., walking, running, cycling, etc.) and the other group had moderate to severe physical activity. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who reported a diagnosis of acute pain of the knee.

Expected Response: recovery from bilateral total knee arthroplasty can be very challenging. those individuals that have gone through it can confirm it first hand. like all things in medicine some people will recover quicker than others. in our practice most people that undergo bilateral tka [total knee arthroplasty] spend some period of time in a rehabilitation center after leaving the inpatient setting. i like to think that people are about 75% recovered at 6 weeks but it often seems like people make continued recovery all the way out to one year following surgery. this seems to hold relatively true for patients following single tka and therefore you can imagine that the recovery process could be even longer and more challenging when both are done at the same time. if you feel like you are making progress each day or week or even each month then you are probably headed to a good long term result. there are certainly times that patients will get discouraged by the challenge of recovery but remember that the overwhelming majority of patients that have the operation experience improvement in pain function and quality of life.

Question: is a blood test for chlamydia accurate?
Baseline Response: yes.
There are other tests that are not accurate.
Answer 2: is there a way to tell if your child is chlamydophili?
Yes.
Your child may have a blood clot in the lower abdomen that can cause chlamydomyolysis.
The clot is not as large as in a blood transfusion.
A blood test is not necessary to determine whether your child has chlamysplastic disease.
If your child's blood test results are not satisfactory, you can call a medical professional for a blood sample.
What is a chlamymelan?
A chlamylean is a small, round, dark green or brown lump with a white, red or black spot on the inside.
Chlamymatospermia (Chlamydopelanosis) is the most common cause of chlamyloma in children.

Expected Response: blood testing for chlamydia? i don't think so. urine and swab testing are the ways to go. .
================================================================================
Question: if a man gets hpv from a woman will he have erectile dysfunction? . i
Baseline Response: it depends on how much he can handle. a man can only handle 3 or 4 of his body parts at a time. a woman can only take 1 or 2 of her body parts. so a man could take 2 or 3 of his own body parts without problem.
Answer 1: A woman can take her own body part and have it taken from her. a male can take his own or his own part of his penis and have that taken from him.
Solution: if you have a man who is very strong, strong, and strong in his body you can take your own part and take it from him and give it to him. If he is weak or weak in his mind, you can give him your body part.

Expected Response: hpv does not cause erectile dysfunction. it can however cause warts (condylmata) on your penis or surrounding genital tissue. if this occurs you could spread hpv to any subsequent partners during unprotected intercourse.

Question: hi my mother 85 y suffer from lumber. s. s she need exercise for her knee kindly advise since she stand (with walker)
Baseline Response: the knees are too short for the knees.
Answer (to the question of the foot): "Well I can walk but I have to do it on my knees."
Answer(to the first question): "Why are you asking that question?"
Answer.

Expected Response: your mother can definitely increase the strength of the muscles that surround and support the knee. the good thing is it doesn't take hours and all of them can be performed at home. 1. sit to stands starting position: sitting with both feet flat and her walker in front of her exercise: slowly and with control come to a standing position finish position: slowly and with control return to the seated position important safety and progression points 1. in the beginning let her use both arms to push up. 2. as she gets stronger and can perform 10 repetitions with little effort have her only use one arm to push up. after that progress to using no arm movement to come to standing 3. once that becomes easy switch chairs. chairs that are lower to the ground are much more difficult to get out off. however when you do this allow her to push off with both arms and progress her through just like you did before. 4. also if loss of balance or dizziness upon standing is a problem make sure someone is standing next to her when she's performing this exercise. 5. start slowly begin with just 3 repetitions and progress to 10. 2. knee extension starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat and a leg weight attached to the ankle exercise: slowly and with control straighten the leg like you were going to kick a ball finish position: slowly lower to the floor and repeat for a total of 10 times. switch the ankle weight to the other side and repeat important safety and progression points 1. with this one its better to start off with a very light weight and progress as needed as sometimes it can bother the knee. 3. hip flexion: starting position: sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat on the floor and the leg weight from the previous exercise lying on the thigh exercise: lift the leg up towards you keeping the knee bent. slowly lower and repeat for a total of 10. switch the weight to the other side and repeat just performing 1 set of 10 repetitions of each of these exercises can make a big difference in her strength and mobility. however it's important that as she gets stronger that you increase the resistance (lower chair or a heavier weight). these exercises should challenge her but not exhaust her. the key is to start small and build from there. as with any new exercise program make sure its ok with her doctor before beginning

Question: what type of physician do i need to see if i have a growth under the skin of my thumb? . it started out as pea size and now is elongated and gets in the way when doing everyday construction. it moves and almost seems like a calcium deposit.
Baseline Response: this is a common problem in the back of the neck and neck area.
Solution: try to see the doctor before you try to fix the problem.
You can try to get the problem checked with your doctor.
Do you have any other tips for doctors?

Expected Response: a dermatologist would be a good choice. their specialty is skin and many of them will do office procedures assuming this growth needs to be removed. many primary care providers will do this too but you will need to talk to your own to see if this is something he or she will see. this can be many things including a retained foreign body (like a splinter).

Question: i think my son took xanax. if i test him how long after could it show? don't want to waste the money if its been to long. i suspect my son taking xanax a week ago. will i be wasting my money on a test if i do a home test now. can he still show positive if he did take xanax after a week?
Baseline Response: yes. The test will be posted to my website. I will contact you if i am able to confirm the test results.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely for xanax to remain in the system after a week. it clears very fast. the real question may be "why did he take xanax? ". many will take this sedative to come down from a different drug that makes them high like methamphetamines. it would not be a waste of money to drug-test your son if you suspect drug use but one negative test does not vindicate him. you may have to randomly test him from time to time to be sure. and make sure he is observed getting the specimen. many teens have some tricks.

Question: can prescribed hydrocortisone valerate be used to clear up poison ivy?
Baseline Response: "Take a nap, take some rest, get a few rest, go to bed.
And if you think you have been poisoned, get help. If you have no symptoms, go home.
But, if you have a strong feeling of intoxication, you can take it on your own.
If you feel that you are not getting any help, it is advisable to call the poison control center.
That's it.
There is no need to worry about the poison. Your doctor will be able

Expected Response: it will help but it will still take a week or so for the rash to completely resolve. treatment or not.

Question: how do i use a metered dose inhaler with a spacer?
Baseline Response: The spacer is a very small and relatively inexpensive tool that can be used to make a quick, simple, and safe inhaler. It is easy to use and it is easy enough to get started with. It can be bought at most drug stores, drug stores that offer these tools, and drug stores with no need for a spacewinder.
The metered dosage of the metered inhaler is 50 milligrams, which is about 1.4 grams of the total dose of the inhaler, and the spacer dose is about 25 milligram.
When using a metering inhaler the spacemeter is not required to be in the right position to be used, so it is not necessary to use a spade.
For some people the metering dose of their metered drug is about 50 millimol or less, which means that when

Expected Response: these are the general steps for using a spacer. be sure to read the instructions that come with yours. they may be slightly different. 1. remove the caps from the metered dose inhaler and spacer. 2. insert the inhaler into the open end of the spacer. 3. shake the inhaler for a few seconds. 4. breathe out completely. 5. place the mouthpiece of the spacer between your teeth. seal your lips tightly around it. 6. press the canister once. 7. breathe in slowly through your mouth for about three to five seconds. if you hear a hornlike sound slow down. this means you are breathing too quickly. 8. hold your breath for at least 10 seconds. 9. if your doctor prescribed more than one puff of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medication wait about one minute and repeat steps 3 through 8. 10. remove the spacer from the inhaler and replace the caps on the inhaler and spacer. 11. gargle and rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.

Question: i am postmenopausal. can i still get pregnant? . i am 53 years old and have not had a period since may 2011.
Baseline Response: no.
I'm not postmenstrual.
It's been 6 years since i had a baby.
My doctor said I should have a baby and said I needed to go to my doctor because I was on the pill for a month.
Since then, i've had a couple of miscarriages.
If you're on the Pill, you're likely to have a miscarriage if you're pregnant.
In this case, my doctor was able to find a doctor who would recommend an IVF method, which I've been using since I was 18.
When i started getting pregnant, my dad told me to get a second opinion and he told me that if I were to have any more babies, he'd have to give me a second chance.
So, I decided to get the second opinion.

Expected Response: you know that's honestly a tricky question. at just over a year since your last period i wouldn't bet the farm that you couldn't get pregnant. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for an opinion. he or she can tell you if you still need to use birth control or if you're probably not ovulating anymore. i would say until you get that expert opinion if you don't want to get pregnant you should use a condom or some other form of birth control. hope this helps!
================================================================================
Question: my boyfriend ejackulated in me four days before my period is it possible i am pregnant?
Baseline Response: you can take your baby to your doctor or even a hospital where they can get you a birth control pill, but you may need to wait until your baby is about six weeks old. The reason why I would rather take a pill than go through with my period was because my boyfriend told me that if I didn't have a baby I wouldn't feel so good about it. I am really excited about my boyfriend's decision.

Expected Response: anytime that you have unprotected sex and are not using any form of contraception you are at risk to getting pregnant. why did you have sex with your boyfriend without a condom? had he worn one you would not be freaking out right now. if you start showing any signs of pregnancy you will need to do a home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an examination.

Question: what tests are done to determine the cause of male infertility?
Baseline Response: A. In most cases, it is very difficult to determine whether a single test or multiple tests can cause the cause.
B. There is no single test that can test for a specific cause of infertility.
C. There are different methods that can be used to determine if a cause of the cause is the cause or the cause itself.
D. There may be no test that is able to determine what causes a certain type of infertility, such as an egg defect.
E. There could be no single tests that can determine if the cause for an infertility is a male or female.
F. There might be no tests that determine if there is a particular type of female infertility, but there are many more factors that could be involved in determining which cause is causing a certain infertility. Therefore, for more information on infertility, see the article, "Fertility Diagnosis and Treatment" (F

Expected Response: identifying the cause of a man's infertility is as much an art as a science. “the first step is an evaluation by a physician specializing in male infertility ” says stephen shaban md a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and microsurgery in raleigh north carolina. experts differ in their approach but here are some of the tests you can expect: sperm and semen analysis. they provide a private room (and magazines). you provide a fresh sample of semen. experts then assess your sperm count their shape movement and other variables. “generally a higher number of normal-shaped sperm means higher fertility ” says shaban. but exceptions are common. many men with low sperm counts or abnormal semen are still fertile. and about 15% of infertile men have normal semen and plenty of normal sperm. surprisingly the complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia) can be a good thing. lawrence ross md president of the american urological association says it might suggest a blockage in the “plumbing” that can be corrected with surgery. physical examination. a thorough physical exam can detect varicocele and give clues to hormone problems. this should ideally be performed by a urologist. hormone evaluation. testosterone and multiple hormones made in the brain control sperm production. however hormones are not the main problem in 97% of infertile men. testicular biopsy. this is done for men with very low or no sperm in their semen. a needle biopsy of the testicle can show whether a man is making healthy sperm. if abundant good sperm are found in the testicle there's likely a blockage somewhere. genetic testing. genetic tests can identify specific obstacles to fertility and problems with sperm. experts differ as to when genetic tests should be done.

Baseline Response: I don't think it's possible, it is very unlikely.
Answer 1: It's possible that it's a combination of a combination and a combination.

Expected Response: most helpful answer hi this piece below has come from this site below <link> healthy bowel habits for children regular bowel movements are important to your child’s health. bowel habits—how often how much and so on—will vary from child to child. some children go more than once a day while others may skip a day or two. you can encourage healthy bowel habits by: eating healthy foods — whole grains fruits and vegetables — and drinking more water each day. children should have no more than 120 ml of 100% fruit juice per day. staying active throughout the day. this will help keep bowels working well. teaching your child not to hold a bowel movement. explaining that regular bowel movements are normal and important for good health. not using negative words like “dirty” or “stinky ” because they can make your child feel self-conscious about going to the toilet. the most common problems with bowel movements are constipation and diarrhea. look as long as it not in his pants i would not worry to much my son done much the same he normally went just as his meal was being put on the table to be honest never gave it a thought do you think your over reacting? fo me its just healthy bowels. good luck

Question: what causes pain nausea and blockage in the colon/abdomen? . i know a college aged person who has been suffering from pain and nausea. the doctors mentioned "appendigitis" (not appendicitis). she was hospitalized for days but then seemed to get better. however she is now having the same symptoms again. she is going to have exploratory surgery. she had a recent colonoscopy which showed no problem. have you heard of appendigitis? no one in the medical profession that i know seems to know what it is. in fact they have never heard of it!
Baseline Response: yes, but i am sure they would have seen it in an outpatient clinic. what is the difference between appendigosis and appendicitomies ? the same one, but the two are different. the "appendicitomie" is a very common and debilitating condition that is very common in the general population.
Answer : "The reason why appendicitum is

Expected Response: appendagitis is basically where fleshy finger shaped growths on the outside of the large intestines called appendages get infected or inflamed. these appendages aren't entirely understood. they may serve as padding in the abdominal cavity but when they are inflamed they can cause trouble. appendagitis is a legitimate medical condition but a gi doctor is more likely to know what it is. the exploratory surgery is probably to find out the size and location of these appendages and possibly to remove them. the colonoscopy could come out normal looking because the appendages are on the outside of the large intestine not the inside. as for your friend's symptoms they all lead to each other. appendagitis could cause all the things you mention.

Question: why should people wash their hands after using the restroom? . my child told me "i wipe with toilet paper not my hand. " i would like a proper medical response to give her so she fully understands instead of me just telling her to do it.
Baseline Response: I understand that a lot of people may not have a sense of the importance of washing hands after use. However, I do not think it's a good idea to do this.
This question was posed by the person who said, "I do wash my hands after I wash my clothes."
The answer is: No, it is not a good thing. I think it is a great idea, and I have already tried several times.
I have also been told that it is important to wash your hands after being exposed to water. However I have not yet tested this. I have to say that I don't think washing your hands is very important, but it is something I am not comfortable with.

Expected Response: it is just not your bottom that has germs. in a bathroom there are diseas-causing germs on every surface (the countertops toilet seat handles etc). while an extremely agile and careful person may not touch their genitals or anal area they do touch surfaces. contaminated hands spread germs to other surfaces and other people. washing hands is the most important and basic of all hygiene practices. only a fool would not wash their hands.

I'm trying to find a doctor or a doctor with experience in this area and i'm so sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
The only thing i can say is im not a doctor and i am not a patient. im a patient and i will not be doing this. i am just trying to get some rest from my migraine and i can't do anything else.
i am so sorry im not able to help you. im not sure what will happen to you or what to do next.
Thank you for the help, i am so very sorry.
Hi, I'm a 46 yr

Expected Response: gotta love a person who admits she has a "short fuse and a hot temper"! i'd suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination. when you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs. this symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a check-up. it might just be that you need to cut back on salt. but it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems (besides your mitral valve regurgitation). it wouldn't be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart you've caught it early. wishing you (and your temper) all the best! sounds like fluid retention. i have the samething all the time nearly.

Question: if prenatal vitamins are extra good for you when you’re pregnant why not take them all the time?

20. Getting perfect
21. Being a good mom

Expected Response: these specially formulated multivitamins are designed to ensure pregnant women get all the extra vitamins and minerals essential for the development of a healthy baby and to meet the increased nutritional needs of mom too. they also benefit women who are trying to become pregnant and new mothers who are breastfeeding. specifically prenatal vitamins deliver a bigger boost of folic acid (between 800 and 1 000 micrograms a day much more than the 400 micrograms a day needed by women of childbearing age) to help prevent neural tube defects and increased iron which helps ward off anemia. they also contain amounts of other vitamins and minerals—including niacin riboflavin thiamin and vitamin c—that may be dangerous. for example vitamins a and d can be harmful when taken in too-large quantities. the rest of us should focus on getting all our nutrients from a rich and varied diet. if you want to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet take a once-daily multivitamin formulated for your age group.

Question: the 4-year-old won't take medicine since we got home from surgery and drank a cup of water. should i take her to the er? . my 3- and 4-year-olds both had their tonsils and adenoids removed yesterday.
Baseline Response: I think we could probably take her at home, but I think she would probably have to have her own medicine. I guess it would be a bit of a gamble.

Expected Response: i have no way of estimating her current level of hydration: --does she have tears? --is the inside of her mouth moist? --is her skin elastic? (pinch a bit of the skin on the back of her hand or tummy pull it up and see if it snaps back). --is she urinating? obviously she needs to drink. and often. did you try popsicles? ice chips? try the little juice box straws. "pay her" in some way for each cup of fluid that she drinks. to make it more interesting pay the 3-year-old too!

Question: since insurance companies can't charge differential pricing wouldn't all fees go up for everyone now?
Baseline Response: The first rule of the market is the rule of law. In the marketplace, if a company is trying to pay a fee to you, they will pay that fee at the time of purchase.
If a company cannot pay a differential pricing fee, then it will be charged at the point of sale, and then you have to pay the difference.
There is a way around this, but I'm not sure how.
In the United States, insurance companies are not required to pay differential pricing to the consumers. In most states, they are required to charge a fee.
I don't think that the market will change that, but it is very important to make sure that insurance companies have the same rules of the marketplace.
When you have a big difference in the price of a product, you have two things to worry about. One is that the cost of insurance is

Expected Response: that's a great question and one many people are concerned with. first there are a few reasons why insurers can still charge higher rates. they can charge an older person up to 3x that of a younger person they can charge up to 50% more if you smoke and they can take into account where you live because medical care costs vary across the country. however the condition of your health cannot influence your costs. the main concern now is whether enough young healthy people will sign up for health insurance through the marketplaces. if they do the expectation is that the market will even out and prices won't spike. if however only older sicker people sign up costs could rise. we won't know for a while how it all turns out.

Question: is it safe for me to have a 6-hour energy drink if i’m on trazodone depakote and celexa?
Baseline Response: It is. I am not sure if it is safe for you, but i'm not sure that i want to have an energy drink that i'm only drinking for a short period of time.
In my experience, the other side of the coin is that you don't have to take a medication or even a prescription for anything that you may be using.
You can take it in a glass of water, or in a drink.
I have taken a few of the other ingredients and they are not safe for my body.
If you feel that you are not taking enough, try to take the right amount of water and try to stop taking it.
There are some other things that you can do to reduce your risk.
1. Keep a note of your health and take the healthiest way possible

Expected Response: without knowing the exact drink that you would like to use it is hard to say whether it would be an issue with the current medications you are taking. you should certainly be careful with energy drinks. they can contain lots of sugars herbals and caffeine. specific products vary so it is important to know the exact ingredients in whatever you’re thinking about taking. in general herbal medications do not work well with the medications you are taking. for the energy you need i would consider replacing energy drinks and supplement usage with sleep exercise and a better diet making sure to take a daily multivitamin as well.

Question: i am a female my boyfriend and i got std testing. my test came back positive and his negative. how is this possible?
Baseline Response: i have a male friend and he tested positive for this and his positive. i am now with my boyfriend who is in a relationship with my brother.
Answer
Answer 1:
Answer 2:
My boyfriend is a transgender man and he is a bit confused about what is going on. he is asking me to go to his house and he wants to know if I am okay with my body. he also wants to see my breasts.

Expected Response: not everyone who is exposed to an infectious disease will get it. and not all tests are 100% accurate. i don't know what kind of std that you have but it would be best for both of you to be treated.
================================================================================
Question: when estimating income for health insurance plans do you use gross income or adjusted gross income?
Baseline Response: I use adjusted gross salary and adjusted gross monthly compensation. I don't use gross monthly wages. I use gross weekly compensation and gross monthly expenses.
How to calculate adjusted gross earnings for health coverage
In order to calculate gross income, you will need to calculate the number of people who will need health coverage. You will also need to determine how many people will be able to pay the cost of a new health insurance plan.
If you want to calculate your adjusted gross hourly earnings, you should use the following formula:
Total Weekly Earnings = (1-Total Weekly Wages) / (1 - Total Weekly Income)
The first two numbers are the number you would use for calculating adjusted gross weekly earnings. The last two numbers indicate the number who will be required to pay for the cost.
When you calculate your gross hourly income, the first number is the number that will

Expected Response: it's your modified adjusted gross income (for most people that's the same as their adjusted gross income) that you'll need to use when applying for insurance. here's where you can find that information on your tax form: if you use form 1040 ez - line 4 form 1040 a - line 22 form 1040 - line 37

Fever

Stomach aches

Bloating

Skin rashes

Anxiety

Nausea

Fatigue

Loss of appetite

Thirst

Muscle weakness

Pillsbury's disease

Dizziness

Weakness

Rash

Oral infection

Gastrointestinal upset

What are the signs of shitting?

The most common signs of a severe shingler are:
, shingle, bluish-purple-colored rash

Expected Response: the symptoms of shingles include: pain or a bruised feeling -- usually on one side of your face or body -- often along with a fever chills headache or upset stomach. tingling itching or prickling skin and an inflamed red skin rash several days later. a group or long strip of small fluid-filled blisters. deep burning searing aching or stabbing pain which may occur once in a while or last a long time.

Question: appendicitis recovery time. inhad a laparoscopic appendectomy in november and i'm still experienceing pain when exercising or stretching out. is this normal?
Baseline Response: not normal.


In addition to my normal medical condition, I have also had a number of other medical issues. I've had a few more minor complications and I'm now in remission.

, i'm now at a point where I'm able to get back to a normal weight. i am still on the same level of normal.

anon141313

Post 6 I am currently on a weight loss program. I have a lot of weight to lose and I want to be able to have a normal life. I'm currently on the verge of losing 5lbs a week. I know this is a huge deal but I have to be careful. I am still having pain and I don't feel like my muscles are functioning normally. I had to use a lot more muscle

Expected Response: i think what you're experiencing is indeed normal. at least if it's absent other signs or symptoms such as a fever. you don't say if you're experiencing pain at the incision sites or in the area where your appendix used to be. either way it's possible some of this pain is due to the development of scar tissue. scar tissue will form wherever healthy tissue was cut. scar tissue is kind of fibrous and can contract which could give you that pain you're experiencing when you try to stretch. the good news is the pain probably will go away eventually. if it's caused by scar tissue this may relax or break down so it's not so tight. if the pain is caused by general post-surgical tissue inflammation that also should calm down as the tissue fully repairs itself. if you experience a fever or any systemic symptoms you should seek medical attention. but if you're just experiencing minor pain you might give it awhile and see if this improves. if not by all means revisit your doctor. wishing you well!

Question: scoliosis in adults. if u had scoliosis as a child and did exercises to help the curvature of the spine can it effect u later in life as an adult? chronic lower back pain?
Baseline Response: yes, the pain can be worse than with the other 2 or 3 conditions, but the pain is still worse than if the person was in a wheelchair or walking.
Answer 2: it is not a problem. it is a symptom. it will be an issue.
The more you take the medicine, the more likely you are to have a problem, which is why you can't have a scolio.

Expected Response: that depends on the degree and location of the curvature(s). since chronic lower back pain is one of the most common adult complaints it may not be related to adolescent scoliosis at all. most scoliosis curves tend to be higher in the thoracic and upper lumbar area.
================================================================================
Question: at what temperature should an adult take a fever reducer?
Baseline Response: It's very important to have an appropriate dose of the fever reductant in order to ensure that the body will get enough of the virus to kill the host. It's important to be able to take a dose of that specific dose to prevent a recurrence of the infection.
If you're concerned about your child's fever reducers, they can be taken to the doctor as soon as possible. If you're worried about your baby's fever, ask your doctor to take your baby to the emergency room immediately.
What are the symptoms of a fever fever reductor?
The symptoms of fever fever are:

a cold or flu

disease (e.g., severe colds, flu)

blood clots

feeling weak

swelling of the eyes or lips

changes in skin color, hair color, or other features

nausea

Expected Response: fever reducers are taken more to make a person comfortable than to reduce a fever. there is no medical reason for the average person to reduce a fever unless they feel bad and are seeking relief. an adult should take a fever reducer when they feel sick enough to need one.

Question: can precum be released via a handjob? . had intercourse with my girl then pulled out before i could ejaculate in her. as we were foolin around she gave me a hand job and some precum fell onher hand then we decided to go for another round. question is it possible that some precum may have remained in urinary tract? and is it possible that she may get pregnant from it?
Baseline Response: yes. the fact that precum is released during intercourse is what makes it possible to make a vaginal ejaculation. This is why you should not use a condom if you are going to make an ejaculation, or if you're going to ejaculate before you ejaculate. If you are not going to do a vaginal orgasm, you need to be aware of the possibility that precuples may be released.

Expected Response: hi ok never heard of condoms? if you masturbated before going to your g/f's and did not urinate then there would still be sperm in your urethra this would then mix with pre-cum and bingo your g/f is pregnant? but that's if the above is correct. if not she could still be pregnant but you will have to wait to see if she miss's her next period but between now and then just think safe sex condoms for now and if she is not pregnant she should think of some kind of bc the pill the ring implant the cap or iud. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: can taking ramipril and avalide damage my kidneys?
Baseline Response: yes, you can.

Expected Response: if you are concerned about your kidneys while taking ramipril and avalide you should talk to your health-care professional. he or she will probably conduct routine blood tests to check your kidney function if there is a concern. we just found out that my husband's kidneys are functioning at only 70% what does this mean. how severe is 70% and what are the treatments for this.

Question: is there any evidence that taking cinnamon supplements and honey have a positive effect on high cholesterol levels?
Baseline Response: No, and not for long.
Is cinnamon a good or bad thing for the heart?
A few studies have shown that cinnamon is a good thing for heart health and it is also a good vitamin for the body. It is thought that cinnamon, when taken for cardiovascular health and increased blood pressure, may lead to improved blood circulation and heart health.
In general, cinnamon is an important component of a healthy diet and is well known to have a beneficial effect on heart health in humans. However, it is not known whether cinnamon is also an antioxidant or a drug.
The reason why cinnamon is so beneficial for the brain is because it is the only natural component in the body that does not contain the chemicals that are known to be associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
What is the exact percentage of cinnamon in the diet?
The average American eats around 4

Expected Response: i was actually able to find some information on cinnamon. it has not been studied in lowering cholesterol so what you have been told is not true.

Question: i had my gallbladder removed however still having severe pain underneath right breast area. pathologic diagnosis: gall bladder cholecystectomy - mild chronic cholecystitis cholesterolosis; negative for dysplasia or malignancy. however i am still experiencing the same level of pain than before my surgery. only difference is that i am no longer feeling that "inflated balloon" feeling right before the pain hits. please help to point me in the right direction.
Baseline Response: yes, there is a small difference between the two. It is a sign of an inflamed balloon. I believe it is a result of the same cause.

Expected Response: so sorry you're experiencing this. a person thinks surgery is going to get rid of the pain and then. nope! one question i would have is: how long ago was your gallbladder surgery? i mean you can experience post-surgical pain in that area for several weeks post-op. if you had the surgery just recently i'd say give it some more time for things to heal inside. if your surgery was some time ago then i would say go back to your doctor. not the surgeon but your primary care provider. tell him or her what's going on. although your gallbladder clearly needed to come out there may be another problem going on that needs to be diagnosed. perhaps your liver is inflamed or something. it's not uncommon for the resolution of one health problem to reveal another. removing your gallbladder may have exposed another health issue that was going undetected because of the gallstone problem. wishing you well!

Question: why am i constantly tired? i don't believe i am sleep-deprived. what can i do to help this? . i am tired all day long every day. getting out of bed in the morning is always a chore no matter how many hrs of sleep i get. i am constantly yawning throughout the day. i could nap at pretty much any time almost anywhere. i have increased my exercise level recently i work full time at a very mentally and physically exhausting place and i am in graduate school full time too. on avg i get about 6 hrs of sleep. however some days i get 5 hrs of sleep and some days i may sleep as many as 10.
Baseline Response: i am aware of the fact that we have a lot of time to go through this process. i think it is because our brains are so busy processing the information we are receiving and processing it in our minds. i mean it is very hard to stop thinking about it and not getting tired. i feel

Expected Response: solved: i was tired mostly because i am depressed. i went on 20mg celexa which almost completely fixed my exhaustion issue. every now and then i will be unexplicably fatigued but it has gotten a lot better.

Question: are there any repellants for bedbugs?
Baseline Response: No. They are harmless to humans, and can be treated with repellent.
How many repellant can you use to treat bedbugs (and how many do you use)?
The best way to determine if you need to use repellents is to see what type of bedbug you are dealing with, and then check with your doctor or health care provider.
If you are going to use an insect repellency, you should take it with you when you go to bed. It is best to take it in the morning, or in the evening.
What are the best bedbug repellations?
There are two types of bedbugs: those that are resistant to insect repelling agents, and those that do not.
Reebomite bedbugs are commonly found in gardens and in the wild. They can be found in various parts of the United States, Canada, and

Expected Response: there is nothing that you can get or spray that will actually repel or make a bedbug decide to stay away from you. you will be far more sucessful in evading bites however if you understand their weakness. bedbugs can not climb slippery surfaces and heat will kill them. you can take advantage of this by applying a lubricant to the legs of your bed or any surface they might climb to get into your bed. also for this to be effective you will have to make sure that there are no bugs currently in your bed. take your pillows blankets bed linins and anything else that is in your bed and dry them on high heat for 45 min or more. then take apart your bed and use a hot steam gun on every crack crevis anywhere you see black dots or clusters of dots (those are bedbug eggs) deep steam every square inch of your mattress and box spring and make sure you hit the crevices and seams real good. then buy a cover that is rated for bed bugs and seal your mattress in that cover to make sure anything that you might of missed can not get out to bite you. dry your bed linings blankets sheets and pillows every day. alochol can kill bed bugs on contact however it will not kill eggs. ultimately you want to eliminate the bed bugs all together it's a considerable amount of work to do this. if you have a place you can stay for at least 3 weeks you can use vapor strips to kill them. close your windows and seal your vents with plastic open anything that is sealed (plastic totes bags of clothes anything that isin't food in your kitchen). the vapor needs to be able to reach everything. then you want to buy vapor strips called nuvua strips that emit a vapor that fills the house and is toxic to bed bugs. open the strips and distribute them through the rooms in your house (make sure you buy enough for adaquate coverage). make sure your heating or air is turned off as well. anything you take with you to the place your staying must be dried in a dryer for 45 min on high heat so you don't contaminate the new place. other objects that you bring should be kept to a minimum as well. dishes or anything you know for sure is bug free is fine to take with you. when you come back 3 weeks later (3 weeks is to make sure any eggs hatch and are killed by the vapor). open the house to let it air out unseal and turn on your air and you should be bug free. however you will want to at this point take all of your laundry to a laundry mat and at least dry everything for good effect. i dealt with bedbugs for a year and a half and they do require drastic measures to eliminate. you won't be able to just spray something and be done with it. if you don't have a place to stay for 3 weeks you can consult an exterminator. we had to go this option. we had to put all of our belongings in a bedroom the exterminator put the vapor strips in that room and sealed it up with plastic to keep the vapor in. then every week for a month he would come a visit with and spray a chemical all over the furniture and the floors that killed anything that was living there. we had to wash and dry all of our laundry put a cover on our mattress and dry our blankets pillows and bed linings every night. also he put a powder called dichatomaus earth (i may of misspelled that) on all the cracks and corners of our house. this powder actually cuts the shell of the bedbug on contact and they will die. at the end of the month of treatments we were able to open the sealed off room and finally return our lives to normal. total cost was about 800. 00 with the exterminator. if we had went with the strip method it would of been closer to 400 or so. i hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck.

Question: what causes your gums to bleed while you’re brushing? what can i do to prevent it? this happens every time i brush.
Baseline Response: I've been brushing my teeth a lot and it's been a very long time since I've had any problems. I've used to brush my teeth and I was able to get rid of some of them, but not much. I'm not sure why.
What can I do to avoid this?
1. I think you're probably already aware that you're not going to be able to brush your teeth. I have my toothbrush and I have a lot of other things I have to brush. I can brush my brush, I can't brush my toothpaste. I don't have to worry about brushing my tooth. I just brush my water bottle and I can use my tooth brush. It's my job to get my teeth cleaned and I just can't. It takes about 10 minutes to brush a toothbrush

Expected Response: the most common form of gingivitis known as plaque-induced gingivitis develops due to plaque adhering to tooth surfaces. this is also the most common form of periodontal disease. in the absence of treatment gingivitis may progress to periodontitis which is a destructive form of periodontal disease. bleeding comes from inflammation. if you are bleeding every time you brush you need to see your dentist immediately.

Question: how can malaria be prevented?
Baseline Response: malaria is not a natural disease, and the symptoms of malaria are not caused by malaria itself. It is caused by the same causes that cause the fever in the human body. The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of malaria. The two diseases are not related. The disease is caused primarily by the presence of parasites, which are not present in the body. It can be cured by a combination of medicines and the use of good, clean water.
The following is a summary of the various remedies for malaria.
1. Cure malaria by avoiding malaria. 2. Avoid all other forms of disease. 3. Avoid contact with mosquitoes. 4. Avoid eating insects. 5. Avoid other foods. 6. Avoid alcohol. 7. Avoid any other food. 8. Avoid tobacco. 9. Avoid smoking. 10. Avoid food. 11. Avoid sexual intercourse. 12. Avoid drugs. 13. Avoid masturbation. 14. Avoid alcoholic drinks

Expected Response: prevention of malaria involves protecting yourself against mosquito bites and taking antimalarial medicines. but public health officials strongly recommend that young children and pregnant women avoid traveling to areas where malaria is common. the most current information about malaria is available from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the world health organization (who). if you are planning international travel you can learn about the risk of malaria in that geographic area and the medicines recommended to prevent infection by contacting: the cdc at its toll-free phone number (1-800-232-4636) or web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm). your doctor or local health department. prevent mosquito bites to prevent mosquito bites follow these guidelines: limit your outdoor activity between dusk and dawn. stay in screened or air-conditioned rooms. wear protective clothing (long pants and long-sleeved shirts). use insect repellent with deet (n n diethylmetatoluamide). the repellent is available in varying strengths up to 100%. in young children use a preparation containing less than 24% strength because too much of the chemical can be absorbed through the skin. use bed nets (mosquito netting) sprayed with or soaked in an insecticide such as permethrin or deltamethrin. use flying-insect spray indoors around sleeping areas. avoid areas where malaria and mosquitoes are present if you are at higher risk (for example if you are pregnant very young or very old). if you use a bed net treated with insecticide and use insect repellents on your clothes you will reduce your risk of becoming infected with malaria. other steps that may be helpful in reducing the risk of malaria include using air conditioning and electric fans wearing protective clothing using aerosol insecticides in your house and taking certain antimalarial medicines. 3 medicines to prevent malaria the selection of medicines to prevent malaria depends on the geographic region where you may be exposed to malaria and your health condition (such as being pregnant being elderly or young being sick or having immunity or resistance to malaria or having allergies or sensitivity to the medicine). if you are going to a location where malaria is present it is very important to take preventive medicines and to follow the correct schedule for taking them. the majority of people who become infected with malaria do not take preventive malaria medicines or do not follow the correct dosing schedule. medicine to prevent malaria is most effective if you take the recommended dosage exactly as prescribed and for the length of time required. if you are to take the medicine once a week take it on the same day of the week each week. upon returning from an area where malaria is present continue the medicine for the recommended length of time to ensure that all parasites have been eliminated from your body. you will need to take the medicine for 1 to 4 weeks after returning. malaria vaccines scientists are studying malaria vaccines to see whether the vaccines are effectively preventing malaria infection. to date there is no strong evidence that these vaccines are effective. 4 3 work continues on improving vaccines for preventing malaria. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does masturbation reduce the chance of prostate cancer?
Baseline Response: not really.
Answer : it can.

Question: i am a 57 yr old woman. is there anything wrong with getting up to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night?
Baseline Response: there is a difference. If you are sleeping in the bathroom, you should be able to go in and out of it. However, if you are doing something that requires you to be very quiet and not to be distracted, you are not going to get the benefits of the bathroom. It is important that you stay awake and be aware of your surroundings.

Expected Response: most adults shouldn’t have to get up more than once a night to urinate. having to get up 2 or 3 times is likely causing you to lose a lot of sleep. for a woman who has already gone through menopause the most common causes of frequent nighttime urination include diabetes and bladder infections. diabetes is often silent and frequent urination may be the only sign that the blood sugar is too high. with a bladder infection you might have other symptoms such as urgency and discomfort. there are also many other possible causes of nightly bathroom trips. it may be as simple as drinking too much fluid in the evening. overactive bladder is another common cause. medicines such as water pills may make you run to the bathroom even if they were taken many hours before. caffeine and alcohol can also cause frequent urination. for some women it may just be force of habit. very rarely it can be the sign of a tumor in the bladder or pelvis. see your doctor and have a checkup. make sure you mention how many times a night you have to go to the bathroom. he or she will likely get a urine test and some lab work to sort things out. then you will finally be able to get a good night’s sleep.

Question: what is boniva injection?
Baseline Response: boniva injector is a common injection procedure used by the medical profession to treat chronic pain. The procedure is commonly performed by using a scalpel, needle, or syringe. The pain is usually milder than the pain of the other side. It is important to note that the pain is not a permanent injury and it can be treated by injection.
Boniva injections are sometimes referred to as "booster injections" because of the presence of blood in the veins. They are often used to treat pain in the back of the head or neck and to reduce the pain.
How to Use Boniva Injector
Bonivavir injections are most commonly used by treating pain in patients who have been treated with chemotherapy. The patient has to be in good physical condition and the injection is made by a doctor. The doctor may be able to determine if the patient has been treated by chemotherapy or other drugs.
When to Use a

Expected Response: boniva injection is a prescription medicine used to treat osteoporosis in women after menopause. ). boniva injection may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most women who receive the injection even though they won't be able to see or feel a difference. boniva injection may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). these effects continue as long as you receive boniva injection. it is important that you receive your boniva injection every three months for as long as your health care provider prescribes it. boniva injection can treat your osteoporosis only if you continue to receive treatment.

Question: are anti-wrinkle products sold over-the-counter effective?
Baseline Response: yes.
This is a very important question. If you are taking anti-winkle products that are sold over the counter and over thecounter for your own personal use, you should be aware that some products are more effective than others. We recommend that you use them on a regular basis.

Expected Response: yes some anti-wrinkle products sold over the counter are effective. the ingredients that make your skin look more beautiful can be expensive but they don't have to be. look for products that contain antioxidant vitamins a (retinol) c and e; scientifically and clinically these antioxidants help stop free-radical damage that leads to fine lines and wrinkles. also ingredients such as matrixyl 3000 a peptide contribute to the production of collagen and elastin. they can plump up the skin matrix and actually make the skin visibly look younger. other ingredients such as licorice extract and niacin can help fight age spots that lead to uneven skin tone. the problem is finding the products that have the above ingredients in the right concentration to produce results. the longstanding results are definitely noticeable. it typically takes at least two to four weeks before you begin to see results so remember to wear sunscreen and start now!
================================================================================
Question: will using an alcohol wipe to clean the test area before blood glucose testing affect the result?
Baseline Response: no. The test is only a means to an end. If you use a blood test to determine your blood glucose, it will not be a substitute for your own blood glucose.
How does a blood glucose test work?
The blood glucose tests are a collection of glucose samples from various sources, and they are used to diagnose, diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions.
What does a test tell me about my health?
A blood glucose blood test is a test that detects blood glucose levels in your blood. It is used to determine if you are currently receiving medications or are experiencing a change in your health.
The test is called a blood-sugar blood test. It can detect blood glucose level and then a glucose-lowering blood test will be used to test your blood-mineral level.
A test that tells you that you are experiencing diabetes,

Expected Response: no. it will not alter the results if you allow the alcohol to dry before you do the finger stick.

Question: what causes parkinsons disease?
Baseline Response: the parksinsons causes an increase in the number of parkinson-associated diseases.
The number of parksinson causes in the United States is increasing rapidly. In the 1950s, the number was about one in 100,000. Today, the average number of children affected by parkinsonic diseases is about one child per 100,00. In 1986, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimated that more than two-thirds of all cancers are caused by parkinins.
In the United Kingdom, parkinsonia is a leading cause of cancer in children aged under two years. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that more children in the UK are at risk of developing parkinsonal cancers than in the rest of the world.
Parkinsonia, or parkinsome syndrome, is the most common cause of parkin-related illness in children. In 1998, the NCA reported that there were

Expected Response: low levels of dopamine a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) involved in controlling movement cause symptoms of parkinson's disease. the shortage of this brain chemical occurs when nerve cells in a part of the brain (substantia nigra) that produces dopamine fail and deteriorate. the exact cause of this deterioration is not known. the links between parkinson's disease and factors such as genetics aging toxins in the environment and free radicals are all under investigation. although these studies are beginning to provide some answers experts do not know the exact cause of the disease. studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a genetic cause of parkinson's disease. only a small percentage of people with parkinson's disease have a parent brother or sister who has the disease; however abnormal genes do seem to be a factor in a few families where early-onset parkinson's disease is common. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: two periods. or one long one. have 20 ys old daughter living with me plus my 11 yr old would that mess mine up? . started period and thought it stopped but yet was spotting lightly. hubby came home we had sex and i started started my period again. does having our 20 yr old daughter living with us now which claims she is not having her period for three months now. would that effect me? plus my 11 yr old is so hormonal lately. she has not started her first period yet. does that matter?
Baseline Response: no, it doesn't. I was just having a "period" and the baby wasn't having it. and her mom is so overstimulated with her hormones. she is so happy to have her baby but she doesn't want to have them.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: while some women claim that other female family members or women living in the same house will tend to "cycle" there is little evidence to support this. don't blame your 20 year old or your hormonal 11 year old for this episode. these things just happen. menstrual cycles have this annoying habit of being wacky from time to time and they tend to straighten out on their own. if not you may need to see a gyn but right now you can probably just "wait and see". i am more concerned with your 20 year old daughter's three month period assuming she is not over-exaggerating. maybe she is the one that needs to see a gyn. yes i agree my 20 yr old should see a gyn but she doesn't want to. she was pregnant early this year but says she miscarrried by her boyfriend hitting her in tummy. as for my 11 yr old. i hope when she finally starts her first period it will make her normal again. lol. she snapped at me and she never done that before. she says she hates me but then she loves me not use to the hormones. miss my little girl. as for my spotting never ending period or two time period not to worry. it is normal?

Question: who is at greatest risk for bipolar disorder?
Baseline Response: It is the people who have been exposed to high doses of a high-risk drug. It is also the people with a history of exposure to high levels of exposure.
The first group of people who are at greatest danger of having bipolar disorder are the people in the highest risk group. The second group of persons who are in the lowest risk group are those who have no history of bipolar disorder.
These people are the ones who have had the most exposure to a high dose of a drug. This is the group of those who are the most exposed.
How does this group of individuals compare with the group in the other groups?
What does this mean for my diagnosis?
This group of bipolar patients is a group of patients who have a history, as a condition, of high levels and exposure to these drugs.
This is a condition where the person is at a significant risk of developing depression.
It is

Expected Response: typically the onset of bipolar disorder occurs in the early 20s. however the first symptoms often unrecognized may occur in early childhood or less commonly as late as the senior years. according the national institute of mental health some 6 million americans are affected with men and women affected equally. some studies suggest a genetic susceptibility.

Question: what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: you are going to have a period of time after the first day, so your period will be over for that period of a year or two. You may have to wait until you get the rh sensitizing, which is around 6 months.
How long does it take for the rh to recover?
How does it feel?
What is the best way to protect your body from the bad rhinitis?
Is there any way to prevent the bad bacteria from coming in contact with your skin?
If so, how do you do it?
The best way is to take a very thin, non-stick, disposable product called a "cleanse". The product contains no harmful bacteria, so you will not get any bad bacteria.
What are the symptoms of bad rhinoitis? How will it affect you?
After the first month, you will feel a little bit more relaxed and

Expected Response: if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant? . we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i don't want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i don't want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he doesn't quit as well. i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker. he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do!
Baseline Response: I am not sure what to say, but i know it is important to him because he has been a good person, he has given me so much love and has given him his heart and he wants to be a good husband, but he is not a good father.
Answer. I do not want to quit because i am not pregnant

Expected Response: i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking! i am a father of a recently born child i was told by the wife and quote if you want to smoke do it outside and so i took my 7 yr old smoking chair and headed for the door she has been a happy woman since. and also i learned 1 thing from it. it is so much more easier to change my bad habits when i know she carried my son for 9 months and still cooked and cleaned. . and every bad habit i have could potentially put my son's health at risk! p. s. tell him to stop being lazy and take his butt outside to smoke his baby cant defend itself!

Question: how is income used to calculate subsidy eligibility in the health insurance exchanges?
Baseline Response: The subsidy program is defined as the portion of the cost of health insurance that is directly attributable to a person's income, including:
The amount of the subsidy.
The portion of income attributable to the person's individual income tax.
Where the amount of a portion of a person tax is not directly attributable, the amount attributable to that person's spouse or common-law partner may be included in the total.
(5) Section 7(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this Act, provides that:
(a) The taxpayer shall not be required to pay a portion or any portion of any portion attributable to any person's taxable income, except as provided in this section, unless such person's personal income tax is included in such person-owned portion of his or her income, or is included under any other provision of this chapter.
In the case of

Expected Response: the formula to find out if you qualify for a subsidy on the health insurance exchanges seems complicated but it is actually quite simple. let’s walk through it. the subsidy calculation is based on your income and the average cost of certain health plans on the exchange. subsidies are only available to those who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (fpl). in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. the amount of subsidy you receive depends upon where your income falls between the 100% and 400% fpl range. for example if your income is 100% fpl you are only responsible for the amount of monthly premiums that equals 2% of your income. anything above that dollar amount is considered your subsidy. below is the chart from 100-400% fpl of how much of your income you will have to pay towards your monthly premiums on the exchange. these percentages of income are not your subsidy; they are your contribution. the subsidy is calculated per individual or family based upon the dollar amount that goes over this contribution. income amount of income responsible for in premiums 100-133% fpl 2% of income 133-150% fpl 3 – 4% of income 150-200% fpl 4 – 6. 3% of income 200-250% fpl 6. 3 – 8. 05% of income 250-300% fpl 8. 05 – 9. 5% of income 300-400% fpl 9. 5% of income also beginning on january 1 2015 if your employer offers health insurance but your portion of the monthly premiums in your employer-based plan cost 9. 5% or more of your income you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange.

Baseline Response: when you need a high blood glucose level.
Answer 1:
Answer 2:
It's important to remember that even if you are experiencing high blood sugar, you are still at risk for high cholesterol. You may experience elevated blood pressure, but it will not affect your cholesterol levels.
If you are at high risk for heart disease, there are other medications that can help lower your risk of high blood cholesterol.
What is high blood volume?
High blood volume is the amount of blood you have to carry when you are exercising. If your blood volume rises, it can be an indication of heart disease.
High volume can be a sign of high cholesterol, but is not necessarily a sign that you have high blood lipids.
When should I call my physician about high cholesterol?
If your doctor thinks you have low cholesterol, call your doctor right away. It may be worth it to call your

Expected Response: if you are diagnosed with high blood pressure it's important to see your doctor on a regular basis. he or she can answer your questions during these visits. however there may be other times when you may need to speak to your doctor sooner. these include if you aren't responding to the prescribed treatment and your blood pressure is still high and if you are having any side effects from the blood pressure medication. if this happens your doctor may wish to adjust the dosage of the medication or put you on another medication.

Question: how to get off suboxone subliginal strips without withdrawl. i take 1-3 8mg suboxone strips a day. ive been taking them for a little over a year and was looking for the best way to get off them.
Baseline Response: not quite sure what to do but i'm taking them daily.

Expected Response: my best advice to speak to your healthcare provider -- the one that prescribes the strips to you. he or she can help you transition off the suboxone. if on the other hand you mean you obtain the strips illicitly and now want to stop using them then i advise you seek addiction counseling. sure you can taper off the suboxone dose on your own successfully but you need to address the underlying reasons why you began using suboxone to begin with. any addiction involves 'environmental' and emotional factors as well as the actual physical addiction. suboxone addiction is becoming a real problem. if this is the situation with you i'm sorry you've found yourself in this predicament. but there is help available. i commend you for getting off this substance. there is no shame in seeking help. wishing you well! the best way the only one that works is to gradually reduce the dose around -25% every 10 days never make a sudden stop or you will feel all the terrible effect of withdrawal! you can read in details the "taper technique" here : <link> good luck and keep in mind : even if you feel well continue to reduce the dose gradually takes you time

Question: is oxybutynin in the family with diazepam?
Baseline Response: the family has a history of diazepams.
Alfred Morris, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is a psychiatrist who has been researching the effects of drugged drugs for over 20 years.
"We do know that the combination of oxybutyrate and benzodiazepines can have negative effects on the nervous system," said Morris, who has studied the effects on rats, mice and humans for nearly 20 years and is now an assistant professor of psychology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "They're not as common as diazepamin."
"In fact, the exact mechanism of action is still unknown," he said.
Morris is the author of four books, including "The Psychology of Narcotics" and "The Neurobiology of Drug Abuse."
He is also a member of the National Institute of Mental Health's National Institute

Expected Response: oxybutynin is a medication used for overactive bladder and urinary tract spasms. it is not in the same class or family as diazepam (benzodiazepine class). they work differently and have different indications.

Baseline Response: Hi,
Hi.
I have been experiencing this for the past 3 weeks. The itching is so bad that my feet and nipples are not getting better. It is so irritating to me that I can't go to the bathroom and wash my feet. I have tried many different ways to get rid of the itching, I have been using a lot of different methods but the most effective one I have found is to just take a bath or shower. I am not sure what you mean by "I have experienced this for 3 weeks now

Expected Response: the most common causes of itchy skin would be soaps detergents fabric softeners and plain 'ol dry skin. try moisturizing those areas use home hydrocortisone cream and consider changing some of the chemical products you are using for laundry or bathing. even if you have been using the same things for a long time.

Baseline Response: I am doing an exercise routine that consists of 5 to 10 mins of low impact training. I would suggest doing it with a normal day of rest between each session.

Question: i recently (2 months ago) had a heart & kidney transplant and would like your opinion as to if i should get a flu shot?
Baseline Response: No, the flu shot does not have any effect on your heart & liver function.


Also, I am a medical doctor and I have not been asked about this issue.

Answer

Expected Response: you should speak to your doctor before getting a flu shot just to be safe. he or she will tell you for sure whether or not to get one. in general it is recommended that people at high risk for complications from the flu (such as those with compromised immune systems) receive the flu vaccine. you cannot get the flu from the vaccine and it's very important people in high risk groups receive this potentially life-saving vaccination. i can tell you that all of the people around you -- family members who live with you or visit regularly caregivers other people you come into contact with on a regular basis -- definitely should get a flu shot. this is to protect you from getting the flu from them. this is very important in your situation so please urge your loved ones to get vaccinated. i wish you all the best!

Question: if caught early can i take steps to prevent bedbugs from multiplying?
Baseline Response: there are two ways to prevent a bedbug from multiplying:
1. Make sure the bed bug is under control (not over the bed) and not in your bedroom (if you're in your living room).
2. Make a note of the time of day and make sure you keep the bedbug on the floor for the time being.
How can I prevent bed bugs from multiplying without having to take steps?
A bedbug infestation is very common in the United States. Most people who get bedbugs get caught late and then get to bed in the morning. If you're lucky, you may get a bed bug infestation from your bed in your bathroom or kitchen.
What are the best ways to get rid of bed bugs in the bedroom?
When you get a Bedbug infested room, you should make sure it's safe to sleep and to not get any food

Expected Response: no. although you may be able to spot and kill a bed bug or two that doesn’t get at the root problem which is the infestation itself. professionals consider bedbugs the single most difficult pest to eliminate. it’s not a do-it-yourself pest.
================================================================================
Question: can abilify strattera celexa or bupropion cause muscle twitches at night when you go to bed?
Baseline Response: yes, but it is not a cause of twitching. If you are in bed with a pillow in your hand, it is very easy to fall asleep and have an uncomfortable night's sleep. The same goes for sleeping with a mattress in your hands.
In fact, sleeping with the pillow in hand can make you sleepy because of the fact that you are very much awake. It is also important to remember that the pillow is not in your mouth, so you will never feel that you need to eat or drink. If the pillow has a lid and you are sleeping in the sleeping bag, it should not be in your nose or mouth. If it does, it will be in the back of your neck.
When you are asleep, try to put the pillow on the bed. This will make it more comfortable for you. If not

Expected Response: there are many possible causes of muscle twitches at night especially when taking a combination of medications like these which can affect your nervous system. if this symptom is new or bothersome you should consult your physician.

Question: what type of anesthetic is used in a cystoscope procedure. i am scheduled to have a cystoscope next month. what type of anesthetic do they use for the procedure and how is it adminestered? . . . . thanks
Baseline Response: I would suggest that you know about cystoscopy. cystoscopic surgery is the most common type of procedure in cystic fibrosis. cystic fibers are small, small, and often very difficult to see. cysts have a very wide surface area. The cysts are not very hard, so they are not as hard as a normal person would expect. The only reason to use a cysts is to make sure that the cyst is not too small and is not a big one. Cysts are very difficult and not very comfortable to use. The most common cyst procedure is to use anesthetic. cytic surgery is a type of cyst surgery. cytoscopy is a cystic surgery

Expected Response: urologists are like chefs. they all "cook" a bit differently. they only thing i can do is try and guess what they may use. if the cystoscopic exam is being done in the office they may only use a topical (lidocaine jelly) inserted in the urethra. if you are going to a surgical center you could either be given an injection of versed for "conscious sedation" or even be put under a more general anesthesia. since i don't know your urologist the reason for the exam or even if you are male or female it would be impossible for me to know exactly what they may or may not use. the best way to find that answer is to call the urologist office and ask. they will tell you.

Question: can lisinopril mix with cialis
Baseline Response: yes
Answer - 1
Answer + 1

Expected Response: this is a good question for your doctor. please don't be embarrassed to ask. any health care professional would be glad you asked before combining these two particular medications. drugs like cialis which are used to treat erectile dysfunction can affect a person's blood pressure. lisinopril is a medication designed to help lower blood pressure. therefore combining these two medications could have unintended consequences. i suggest you speak to your health care provider about taking cialis while you're also taking lisinopril. it may be fine but only your doctor can tell you for sure. wishing you well!

Question: if there a way to get pregnant with a babyboy
Baseline Response: I think you should have a baby boy. I mean, we have some options out there. There are a lot of different options out here. You can have a guy with a different body type. You could have a man with a penis, a woman with a vagina, and a boy with a dick. That's all you have. There's a lot more options out of that. But if you do have a child, then that's what you should do.
I think if you don't have a male body type, then you're going to be a little bit of a dickhead.
You're going, 'Oh, my God, I need to get a penis.'
I mean, I think that's a huge problem.
If you don, then it's not going to work.
But, you know, that's all I'm saying.

Expected Response: if you mean is there a way to make sure my baby is a boy? then no there isn't not yet. the desire to choose the sex of one's baby is something that has been with us for the history of the world but we haven't found a solution yet.

Question: does anyone out there know what sweets syndrome is?
Baseline Response: The term sweets syndrome (also called "soft palate syndrome") is a common cause of obesity and is a term used to describe a condition that is caused by a certain type of food. It is a condition caused by the lack of food in the stomach. The term is used to refer to the condition when you eat too much or you are too hungry.
What is the exact cause of sweets syndrome?
The term sweets is derived from the Latin word for "fetch". It is the root of the Latin phrase for "to grab".
The reason why sweets syndrome can occur is because the food in your stomach is made from foods that are hard to digest and thus hard to eat. For example, if you are eating pasta or pasta sauce, it is hard to swallow. If you are making a sandwich or salad, it's hard to chew.
Why do I need to eat sweets?
It is important

Expected Response: most helpful answer sweet's syndrome (also called sweet syndrome and known medically as "acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis") is a rare skin condition in which a painful bluish-red rash appears usually on just one side of the body along with a fever. most of the time sweet's appears on its own with no known cause. about 2 out of 10 cases may be related to a serious underlying disorder like cancer. the rash of sweet syndrome evolves in a very predictable fashion. it usually starts on the arms back neck or face. the initial bumps are small and red and occur after a fever or upper respiratory infection. this rash quickly grows into clusters of bumps that may measure an inch in diameter. the bumps almost always are painful and may develop blisters. these lesions may clear up on their own but it can take months for this to happen. if you develop this type of rash after a fever or upper respiratory infection you'd be well-advised to consult a doctor. with appropriate treatment the rash of sweet syndrome may clear up within days. i hope this answers your question!

Question: can shrimp and french fries cooked in the same greese cause allergic reaction. hi at the age of 40 i developed an allergie to peanuts and shellfish at the same time. i had the test run they came back negative. so i went to red lobster and two hours later was rushed to the hospital with a shellfish allergie. two weeks later bought a snickers out of a vending machine back to the er.
Baseline Response: yes.
Hi at the old age of 41 i was diagnosed with an allergy to peanuts. i took a small amount of peanuts to the doctor for a test. the doctor said that i had peanut allergy and was not able to eat it. i went back to my old school school and it was a great learning experience.

Expected Response: yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in cross-contamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil. cross-contamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are re-used without cleaning. when eating out at restaurants it’s important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiter/waitress so that the cook/chef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food. even if you don’t think that the food that you’re ordering contains any of your allergens it’s better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents. it will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no cross-contamination. i would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods. in the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an epipen so that you’re able to stop allergic reactions fast any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. best advice: if you're allergic to shellfish never eat somewhere that serves it. lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in snickers. stay far away from things you're allergic to and talk to your doctor about an epi-pen.

Question: is there a chance of me being pregnant? . me and my partner had unprotected sex and he finished in me but 2 days i got my period. after my period we had sex again and it happened again. so i'm not sure if i am. can you help me?
Baseline Response: yes
If you have an abortion or are pregnant, you may want to talk to your doctor.

Expected Response: no. i can't really help you. you are having unprotected sex so it is really only a matter of time before you may become pregnant. granted you are having sex at a time when ovulation is not expected but sperm can remain viable for a week or more in the nurturing environment of the female reproductive tract. if you want to get pregnant then keep having random unprotected sex. if you desire to prevent or delay pregnancy use some effective contraception and you won't always be stressing out over this ever-present possibility.

Baseline Response: yes, it does, but this is a lot worse than that.
If you're a person who's not a virgin, you'll be much less likely to fall in the wrong direction.
However, if you're trying to get your butt to fall, it's very important that you keep your butt straight and not roll off the floor.
It's not necessary to just sit on the floor and lie on the ground with your butt still flat on the bottom.
The problem is that you'll have to make some adjustments to the way your butt is positioned.
A good example would be your butt.
You're on the mat with your head down and your hips bent, and you're lying on your back, so you're leaning forward. Your butt is on the back, and your thighs are outstretched.
This is a good idea

Expected Response: no. a fall on your butt will not cause diverticulitis just a very sore butt.

Question: how can cracked skin at the fingernail tips be helped?
Baseline Response: it's not a big deal. I would recommend using a soft, non-toxic nail polish to make it easier on the skin.
How to Apply
Apply the nail polish in a circular motion over the nail.
Then, slowly rub the nail on the nail, using a finger or a nail polish brush.
The polish will be applied to the nail and then gently rubbed against the nail to make the nail look thicker.
This will create a soft layer of soft, shiny nail polish.
When the nail is dry, it will be lightly brushed against the skin and then the polish will take over and smooth over the skin, making it easier to apply.
Once the nail has been applied, apply the nail as normal.
After the nail was applied, the skin will begin to become soft and smooth.
It will be nice to be able to see your nails and be able

Expected Response: your first step is to maintain good hygiene for your hands. keep your nails clean and dry. file your nails in one direction avoid removing your cuticles or cleaning too deeply under your nails. moisturize your hands with natural almond vitamin e or avocado oil. if you suspect an underlying infection your hands should be evaluated by your physician.

Question: does masturbation reduce the chance of prostate cancer?
Baseline Response: It's not really a matter of whether or not you're a good or bad guy. It's just a matter that the amount of time you spend doing something is decreasing.
The reason that masturbation decreases the risk of prostate cancers is that it's very important to not be too promiscuous, which is very important in terms of your health.
So, if you're not promiscuously engaged, then you're doing something that's not in the public interest.
I'm not saying that masturbation is not a risk factor for prostate cancer. But it does have a huge impact on your risk of cancer.
There's a lot of research that's out there that says that masturbation has an important role in preventing prostate cancer in men.
Now, it's not the only thing that's going to increase your risk.
But it's the one thing that may increase your chance of developing prostate cancer, because it

Expected Response: hi here's a link from webmd it may help you? or not depending on your age. <link> one thing this does not cover and why when men have an ejaculation from sex/love making we also release endorphins around our body's this dopes not happen when masturbating this could be the key behind the problem when masturbating. this last bit is a thought of mine but could well be the reason. so the answer is just give up masturbating and have a lot more sex you just need a good sexual partner don't base this on looks its a high libido you are in need of. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: why would a 13 yr old athletic male have a slow heart rate
Baseline Response: The normal heart rate is around 80 beats per minute. This means that, if the child is in a slow heartbeat, the heart rate should be about 75 beats per second.
This is an important point for anyone who is looking for a quick way to help their child improve their physical and mental health.
If you have been watching your child's physical health, you can see that the heart is not just being slowed. It is also being slowed down. The child is not being kept in a state of high stress.
The child is being kept physically healthy. This is the goal of this study.
How did the heart work?
The heart's work is a key part of the heart's normal operation. This helps to control the heart and ensure that the child's heart rate stays within normal range.
So, when the child gets into a slow-heart state, their heart rate will

Expected Response: there may be two reasons: one reason would be that he is in great shape. runners tend to have slower heart rates (50-60 bpm) so if he is a runner in good shape this could account for a slower and stronger heart rate. unfortunately another reason could be a hidden cardiac problem. i don't know how slow his heart rate is or if his heart rate is regular skipping beats etc so it would be wise for him to have a sports clearance by his medical provider or even a cardiologist. this would be for your son's own protection.

Losses of the hair of your hair or any part of the body
Lymphatic or lopid lymphatic disease, which causes lumps of the skin, including the skin of the penis, or any other part

Expected Response: no single factor is known to cause lupus. research suggests that a combination of genetic hormonal and immune system factors may be behind it. a predisposition to developing the disease appears to be inherited. environmental factors ranging from viral and bacterial infections to severe emotional stress or overexposure to sunlight may play a role in provoking or triggering the disease. certain drugs such as the blood pressure drug hydralazine and the heart rhythm drug procainamide may cause lupus-like symptoms. high estrogen levels resulting from pregnancy estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives may aggravate lupus.

Question: what causes what looks like pin prick sores that itch on extremities and lower abdomen?
Baseline Response: A little bit of this has been said about this subject before. I'd like to note that this is one of the things that I don't think anyone would want to say to a woman who has had her appendix removed, or who has breast cancer. This is something I think should be done because it's just something that people have to deal with.

Question: my period used to be 6 days of bleeding. starting heavy and ending light. now it's only 3 to 4 days. . i had my tubes tied after my last pregnancy and i am 29 years old.
Baseline Response: I was pregnant with my first child and was pregnant at the time I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was in my early 20s and had to have a hysterectomy. My mother was a single mother and my dad was a physician. I went to the local hospital for a hygienist, and my doctor was a nurse, so I was on her side. I also had a lot of complications from my hystric surgery. The doctor told me that I would be treated with a combination of steroids and steroids for the rest of my life, so that's when I went on to have my first baby.

Baseline Response: I am not sure if this is a problem with the labelling on the lab or the other way around. The labelling has been on the left side of the lab for many years now and I believe the lab is using the correct labelling. However, if you are seeing symptoms like this it may be because of a labelling problem or an ocular condition.
Answer - i can tell the lab that this is not a lab problem. The only way to tell if this lab is working properly is to go to your local emergency department.
1. Do you know how to get a lab test kit?
2. Do I have to use a lab kit to do your lab test?
3. How long does it take you

Expected Response: shingles is contagious so there is the potential that you could pass the virus to one of your patients particularly babies and children or adults who have not either had the chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. as long as you have new blisters appearing you are contagious. you should likely avoid contact with patients during this time as it will be difficult to know if they're immune. once all the blisters have crusted over and no new ones are forming you are no longer contagious and can return to normal work duties. you can ask your doctor about antiviral medicines for shingles as that may help shorten the duration so that you can safely return to work sooner.

Question: can a doctor tell if you've had an abortion or been previously pregnant during a vaginal exam for a new pregnancy? . i had an abortion and am now pregnant again. i had it a year ago - i had a surgical abortion and was 11 weeks along. my mother is going with me to my first exam. i don't want her to know. can a doctor tell if i've had an abortion or been pregnant before just by looking and feeling? i didn't have my abortion in the state so i wouldn't think they would have my medical files about it. i plan on telling the doctor later about the abortion but my mom will be with me in the room for the first exam.
Baseline Response: no, i'm not. i'm pregnant, so i can't tell them.

Expected Response: no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it.

Baseline Response: Niacin is a natural substance found in milk and cream. It is derived from milk.
Answer 1: Nica is a protein found in the milk and is used in many other foods.

Expected Response: niacin is a b vitamin and is sometimes used as a prescription medication to treat high cholesterol. it can cause flushing as a side effect which can be bothersome to some people. if you have been prescribed niacin there are formulations that can help prevent flushing. talk to your doctor or pharmacist. also it is sometimes recommended that patients take an aspirin 30 minutes to an hour before taking niacin to avoid the flushing. but i'd need to know why you are taking the niacin to know if this technique is right for you.

Question: will hot baths permanently damage sperm?
Baseline Response: yes. As a result, it is a great idea to have hot baths (see below).
What do I need to know about hot baths?
Hot baths are not considered to be safe in the United States.
Hot Baths are not necessary to maintain a healthy male or female reproductive system.
What is the best way to prevent or control the formation of a sperm bank?
The best way is to remove the sperm bank from the body and replace it with a sperm incubator. This is very easy to do by using a hot bath.
How do I prevent or eliminate a sperm deposit?
As mentioned before, sperm deposits are not allowed in hot baths.
If you remove a sperm egg from a hot tub, it will be removed from the hot tub and replaced with a sterile sterile sperm egg. This will prevent the fertilization of the sperm by the sperm.
When a sperm is deposited in a hot

Expected Response: sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas.

Question: is it safe to take adderall citalopram klonopin and grifulvin together?
Baseline Response: yes.

Expected Response: this combination of medications does not have any drug interactions. however i would take the grifulvin with food to minimize the stomach irritation and with a fatty substance like milk or yogurt. a fatty substance will help to increase the absorption of the medication to effectively treat the condition. do not skip any doses and you may have to complete therapy for 6 weeks in order to eradicate the condition.

Expected Response: many women have sex during their period so it's okay. i am more concerned that you are constantly bleeding on your birth control so a phone call to your medical provider is in order and perhaps a change in your contraceptive.

Question: triple bypass completed 7 months ago need my brother be concerned about exercise increasing my heart rate above 110? . quit smoking before surgery and have lost weight he is 58 and walking every night for 40 minutes and climbing 50 stairs and a hill up and down. he feels fine and does not feel it necessary to stop but someone told him he shouldn't even be mowing a lawn because he has heart disease.
Baseline Response: I am not sure if I would be happier with my life without this lifestyle. I am sure I would not be happier. I have had the best of times and I am now enjoying life with no regrets. I would like to know what is going on in your life and what will you do if you are told you have a heart problem.

Expected Response: i'm glad to hear your brother has quit smoking and is doing so well post-surgery. that is fantastic! exercising after coronary artery bypass surgery is a good way to keep the heart healthy. that said your brother should consult his surgeon for details concerning how much he should be exercising. it's possible he's doing too much. and then again it's possible his doctor wants him doing more than he is. a simple phone call to his surgeon's office will get him the information he needs to keep his ticker in tip-top shape. every heart patient is different and the post-surgery exercise program is unique to the individual. i'm sure the person who told him not to mow the lawn was well-meaning but it's best to get medical advice from a medical professional. wishing your brother well!

Question: could i be pregnant? i havent had my period since jan 2nd. and its march 11th.

Question: is it safe to take take raspberry ketones and saint john's wort together?
Baseline Response: no, it is not safe to drink or have a small amount of raspberry ketone in a glass. This is because, according to some, the holy grail of this herb is to be kept in a small glass jar.
The good news is that it is actually quite safe to consume raspberry ketos in a jar. The bad news is, they can be hard to find. I have found that a good raspberry keto is made by taking some of the ingredients from a food processor and taking it through a blender. The recipe below is for a raspberry ketopo with a small jar of raspberry kettles.
Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour (I use my own)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 large egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 cups all-grain flour
1 tsp baking soda

Expected Response: yes it probably is safe. that said i want to add if you're taking raspberry ketones for weight loss you need to know there is absolutely no scientific evidence (studies) to support the claim that raspberry ketones cause weight reduction in adults. because raspberry ketones aren't well-studied in humans it's impossible to say for certain if the product will negatively interact with st. john's wort. also be sure to read the raspberry ketones label carefully to determine whether or not the supplement contains any other active ingredients. hope this helps!

Question: what should my bedtime be for a good night’s sleep?
Baseline Response: if you can't sleep with your best friend or you're worried about your sleep, don't go to bed with your worst friend. It's best to sleep with a partner who is good at sleep, but you have to be careful.
If you don't have any good sleep, you'll get tired. It will be okay, though.
After you get tired, you can put your pillow down. You can use it to rest or it can be used as a pillow to sleep.
What do you do if you get bored?
When you go to sleep, try to not feel your heart beating or your eyes watering. You may need to stop using your pillow.
It's best not to get angry when you feel your friend's sleep. You might feel like you're getting bored and you're not. You're just not ready for it.
For some people,

Expected Response: i have a formula that people can use. the formula is basically this: take a 90 minute segment and count back five 90 minute segments from when your scheduled wake up time is and that should probably be about when you should go to bed. pick your wakeup time. so let’s say it’s 7:00 am. then we know the average sleep cycle is somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes so you want to count and we know you need about 5 of those. so count backwards for 5 ninety minutes segments from 7:00 am and you’d get i believe it’s 11:30 okay. that’s how you can really tell if you’re refreshed or sleep deprived things of that nature because if you’re not getting that individualized sleep number as it were that’s when you’re going to feel it. there is a myth going on out there that we all need eight hours of sleep and i’m here to tell you that’s absolutely not true. there is no perfect sleep number out there for everyone. everyone’s number is a bit individualized and so what we’ve learned from the data basically is when you wake up and feel refreshed look back and see how many of hours of sleep you got and that’s probably your sleep number.

Question: what kind of food can i eat after a vires. three people in my home had a verse 24 hour stomach. now two days has pass. what can we eat?
Baseline Response: what is the best food to eat after vires 3 days?
The answer to this question is "everything". For example, when you are in a state of extreme poverty, you might eat something like "sausage or steak with a little cheese and gravy" or "eggs with a few egg yolks". The question to be asked is what kind to eat and when to eat it. It is very important to keep this question simple and answer it in a straightforward manner.
Let's look at the basic question: "what kind of foods can i cook after vire 3 days"
You can eat food that you know is good or bad. You can eat foods that you can eat, but they are not the same thing. For example: "chicken and rice

Expected Response: you can basically eat anything you want -- your normal diet (whatever that might be). your body will respond if this "stomach virus" is still rearing its ugly head. for instance if you get nausea or diarrhea (again? ) you may have to eat a bit more reasonably for a few more days. viral infections last about a week but most people feel better on day four.

Baseline Response: i am not sure if i am doing it in 1-2 hours, but i am a virgin and i am enjoying the fact that i have a lot of fun.

Expected Response: first it’s good to be concerned and thoughtful about how you will please your partner – just don’t get too worried about it; approaching it with relaxation and ease is more productive for you. second try practicing edging for a couple of weeks. edging involves masturbating right up until the point of ejaculating then stopping before the ejaculation occurs; letting the urge to ejaculate subside; then masturbating to the edge again; and repeating this over and over without ejaculating for as long as you can – at least half an hour. doing this every day for 2-3 weeks helps many men learn control over their ejaculations when with a partner. it also gives them a sore red penis but using a quality penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) that includes both vitamin e (a natural hydrator) and she abutter (an excellent emollient) can help reduce the soreness.

How do I know if I am not alone?
There are several ways to know if you are alone:
1. You may have difficulty talking to others. This may be because you have been in a relationship for a long time and you

Expected Response: people with bipolar disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that occur in distinct periods called "mood episodes. " an overly joyful or overexcited state is called a manic episode and an extremely sad or hopeless state is called a depressive episode. sometimes a mood episode includes symptoms of both mania and depression. this is called a mixed state. people with bipolar disorder also may be explosive and irritable during a mood episode. extreme changes in energy activity sleep and behavior go along with these changes in mood. it is possible for someone with bipolar disorder to experience a long-lasting period of unstable moods rather than discrete episodes of depression or mania. a person may be having an episode of bipolar disorder if he or she has a number of manic or depressive symptoms for most of the day nearly every day for at least one or two weeks. sometimes symptoms are so severe that the person cannot function normally at work school or home.

Question: how do people get common skin warts?
Baseline Response: There are two methods to prevent common skin problems.
The first is to get a good, clean, natural skin that has been treated with the right kind of care.
There are also some things that you can do to avoid common skin issues.
For example, if you are having a lot of dryness in your skin, you should be sure that you have a good amount of moisture in your face.
To avoid common dryness, you need to get some kind of moisturizer or an over-the-counter moisturizer.
It is important to make sure that the moisturizer is moisturized by a good source of vitamin C.
You also need to use a moisturizer that contains vitamin C, which is an essential ingredient of the skin.
In order to avoid the common dry skin problem, you can always apply a moisturizing product to your skin. But if you have skin that is hard to

Expected Response: if you have any type of skin wart it means that you came in contact with a wart-causing virus sometime in the past. “people get warts from other people with warts. they don't get them from frogs and toads ” says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. “the most common way is direct skin-to-skin contact such as shaking hands with someone who has warts on their hand. you can also get the virus from inanimate objects like towels that have been used by someone with a wart. ” the viruses are more likely to cause warts when they come in contact with skin that is damaged or cut. getting a small scrape or biting fingernails may bring on a wart. similarly cuts and nicks from shaving can provide an avenue for infection.

Expected Response: as much as i would like to help you it is not possible to blindly make a diagnosis over the internet. a medical provider would need to see and feel this lump in order to make an accurate determination. and without a accurate diagnosis it would not be possible to suggest treatments. a few suggestions: first stop messing with it. this could be a deep cyst (sebaceous cyst or cystic acne). by squeezing it you may make it worse or cause an infection. second either see your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist so that you can have an accurate diagnosis. i can't imagine this lesion cannot be treated but you need that all-important diagnosis first.

Question: how is epilepsy treated?
Baseline Response: epilepsy is a type of neuropathy that affects the brain, or the part of the brain that's involved in thought and memory. It's often referred to as "the brain". It's the part that controls our emotions. In the brain there's a lot of stuff going on, but the brain is not really involved. It doesn't make the brain happy or healthy. It makes it sick or sad. It does not make us happy or happy. It also makes us feel bad. So it's a very bad feeling, and sometimes it's not. It can be very bad. It affects our emotional, cognitive, social, and physical functioning. It has a lot to do with the way we feel about things.

Baseline Response: if you are not comfortable drinking or drinking in public, you should not drink.
I have never been able to drink and drink while driving, especially if I was drunk. I am also not very social and I have never had a boyfriend or girlfriend over this.

Baseline Response: I do not have any idea if you would have a miscarriage. I have a 2 week old baby and I am already pregnant. I am not sure if she would have survived the 2 weeks and the 3 weeks. My doctor said it could be a problem with some type of lymphoma or a tumor. I think she is doing well and I think I have my baby.
Answer to question: I have seen this in the past and I have heard that it is possible to bleed for 10 days after you get pregnant.

Question: is it possible to have a false negative blood test for celiac disease?
Baseline Response: The blood test results are not available in the United States. The FDA has not approved the blood test.

Expected Response: yes it is possible. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (blood tests for diagnosing celiac disease) are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a higher rate of false positive tests. there are two recognized reasons for false negative blood tests for celiac disease: patients with deficiency of one type of antibody iga (they are born that way) will have low endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies since they are iga-type antibodies. patients who have self-treated themselves with a gluten-free diet for weeks to months before having these tests done can have abnormal blood tests revert to normal.

Question: i frequenly get blood vesels breaking in my eye causing white area to be bright red what is the cause? . it starts with what looks like a pin hole gets worse and can last over a week.
Baseline Response: it's just a regular old black hole and I'm not sure how it's going to go. I'm a bit scared about it, but it's definitely a scary thing to deal with.

Expected Response: these innocent little red areas are called subconjunctival hemorrhages. they are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels. they appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see. if these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed. blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be straining. straining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement. i saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages. she had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior! people who take aspirin or other blood-thinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages. if you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider.

Question: why isn't a sunscreen that is below an spf 15 very effective?
Baseline Response: because most sunscreen companies have no idea what they are talking about.
A good sunscreen is one that contains all the ingredients needed to make it effective. But if you are using a sunscreen with a spf of 15, it is not a good idea to use one that is too low in SPF.
In fact, most sunscreen manufacturers are still using an average SPF of 15. This is because SPF is the ratio of the amount of the sun's rays that they can absorb.
So, if you get a lot of sun exposure, your SPF should be around 20% of your average.
It is important to note that when you use a sunscreen to protect yourself from the elements, your sunscreen's SPF may be a little higher. This means you will need to adjust your SPFs to get the best protection from the sun.
The best sunscreen that you can use

Expected Response: an spf 15 blocks about 93% that means 7% of the sun's rays are still getting through to your skin. and that if you are using enough product which nobody ever does. so chances are if you are using an spf 15 the way that most people use it you are probably only getting an spf 8 out of it. so the higher spf the better. using plenty of product applying it liberally or generously will really help you as well and going to the lower end products you are really just not getting enough protection.

Baseline Response: Yes, both my kids have red bumps. my daughter has red swollen swollen nipples. my 6 yr old girl has red skin. i know that the same thing happens to both girls, but i am not sure what the cause is. i can only assume that the skin on both girls has been exposed to something that is toxic to both kids

Baseline Response: i'm a man and i think i'm an active and healthy man. but i'm not a man who does this. but if you're worried about not having any cumming while having unprotected sex with a man, do you think you should have sex with him? or is he doing this because he's scared or not?
Reply: i don't think he's a man. and if he's not scared of what he's doing, he's probably not the one who is trying to get

Expected Response: oral contraceptives are very effective but unfortunately not 100%. with that said the chances of you becoming pregnant are small. should you experience any signs or symptoms of pregnancy and/or miss a period you should see take a home pregnancy test and/or see your medical provider. unprotected sex also leaves you vulnerable to a sexually transmitted disease. make 'em use condoms! you are in charge.

Question: why does sugar make me tired? i can have 1 piece of hard candy and 5min. later i get so sleepy. i'm not diabetic. can i change how my body processes sugar?
Baseline Response: i have a special diet that involves eating a little bit of both sucrose and maltodextrin (as opposed to maltodeas and glucose) and drinking a little of water. This is because I'm an athlete. i have been a sports drinker for 8 years, and i drink a lot of water and drink a few things every day. i've been a high energy drinker, and a lot more likely to drink a little more water than I drink alcohol. i like to drink water because it is less salty. i think that if i was to drink more water and drinking more sugar, i'd be much more likely, and maybe even more likely than i am to drink sugar.
Answer, i've never had a problem with sugar, but if i

Expected Response: the body absorbs sugar quickly. that's why people can get a "sugar high" and then crash. you probably just absorb it more quickly than others. instead of trying to get your body to accept sugar why don't you eat more foods that are more likely to give you energy like nuts?

Question: on 40mg lisinopril to get to 120/80. vertigo when standing almost fainting. normal? . hi guys . i have high blood pressure (hbp) normally at 140/120. taking 40mg lisinopril to get down to 120/80. . the problem is i get vertigo when standing. if i do it repeatedly (working on a car/motorcycle) i nearly faint. is this me getting used to the lisinopril. perhaps my body isn't used to dealing with its bp at a normal range. or is there something else going on?
Baseline Response: I have not found any evidence of a genetic cause for vertigo. The only thing i can find is that the hormone lisinobutil is produced by the thyroid gland in the same way as a bovine thyroid gland does. The thyroid gland is the main source of lisin-containing hormone. In this case the hormone is produced

Expected Response: most helpful answer some people do experience vertigo and lightheadedness when taking bp meds. it happens a lot when going from laying to standing or sitting to standing. i recommend getting in these positions slowly and standing still for a few seconds before walking. these symptoms can also mean that your bp is dropping too low. if it continues and happens at other times besides just changing positions call your doctor. your meds may need to be lowered a bit or switched to something else.
================================================================================
Question: if i have medicare and medicaid do i still need to choose a health insurance plan?
Baseline Response: No, because if i want to have health insurance and medicare, i need to have a plan with a "health insurance plan."
If i want a health plan with health insurance, I need to pay for my prescription drugs and have to pay to my Medicare.
If I want a plan without a health care plan, i cannot have my doctor and medicatarian on the same day.
Answer 1: I'm on Medicare, and I have my medicare plan.
I can get paid for my prescriptions and have my prescription pills shipped to my home, but I can't get paid to do my job.
So if I get paid, I can do my work and get paid and have no problems.
Now, if I had a health insurer, I could have a health policy that covered my prescription medications, but it does not cover my prescription drug

Expected Response: no. you're covered and need not take any action.

Baseline Response: i use proactiv daily. i know that it helps with acne but i dont think that it would be a huge help for me.

Expected Response: this sounds like a complex problem. your current treatment regimen sounds appropriate. one issue that may be getting overlooked is your overall hormonal status. changes in your hormones may contribute to adult acne. your physician should evaluate your hormone levels and functioning.
================================================================================
Question: how does arthroscopic surgery help osteoarthritis?
Baseline Response: The arthroscope is the only device that can be used to assess your knee. It is used to determine your ankle joint level, your hip joint level and your ankle's ability to maintain a normal range of motion. It does not evaluate your knee's condition or your ability to walk. It only measures the level of pressure your knee exerts during your walk.
How does arthropod surgery work?
Arthropod surgeons perform a series of tests that allow them to assess the bone density of the joint and determine whether it is strong enough to support the weight of your foot. They then apply a certain amount of force to the joint to determine if it is weak enough. This force is applied to the ligaments of the ankle joint.
Once the ligament is in place the surgeon will examine the joint for any signs of osteoarthropoda. They will then use this information to determine

Expected Response: before going to knee replacement surgery your doctor may recommend arthroscopy. a surgeon will insert a thin scope through a small incision to view the inside of your knee. damaged knee cartilage can be removed (called debridement) and the knee can be cleaned or flushed (lavage or irrigation) to remove loose bone or cartilage pieces that may be causing pain. arthroscopy may provide temporary relief from pain or delay the need for more invasive surgery.

Question: can stressful events (divorce death of a parent etc. ) actually age my skin?
Baseline Response: yes, but I am not sure. I am currently seeing a lot of dermatologists in my area and they have been looking for a solution to this problem. I also do not have a good answer for the question of whether or not I am at risk for skin cancer. I'm not sure what to do with my skin. I don't know how to answer this question because I don�t have a skin cancer diagnosis. My skin is fine and I have no problem with getting rid of it. I would also like to know if I am more likely to develop psoriasis or if my skin is more sensitive.

Expected Response: stress has effects on our skin nails and hair. also if you have an underlying skin condition such as psoriasis eczema or acne stress can make it worse. furthermore stressed facial expressions contribute to expression lines like the 11 wrinkle between your eyebrows and those around your eyes and mouth. learning how to effectively manage stress helps keep your skin looking younger and also you’ll feel better overall.

Baseline Response: no. I have had two testicles, one of which was my father's. i am not sure what causes the other one. the other testicle was my wife's and i am wondering if it is a part of her or something else.

Expected Response: no. sperm containing male and female chromosomes are made in each testicle so you still have a 50% chance of having a boy or girl (unless you adopt a child).

Question: can an eclipse cause any harm on pregnant women and the unborn baby? . i'm five months pregnant and have been running around all day outside getting things done. i was told that the eclipse going on right now can harm my unborn since i didn't wear a safety pin or wear red underwear. i know this sounds silly and i'm so not superstitious but i am worry now.
Baseline Response: yes, but the sun is not going to be visible for any reason and the eclipse will be visible to the naked eye.

Expected Response: yes it is silly. an eclipse cannot hurt you or your unborn baby. you are completely safe even without red underwear (do they even come in maternity sizes? ) or a safety pin. i wouldn't recommend staring into the sun during a solar eclipse however. i love to hear about these folk tales and their origins. i bet this one goes back a hundred years perhaps started by a crafty clothing merchant trying to sell off some excess red underwear inventory.

Question: recently developed some breathing issues and have a soreness of lungsany possibilities. have had sinus infection recently but got over that but about 2 weeks later started having trouble breathing. no cough no injuries
Baseline Response: a very bad cough, but this is a very serious issue. you need to get a couple of days off and be alert to the fact that you might be coughing.
Answer : this is very serious and should be treated with caution. do not allow your mouth to be touched, and if you do touch the mouth, be careful not to fall into a deep snare.
answer: this is VERY serious and if this happens, it is probably the result of a serious infection. if you are not sure what is causing this, consult your doctor.
the best way to prevent this is to do nothing at all. try to go to your doctor and ask for a doctor's appointment. if your doctor refuses to come on your behalf, you will need to have a

Expected Response: i suggest you return to your health care provider for a re-check. you could be experiencing a new illness that's unrelated to the sinus infection. or perhaps it wasn't a sinus infection after all but a virus that has now gone down into your lungs. regardless if you're having trouble breathing it's worth getting checked out. hope this helps!

In general, acne can be diagnosed by looking at your skin. If you have a low-grade acne, it's because it has a very high concentration of the bacteria. It may not have been a problem for a long time.
How do you know if it's acne? I will not be making a statement about acne with a statement like "You must have acne to be acne free."
I'll say that acne is caused not by the body, but by bacteria. These bacteria are not harmful to the skin. They

Expected Response: lemon juice is used to treat acne. lemon juice as it is acidic works as chemical exfolliant. but one must take care if their skin is sensitive. use of dilutted lemon juice with rose water can be applied to acne spot.

Question: does chlorophyl help hair loss and fertility
Baseline Response: It is possible that chlorophyllates, a chemical, can be used to increase the amount of hair loss.
Answer 1: I believe it is possible to increase hair loss in a few steps.
Solution 2: It's possible to make a lot of hair in a short period of time.
It's possible that the combination of chlorophyrate and an enzyme, a vitamin, will be able to make hair that has a greater amount of the hair that it was made from.
So, what can we do to make it more effective?
Solution 3: It depends on your body's needs.
If you have low hair loss, then the enzyme can help the hair to grow faster.
However, if you have high hair loss or high cholesterol, it may not be possible to produce a lot more hair.
As a result, the hair is not as beautiful and it takes longer to grow

Expected Response: there could be a link between chlorophyll usage and hair loss / fertility issues. but the bottom line is that there is no scientific evidence through verifable studies proving that chlorophyll will cause hair growth or impact conception odds. with that said chlorophyll seems to have many possible beneficial properties. it may be a worthwhile time investment to discuss chlorophyll usage with your physician before its purchase and consumption. chlorophyll is found in green leafy vegetables and may be located in liquid form throughout health food stores. many natural medicine proponents claim that chlorophyll is a detox agent effective in heart health and protects against cancer. other claims include improvements in digestion bad breath body odor and gas conditions. specifically mentioned as effective in hormonal balancing according to the encyclopedia of natural medicine women taking chlorophyll experienced correction in conditions such as delayed menstruation and p. m. s. additionally menopause symptoms such as dry skin irritability depression and hair loss also showed improvement. in summary it’s worth some additional research and talking with your doctor about chlorophyll claims. although there is no scientific evidence of chlorophyll causing hair growth or stimulating conception some natural medicine experts cite menstruation improvement and a reduction of hair loss.

Question: what other medical conditions cause high blood pressure? . i am 66 years old female and do not take any medications. i am not overweight. i workout 1 hour 3 days a week. i do not have a family history of high blood presure. i do not smoke or drink. i eat healthy meals and do not overuse salt. i am not under stress. up until this year my bp was 100/60 now it ranges from 100/60 to 140/90. what other medical conditions can cause bp problems?
Baseline Response: the following are some of the conditions that cause high bp in the male:
1. high blood sugar: high blood sugars are a common cause of high bps in the bp.
2. high cholesterol: high cholesterol is a common risk factor for bp and is a cause of the high bpa.
3. high triglyceride: high triglycerides are a cause for high bpas in the pups.

Expected Response: well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the "hypertension threshold " but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise -- that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called "essential hypertension. " although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us.

The fact is, the food we eat is bad for us. It is bad because it is bad. We can't do anything about it. We don't know what it is, but we know what we can do about it and we know that we can make it better.
What I say is that we should not eat food that is bad, that is unhealthy. We should eat food we know is unhealthy and we should eat it if we can.
We should not have to eat food to lose, to eat things

Expected Response: it was charles mayo of the mayo clinic who said "people who keep their teeth live an average of 10 years longer than people who lose their teeth. ” believe it. i have seen it. do whatever you can to keep all of your teeth.

Baseline Response: the answer to this question is: the iron is what you need.
If you are a woman, you need iron because it is the best thing you can do for your health. But if you are over 50, you are not getting enough iron.
The reason for this is that women over 50 are at higher risk of developing obesity and diabetes. You may be at a higher risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other diseases.

Baseline Response: i think i would like to know if it is possible to get a little bit of an ingrowth. i think it is. i hope you can help me.

Expected Response: it's hard to say what this lump is so it's good you're going to the doctor. in the meantime i think i can set your mind at ease that this lump is not a medical emergency and probably isn't anything life-threatening. many conditions can cause the type of lump you describe. my best guess is you'll discover this bump is a dermatofibroma which does indeed contain scar tissue. these bumps often present as a hard lump under the skin that is discolored and sometimes tender to touch. at any rate your health care provider will be able to diagnose this for you and recommend appropriate treatment. wishing you all the best!

Baseline Response: Dr. David H. DeFazio, M.D., Ph.D.
Answer to this question was submitted by a resident of the U.S. who is now in his second year of medical school.

Expected Response: the actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. however prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists neuroradiologists neuropsychologists and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. most of these teams are in large academic medical centers with affiliations to medical schools. the team will tailor the surgery for each child on an individual basis.
================================================================================
Question: how long do sperm live?
Baseline Response: about 6 months.
If you have sperm in your body, you can have 3-6 months of pregnancy.
For some people, the average life expectancy is about 40 years. For others, it's 30 years.
You can have as many as 30 years of pregnancy, but you can't have more than 40 years of a pregnancy. That means that you can only have as much as 4-6 years of an embryo.
So, if you have a baby, you have to have at least 3-4 years of sperm.
Here's what it looks like:
If your body has a lot of sperm, you will have to develop a new type of baby to live.
That means that your body needs to develop more eggs to feed and clot your baby.
Once you have your new baby, there will be more sperm. You will be able to have more eggs.
How long does it take to

Expected Response: it depends where. sperm are estimated to live about one-and-a-half-days in the female vagina after sex but can potentially live in the vagina more than four days. frozen sperm can be thawed after years and still fertilize an egg. sperm ejaculated outside the vagina survive anywhere from minutes to a few hours.

Question: help to stop bf's odor coming from his foreskin? lotrimin scrubbing yeast infection meds arent helping. need answers. my bf has this fishy under from being uncircumcised. he scrubs and cleans and ive even witnessed this. weve tried lotrimin and fluconazole pills and still no luck. not really finding help from doctors or blogs. any advice?
Baseline Response: BFP's foreskin odor is coming from the foreskin. it is a very important part of the body. and we dont want to cause it to be infected. we do want to help people who have a problem with the foreskin to be able to get help. not sure if this is a good idea or not.
I'm sure that bf would want to know about this, but he is not a doctor, so he can't tell me about it. I know that bfc is not an expert in the foreskin, so I'm sure he

Expected Response: bacteria or yeast is usually the underlying cause of odor problems of this nature so your boyfriend needs to be more conscientious about his personal hygiene. pulling back his foreskin often and cleaning the head of the penis thoroughly with good soap and water. if you feel that he has a yeast infection under his foreskin continue to use the lotrimin. remember that hygiene is the key so perhaps cleaning before sexual activity would be appropriate.
================================================================================
Question: i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure. is this linked to menopause?
Baseline Response: i can say that my blood pressure is not affected by my pregnancy. i am not currently undergoing surgery and am in good physical condition. i do not have any problems with my health or my pregnancy at this time. i will be able to continue to have my normal pregnancy until my uterus is removed.
Answer 2: It seems that the pregnancy is the best option for me. I will have a normal pregnancy and I would like to have more children. I am also looking forward to having more children so I can have more control over my life.

Expected Response: there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging.

Question: what's the best skin care for my aging less elastic skin?
Baseline Response: It's a lot of fun. I love having a little bit of time to work out and try out new things. I'm not going to be making skin care videos or talking about the skin care, but I'm going to try out different things to get my skin to feel good.
This is a lot easier said than done, so here's what I did:
I started with a simple primer. I used a lot more of the same ingredients as before, but then I added a little more cream and dried it out. I went for a full-sized product, but that was only because I was getting so many different shades. I was also going to add a little less oil to my primer. It took a little longer to get all the oils, but it's really easy to do. I started with the first primer and tried some of the other products, and I'm glad I

Expected Response: one of the best moisturizing ingredients for aging skin is hyaluronic acid. this is a natural substance produced by the body and it will bind molecules of moisture to your complexion. this is helpful for aging skin because hydration is the key to a soft and supple texture to your skin tone. on top of that focus on drinking water to stay hydrated and improve elasticity in your skin! we agree! our intensive hydration mist has that key ingredient; hyaluronic acid holding 1000 times its weight in water which means your cells will plump up better and your skin will be smoother and fresher looking. also formulated with vitamins a c and e gingko biloba and ginseng this mist sprayed on after moisturizing will do wonders for your skin. similarly powerhouse ingredients in the cellular recovery serum hyaluronate and resveratrol improve moisture binding penetrating deep to help skin at the cellular level. this serum stimulates the new formation of collagen to plump cells and reduces wrinkles. for more information check out www. vivianeskincare. com

Question: is it normal for the side of your face to go numb after having the 2012-2013 flu vaccine? what can be done about it? . i received the flu vaccine on saturday and woke up sunday morning with the right side of my face numb. it feels like you do after getting an injection to have teeth pulled. i have been told that i also have aquired a twitch on that side of my face.
Baseline Response: it's normal for your face and jaw to go flat after a flu shot. However, there is nothing wrong with it. If you get a sore spot in your neck after you get an injection, then you are not getting a flu vaccine. It's normal to have a sore nose after you have an injection.
It's normal that you get your flu shots before you get the flu. If your face has a soreness, then it's not your flu shot, but it is normal that your eyes and lips will be swollen after the flu

Expected Response: well no that's certainly not a normal reaction to receiving a flu shot. however it's possible the two events are unrelated. regardless if the numbness and twitching don't clear up on their own after a few days this is worth getting checked out by a medical professional. a number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. a health care provider can diagnose the problem and get you appropriate treatment. you might consider putting in a call to your primary health care provider for an appointment now because you can always cancel it later if the symptoms go away. unless you're exhibiting signs of a stroke (which would not include muscle twitches) this probably isn't an emergency situation. hope this helps!

Question: do people with schizophrenia have faulty brain chemistry?
Baseline Response: yes, but they do not have the same problem with the normal brain chemistry as people with other mental disorders.

Expected Response: it is likely that an imbalance in the complex interrelated chemical reactions of the brain involving the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate (and possibly others) plays a role in schizophrenia. neurotransmitters are substances that allow brain cells to communicate with one another. basic knowledge about brain chemistry and its link to schizophrenia is expanding rapidly and is a promising area of research.

In order to treat infections, antibiotics must be used for a period of time.
For example, antibiotics can be used to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most common health problems in the world.
According to the

Expected Response: what makes this a particularly unique time in antibiotic resistance is that the pace of development of resistance is really outstripping the development of new drugs. in the past we knew there were new drugs coming on the market -- every year we had something new. now we've reached a situation where that's not the case year to year. for some [germs] that we see a resistance to in hospitals there's nothing coming anytime soon. we're facing a situation now where people are talking about the unavailability of antibiotics to treat common infections.

Expected Response: my mom's cousin says she can no longer taste food because of a side effect of metformin and now weighs less than 100 pounds. have you noticed this in your patients? no loss of taste sensation is not an expected side effect of metformin and i cannot recall any patients i've met with this side effect however it is certainly possible that there are some patients out there with this side effect and if your mom's cousin believes it then it is probably true in her case. naturally there are medical conditions that could cause loss of taste sensation and weight loss independent of diabetes.

Question: can vitamin e help get rid of gentel warts
Baseline Response: I'm not sure how to answer that question. I think the best way to get rid is to take some vitamin E and try to keep it in your diet, but I would recommend taking some vitamin C. There are a few things I would suggest, but the main one is to try to get a few tablets a day and be careful when taking them.
I don't have any problems with the vitamin E I get from my diet. I am taking my Vitamin C daily and have no problems with it. I do have some minor problems with my vitamin E as well. I have been taking it for 6 months now and it seems to be working well. It seems to work for me and my diet and I have no problem with it at all.
If you are taking vitamin E at night, you will see a little bit of a darkening of the skin. It is not as bad as I thought

Expected Response: no. vitamin e would be worthless in treating genital warts. see a medical provider and get them treated properly.

Question: what is the best way to condition my skin before a cosmetic procedure?
Baseline Response: A skin conditioner is a chemical that is used to make skin smoother. It can be a skin condition, a condition with acne, a skin disorder, a genetic condition, or any combination of all of these.
How can I use a skin care product to condition and control my skin?
A cosmetic skin condition is a condition that affects the skin's appearance and function. The condition can affect the way a person looks, the way they feel, the ways they think, the manner in which they dress, or the way in which their hair and makeup are styled.
When it comes to cosmetic skin conditions, it is important to understand the specific ingredients in a product.
In the case of a cosmetic skin disease, there are a number of ingredients that can cause a skin disease.
The first is the product's skin-conditioning ingredient. This ingredient is either a chemical or a

Expected Response: skin preparation is a very important part of many cosmetic procedures. especially in darker skinned patients who may run the risk for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin). your physician may prescribe a combination of topical exfoliating agents along with skin brighteners in order to prepare your skin prior to your cosmetic procedure.

Question: i am 19 and i haven't seen a regular period should i be worried?
Baseline Response: I am 19 in January and I am about to start my first year of university. I am happy with my results but I have to be cautious when it comes to this.
I want to be a good student in my first semester but I am worried about my GPA.
The last time I was worried was when I was in college and the university didn't send me a letter. So I had to go to university.
If I am going to be worried about GPA, I need to be careful about my exams.
My second year has been very stressful. I had the same problem with my class last year. I have always had trouble with my grades.
So I am concerned about my grades because I am so young.
When I was a student in college I always had the question "Why do I have this problem?"
I know that I am not a

Expected Response: worried? no but you should be concerned enough to see a gynecologist to see if a logical reason can be determined.

Question: what is your illness if you have a swollen eye trowing up blood and have 100. 5 fever. the eye is brownish in color has had it for about three days and just resently started trowing up blood
Baseline Response: two or three times a day.
This is the reason why many people with a swollen or irritated eyelid have trouble with sleep.
These problems are caused by the swelling of the eyelid.
If the eyelids are not closed, the eyelashes are exposed to the air and the eyelash becomes inflamed. This is called a "stinging eye."
The eyelashes may also become inflamed or swollen.
When the eyelas are closed, they become swollen. This can

Expected Response: you can't diagnose an illness based on vague symptoms alone but your symptoms are troubling. brownish or yellow eyes could mean jaundice (hepatitis) or other liver problems. throwing up blood can be a very serious sign. it would be in your best interest to see a medical provider as soon as possible.
================================================================================
Question: what's the best over-the-counter treatment for an upset stomach?
Baseline Response: it depends. The most common way to treat an upset gastrointestinal upset is to take a laxative. It is generally a good idea to take it every few days. In my experience, most people who have a sore stomach do so with an over-all medication.
What's the worst over- the-counter medicine for an over the counter upset?
If you take the over-counter medication every day, then you'll find that your stomach will become swollen. When you take it daily, it will become inflamed. If you take a daily over-caffeine, then your stomach is likely to become inflames. If, on the other hand, you take your over-over-counter pill every day for several weeks, then the stomach will swell, causing pain.
If your stomach doesn't swell when you take this over-under medication, then it's probably a good

Expected Response: this is a question that a pharmacist is going to ask that patient a lot of other questions. i need to know who has the upset stomach. and for how long have they had this upset stomach? this could be some occasional heartburn it could be though something much more serious. sometimes upset stomachs can also lead to things like viral infections. so we may not want to necessarily treat it. we want to find out if this is an elderly patient may be they've had it for a long time and there is another medication that could be causing this upset stomach as well. so we are going to have to find a little bit more information. so things like telling us what medications you are taking? are you taking any over-the-counter or herbals because they have a possibility of possibly causing an upset stomach as well finding out if you are running a fever. all these little questions that we are going to ask you are probably going to help us help you better.
================================================================================
Question: i read that pregnant women are at greater risk for food-borne illness. what can i do to protect myself and my baby?
Baseline Response: i know i need to get a checkup to see if i am pregnant or not.
If you are pregnant, you should check with your doctor to see whether you are at risk of foodborne illness, and you should also consider talking to your doctor about your health care options. If you are not sure about your baby's health care, it can be a good idea to talk with your health insurance company or hospital to get advice.
In case you are planning to give birth or need to take medication, you can talk to your insurance company about how much you will be willing to pay for your baby. If your insurance doesn't cover you, you may not be able to get your baby to you.
What are the most important things to know about getting pregnant?
To make sure you have a healthy baby, you need to

Expected Response: everyone's at risk but those at greater risk are infants young children pregnant women and their unborn babies older adults and people with weakened immune systems (for example those with hiv/aids cancer diabetes kidney disease and transplant patients). some people may become ill after ingesting only a few harmful bacteria. others may remain symptom-free after ingesting thousands. to prevent food-borne illness keep these key actions in mind: wash your hands. keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods -- like salads -- separated during preparation. cook foods to the proper temperature by using a food thermometer. refrigerate foods promptly and reheat leftovers to 165 degrees fahrenheit.
================================================================================
Question: being that royal icing is made with raw egg whites is it safe to eat?
Baseline Response: yes, it is. However, the best way to ensure that you are getting your eggs in the correct shape is to keep them on a plate and put them on the table. The best way is to have a piece of parchment paper that has been prepared. Once you have the eggs, you can put them in a cup or the sink.
It is not necessary to keep the eggs in a bowl with a spoon or a bowl of milk.
If you want to make a cake or cake topping, you will need to have prepared your own egg whites. The only way to do this is to make your own butter.
To make your butter, you should use a small bowl or cup and make your egg whites in the same way as you would your butter. For example, to make the butter, add a little butter to a small pan and cook until it is hot. Remove

Expected Response: assuming the eggs are from a reliable and safe source free of salmonella i guess you can say it would be safe. however since there was a recent recall of millions of eggs (due to contamination) you and your guests will always be taking a chance since we never really know when a contamination takes place until we get sick with terrible diarrhea.
================================================================================
Question: can u die if you overdose on blood pressure meds that are not prescribed to you
Baseline Response: they work like a charm. You just take one pill a day and it will work like an charm.

Expected Response: that depends on what blood pressure medication is taken (there are dozen of them) and of course the dosage that is taken.
================================================================================
Question: how do you diagnose hashimoto's hypothyroidism and does this condition have effect on heart disease and osteoporosis?
Baseline Response: it's a combination of all three.
The thyroid is a key component of the thyroid gland, which controls the thyroid hormone. Thyroid glands are located on the back of the head, and are responsible for regulating the blood flow to the body. Thyroxine is a hormone that is produced by the thyroid and is released into the bloodstream. It's produced by thyroid cells that are part of the body's immune system. The body's own thyroid gland releases thyroid hormone, which is a thyroid hormone that helps regulate the blood pressure in the body and regulates the thyroid's immune response.
There are two main types of thyroid hormone: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid stimulating beta (TSB). The thyroid is responsible for releasing thyroid hormone and other hormones into the body through the blood stream. The thyroid hormone is produced from the thyroid

Expected Response: hashimoto's thyroiditis can be diagnosed by biopsy. however clinical history along with a blood test confirming hypothyroidism plus the addition of anti-tpo antibodies and a thyroid scan (if needed) also secures the diagnosis in most cases. treatment involves starting thyroid hormone replacement (synthroid levoxyl) to maintain a thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level within the normal range. if the thyroid is large enough to cause symptoms of compression (difficultly swallowing hoarseness wheezing) surgery to debunk or remove the gland may be considered if the gland dose not shrink on replacement therapy. in regard to your question about heart disease the relationship is more related to replacement therapy of the thyroid hormones than with hashimoto's itself. as the gland starts to lose function hypothyroidism can result. hypothyroidism is treated by replacing the inappropriately low or absent endogenous thyroid hormone with a synthetic equivalent taken daily by mouth (synthroid or levoxyl for example). should a patient receive too much thyroid hormone the high dose can result in palpitations irregular heartbeat and over time a weakened heart. it can also result in osteoporosis. if the hormone is under-replaced it can exacerbate heart failure adversely affect cholesterol levels and slow heart rates down. naturally if hashimoto's resulting in hypothyroidism remains unreplaced completely this can also occur.

Question: i had acl surgery 20 years ago intense rehab. now in winter my knee swells and stiffens. what is going on in my knee? . i live in canada but have been escaping the winter in the past 7 years until this year. after shoveling snow through the winter my knee kept getting stiffer and swelling occurred. difficulty bending the knee getting up or sitting down. it seems cold related but i may be wrong. in the past 2 decades my knee did swell and stiffened after major exertions for a short time but very brief and not as intense as this time. i am presently 47 years of age. sincerely . stephen

I am very happy with my result. i was also given a liver transplant and i am

Expected Response: the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed.

Expected Response: hi if oral sex is the only thing you have had in all that time then no. but stress can do this missing your period that is and the food poisoning would not help this would put you system out of whack then add on the change in your sleeping habits not good for your body. so have we done a test yet either an hpt or get one done at your doctors it would be a good start. but if your that worried do get on some kind of bc but not depo shot just to many bad side effects. but do start getting into some kind of rhythm with your life start getting up early get out and do a good brisk walk with a little jogging keeping healthy is best for you and do get a job easy to say but there is always something out there go look. do hope this helps you. good luck ps is that the only sex you have had in all this time? if your husband is not in the forces then he needs to wake up his sex life its the best thing for you both. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what is the stomach flu?
Baseline Response: the stomach virus (HIV) is a viral infection of the stomach that causes stomach pain. The stomach virus can be found in the blood or in the urine. It can also be found on the skin, in the feces, and in the skin on the face.
How to get it:
To get the stomach viral infection, the person must take a small amount of food from the stomach and wash it with soap and water. If the stomach infection is serious, it is most likely to be an infection of a blood clot.
The blood clot is a small part of the intestines, which are the building blocks of the body's immune system. It is the most important part of a person's body. The blood clot usually starts in the stomach or intestines and can last for years.
HIV is often found in a variety of forms, including the flu, chlamydia, and chlamydiale.

Expected Response: the stomach flu is the informal name for gastrointestinal illnesses caused by any number of different microbes. it has no relation to actual influenza.

Question: can over masturbation cause soreness and a odor on left inner thigh of a male. i am a 34 year old male. i noticed if i masturbate to much right next to my penis and balls i will get a red painful irritation with a bad odor. could this be caused by masturbating to much. i noticed if i don't masturbate after a few days the redness pain and odor go away.
Baseline Response: the cause of the soreness is due to a lack of water or other food.

Expected Response: i think you answered your own question. an old rule in life: if it hurts don't do it. if you have found that the redness and odor is directly related to your masturbation ritual then back off a bit.
================================================================================
Question: is my singular & zyrtec the cause of my high blood pressure?
Baseline Response: I am not sure. My low blood pressure is caused by a number of factors including my body's natural immune system, a number that are usually very difficult to change. It is likely that my low blood bank is an important factor in my high cholesterol.
My low cholesterol is caused not only by my body itself but also by the way my cholesterol is processed. It's also possible that my cholesterol level is actually elevated or is not. The main cause of low cholesterol in the human body is the production of hormones in the body that are not present in the natural body.
There are also some medications that help to decrease cholesterol in a healthy way. However, there is a certain amount of medication that may not work. It may be that a medication is too powerful, or it may be too expensive.
This is why I would strongly recommend that your physician check with you to see if your

Expected Response: that is really up to your doctor to determine but in most cases singular or zyrtec alone will not cause a person to suddenly have high blood pressure. there are usually other factors/causes.

Question: psychological or physiological? every time i eat eggs i get a stomach ache. if the eggs are baked in cookies cakes even meringue i am fine. but if they are just fried or scrambled baked in a quiche or in an omelet my stomach gets super acidic later and i feel nauseous. unable to move for hours. i've had this for as long as i can remember and everyone keeps telling me its psychological but i want to eat eggs they look delicious. so i am certain its an allergy or intolerance. so is it all in my head?
Baseline Response: no. it's just an issue of the amount of eggs in the food. i have had this issue for as many as six weeks now and i'm sure it's something that will be resolved in the future.
I am not sure if this is a problem of the food, but i do feel that i have a lot of anxiety and i need to eat more eggs. i was having this

Expected Response: me too. to make matters worse i have 12 chickens and lots of eggs that i have to give away. like you eggs in other products are just fine but plain eggs are not. many people develop food intolerances. it may not be an allergy but it could be so ask your medical provider to order an egg igg (allergy test). it is not in your head.

Question: implanon expired a month ago can i be pregnant. hey i have had the implanon for 3yrs it was due to be taking out a month ago but i had a issue with my insurance and i still have it in my arm and for about a week now i am experiencing very tender breast i have a increase in thirst i'm tired a lot and i'm making frequent stops to the bathroom and i still have not received my period since last month i took two pregnancy test but they came out neg. is it possibly that i could be pregnant
Baseline Response: I am pregnant and i am very excited about having a baby. I am so excited to have a baby and I have to be in good shape and ready to have the baby. It will be a big day for me and I am sure that I will be able to do it.
Answer- I am on a family emergency and am getting ready for a baby so i am just excited about it. I will get it done

Expected Response: if your implanon has expired you need to be using another form of birth control until you have it replaced with a new one (now called explanon). i don't know if you are pregnant or not but yes the possibility exists since no birth control method other than surgical sterilization and complete abstinence is 100%. see your medical provider or planned parenthood so you can have a more sensitive pregnancy test and examination.

Question: how to know when congestive heart failure is cured? it was caused by pulmonary hypertension. i've still fluid retention. after 10 days of failed lasix dosage has now been increased to total 160 mg lasix a day. beta blocker has my heart rate averaging 80 bpm. my right foot is often ice cold sometimes my whole right leg. my next cardiologist appt is in 2-1/2 weeks.
Baseline Response: if you have a heart problem, do not use any medication. If you have congestive cardiac failure, do NOT use any medications. The only way to avoid a heart attack is to get on a good diet.
I have a very poor heart and I don't like to get heart failure. I have been trying to get a heart transplant and my doctor has told me that it is a very hard decision to take a heart and that I have to have a new heart. I am very concerned about my ability to get my new heart if I get

Expected Response: as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). that’s the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.

Question: what are the symptoms of anxiety?
Baseline Response: I have had anxiety for years now. I have tried to put it behind me and I don't have any problem with it. I am not the type of person who is scared.
If I have any trouble with my anxiety, I will try to get a doctor to help me.
What is your doctor's opinion on the symptoms?
Dr. Tamblyn: It is important to remember that the symptoms can be different.
The first symptom is an increase in the level of the adrenaline in your body.
It can take up to four weeks for your adrenaline to increase.
There is also a short period of time before the first symptom.
When you are experiencing anxiety, you are often thinking about things like:
"What are the things I should do?"
"How do I be able to do this?"
There are also things you should do to help your body cope better.
Dr Tamb

Expected Response: anxiety symptoms may include: agitation. difficulty sleeping. excessive worrying. feeling on alert most of the time. feeling of impending doom. nervousnes. s if you have regular symptoms of anxiety talk to your doctor and get a physical exam. if there is no physical cause for the anxiety your doctor may prescribe medication. or your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist for a psychological evaluation.

Expected Response: if you are taking the over-the-counter product read all directions on the product package before taking this medication. if your doctor has prescribed this medication read the medication guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking ibuprofen and each time you get a refill. if you have any questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. take this medication by mouth usually every 4 to 6 hours with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless your doctor directs you otherwise. do not lie down for at least 10 minutes after taking this drug. if you have stomach upset while taking this medication take it with food milk or an antacid. the dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. to reduce your risk of stomach bleeding and other side effects take this medication at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. do not increase your dose or take this drug more often than directed by your doctor or the package label. for ongoing conditions such as arthritis continue taking this medication as directed by your doctor. when ibuprofen is used by children the dose is based on the child's weight. read the package directions to find the proper dose for your child's weight. consult the pharmacist or doctor if you have questions or if you need help choosing a nonprescription product. for certain conditions (such as arthritis) it may take up to two weeks of taking this drug regularly until you get the full benefit. if you are taking this drug "as needed" (not on a regular schedule) remember that pain medications work best if they are used as the first signs of pain occur. if you wait until the pain has worsened the medication may not work as well. if your condition persists or worsens or if you think you may have a serious medical problem get medical help right away. if you are using the nonprescription product to treat yourself or a child for fever or pain consult the doctor right away if fever worsens or lasts more than 3 days or if pain worsens or lasts more than 10 days.

Question: how can i help research on epilepsy?
Baseline Response: I am currently researching epilepsy and am looking for a researcher who has had their epilepsy taken care of. If you know of someone who can help me find a researcher, please let me know.
I am currently looking for an independent researcher who is willing to share their findings.
If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
This post is sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Expected Response: there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.

Question: can anxiety a side affect to depression?
Baseline Response: yes.
This question is based on the assumption that anxiety is a side effect of depression. This may be true, but anxiety is not always a side-effect. It can be a side problem that is not the result of depression but is a symptom of something else.
The following is a list of things that may cause anxiety.
1. Anxiety is a big problem.
2. You have panic attacks.
3. You feel like you are being watched.
4. You are afraid of being told things.
5. You get depressed.
6. You don't want to be the person you want to become.
7. You think you are an idiot.
8. You forget things. You fall into a deep depression.
9. You go to work.
10. You do not want to play with your friends.
11. You can't talk to yourself.
12

Expected Response: not a side effect per se but a person can have both anxiety and depression.

Expected Response: do not put anything inside the cast. this could irritate the skin with small micro-cuts which can lead to an infection. do not use talc or creams inside a plaster cast. these become gritty when mixed with sweat which could also irritate the skin and cause an allergy or infection. raise your arm or leg up above chest level for about 1 hour. this can help reduce the swelling and cool the area which would decrease the itch. if it is too intense talk with your pharmacist about using an oral antihistamine for the itching. be cautious about drug-drug interactions or drowsiness. if the itching is still too intense check with you doctor about recasting the area.

Question: what are good treatments for rosacea at age 36?
Baseline Response: I think it's the best way to treat rosae, because the rosaceans have so much potential for abuse. I have not tried any treatments for this, but I have tried various treatments. My favorite treatment is the anti-fungal agent (Fungal Antibiotic) and I have found that I have been able to treat my rosaca with this treatment.
Rasaceans are a big part of our family and we all love them. They are a natural part of the ecosystem, so they are essential for our health. I think rosacians are a good option for many other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, and they are also a good way to help reduce the amount of stress that rosacs have.
How do I get rosaces?
How much can I get?
My rosate is 100 times larger than a

Expected Response: your first step is to avoid direct sun exposure alcohol or any other lifestyle factors that may irritate your skin and trigger rosacea outbreaks. there is no cure for rosacea but with treatment you may be able to control the symptoms. antibiotic pills and topical creams may treat symptoms. topical tretinoin compounds and lasers may be used to control refractory rosacea. i have had rosacea since my late 20s (now in my late 30s) here are the tips i've learned: be religious about sunscreen. if i have direct sunlight without sunscreen i will be red for hours experiment and learn which products work best to control your rosacea. everyone is different but once you find stuff stick with it. i've found that baby shampoo as a cleanser while a little drying does the best at controlling my rosacea of all things. i've also found that larenim and pure minerals makeups actually help clear up my rosacea rather than causing more probelms. most of the tips i'd learned when i first got it was about knowing and avoiding triggers. my triggers are sunlight exercise and alcohol.

Question: have copd with recent onset of heavy night sweats. why? . recovering from pneumonia.
Baseline Response: not really. I've been working on it a lot lately, and I've had to deal with it a few times. It's just that my blood is so thick and I don't have a lot of oxygen and I'm sweating so much. I'm going to have to do a lot more testing and I have to get better at this.
I think you can say that it's a case of being in an over-pressure situation. It can be a good thing that the copd is working on the next day and he's doing a lot better than I thought he would be. I can't really say whether or not it's bad for him, but it's not something I'm trying to say.
We've been dealing with this for a while now. I think it's something that I'm hoping to get a lot out of, because it's just

Question: what causes lack of keytones in urine and is it normal
Baseline Response: The urine is a very sensitive and sensitive tissue. It is usually red, swollen, red and swollen in the first few days after it starts to become dry. The urine becomes a little more sensitive to changes in temperature.
The most common cause of urine loss is anemia and kidney stones. If this is the case, you should have a urine exam to check for the presence of electrolyte imbalances. This will help you determine if your urine is having any of the electrolyte imbalance symptoms. If your urine doesn't have any of these symptoms, you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI).
You should also check for a urinary infection (UUS) if your body doesn't respond well to a good urine test. If you have a UTI, you can get a urine test with a normal urinary sample.
If you have an UTI you can do a urine biopsy.

Expected Response: a lack of ketones? you are really not supposed to have any significant ketones in your urine.

Question: what surgery options do i have for prostate cancer advanced or metastatic?
Baseline Response: I would recommend the following options:
1) Cervical cancer

2) Meningioma (prostate cancer)

3) Lymphoma

4) Endometriosis

5) Ovarian cancer
.

If you are planning on undergoing surgery, it is important to consult your physician before taking these options.
 (See my article on the topic of advanced prostate cancer:

http://www.advancedprostatecancer.org/article/5/1/8/

What if I have a prognosis that I do not like?

In general, the more invasive options you have, the less likely it is that you will have to undergo surgery.



The following options are most effective for the advanced prostate.

If your prostate is not very active, you may not have a

Expected Response: surgery to treat prostate cancer is usually reserved for men in good health who are younger than 70 and who choose to have surgery. surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and to slow the growth of cancer. surgery choices radical prostatectomy the removal of the prostate and its cancer. it is not usually done if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. orchiectomy the removal of the testicles. this may cause the cancer to shrink and may improve symptoms because prostate cancer often needs the testosterone made by the testicles to grow. turp or transurethral resection of the prostate. this operation can help to relieve bladder problems because it removes part of the tumor that may be blocking the urethra the tube that carries urine from your bladder through your penis. this can keep the tumor from growing for a while. but turp does not take out the whole tumor. what to think about a study suggests that advanced prostate cancer can sometimes be cured if the cancer has spread to only a few lymph nodes and great care is used to completely remove the lymph nodes during prostatectomy. 14 radiation and hormone treatment may be used afterwards to destroy any remaining cancer cells. surgical removal of the testicles ( orchiectomy ) and hormone therapy medicines have some of the same side effects including hot flashes larger breasts loss of sexual desire and the inability to have an erection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does lipitor cause pancreatic cancer. i have read recently that lipitor may be linked to pancreatic cancer. can you verify if there's any studies to support that? there is pancreatic cancer in my immediate family and i am presently taking lipitor. thanks.
Baseline Response: i do not have any pancreatic cancers. my family has a small family of four children and i have seen no benefit to my family. i am currently on the waiting list for a transplant, my family is on waiting list and i need to see a doctor to determine if i need a transplant. i would recommend to do the same to my own family. if you have any questions or comments please email me at [email protected]
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i don't think that anyone knows for sure at this point. pancreatic cancer has been around a long time before lipitor and most people who have pancreatic cancer have never used it. keep abreast of any new information that may surface on the medical sites but an "association" is not necessarily a "cause". you could easily make an association that people who eat at a certain fast food chain have a higher level of a disease than someone who doesn't or that a large percentage of people who have a type of cancer had driven a car prior to the diagnosis. these are "associations". if any definitive studies are found with a causative relationship any suspect drug is immediately pulled from the market.

Expected Response: there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: is pregnancy possible if you start a period 19 hours after sex? bearing in mind that the period was about a week early. i had unprotected sex at around 5am on january 1st. around 11pm the same day i started to bleed lightly (light pink). it continued on and off until the third and didn't become heavier. it's been accompanied by some light cramps but nothing i'd really worry about. the last time i was pregnant i also had a very heavy period and was still found to be <negative_smiley>9 weeks pregnant so i'm just being cautious this time.
Baseline Response: it's not a problem, it's a condition that may or may not be present. you could have a period that lasted for around 3-4 weeks before you started to feel any pain, or it may be caused by a specific hormone or an abnormal way of doing things. if you are having a hard time getting your period off, try a menstrual period that

Expected Response: in the world of conception just about anything is possible when you are havinig unprotected sex. if this is truly your normal period it certainly would be less likely to be ovulating a day before. because of your prior pregnancy experience i can understand your concern. you are wise to be cautious. and it is okay to continue to worry a bit until you have a negative pregnancy test or another normal period.

Question: my son got sand thrown in his eye and it is swollen. we did rinse it out with water. what is the next step?
Baseline Response: We will have to see if it is a serious problem.
In this case, I can't say what the treatment is for, but it's a good idea.
We will be able to use a couple of drops of water and a couple drops of soap to get a little bit of the oil.
I am afraid that I can not use any of the soap to clean it up, because it will only work for a couple days.
This is what I am going to do now:
I will start with a bit of sand and a bit more sand, and then I will start using a bit and a half of water.
Then I will use a bit, and a little more water, and I will stop using sand.
The first step is to remove the sand from the eye, and the second step

Expected Response: ahhh. sandbox eyes. i see this quite often. the next step assuming he is still crying rubbing his eyes and complaining is to see a medical provider to see if he has a corneal abrasion - a painful scratch on the cornea. you will need to take him to an urgent care facility. the medical provider will put a drop or two of an anesthetic solution to numb the eye (instant relief! ). a tiny amount of bright-yellow fluorecein dye will be put in the eye to reveal any scratch. it can be seen using a "black light" in a darkened examination room. if he does have a tiny scratch he will need some antibiotic drops or ointment for a few days while it heals. these things are painful but fortunately they heal very fast.

Question: is there any long term side effects from childrens zyrtec?
Baseline Response: yes.
For example, if you are young, you might get a little soreness and you might not get better. You will have to adjust your daily diet and exercise regimen to keep up with your body's needs. It is important that you understand the difference between healthy eating and unhealthy eating.
When you're young, the difference is that you might have a little bit more of a chance to have an orgasm.
Your body is not the only one that may have a problem. It can also be the cause of some illnesses.
How does the body cope with the stress of eating?
You can be a bit more self conscious and be more mindful of your own body. If you are feeling stressed or stressed out, you will notice that your body is more sensitive to stress.
What is the cause for your body to be stressed?

Question: can i mix magnesium citrate with tea to make it not taste as bad?
Baseline Response: I have not seen a recipe for this, but it's probably the best I've ever found. It's a good addition to the tea, but doesn't really help it in the way of flavor or taste. I have used it with some other teas, but the results have been nothing but a bit bland.
Answer. I do think that you need to try this tea for a couple of days, but I think it would be a good idea to try it again.
I think that the best way to go about doing this is to use it as a light or medium weight tea. It seems to work great with most tea. I think you could use it in tea bags to make a small cup of tea and then add it to a tea kettle. This is more like a regular tea bag than a tea box.
There are also recipes that make it into a small

Expected Response: i don't think it will matter or change the effectiveness. you can probably mix it with just about anything but it still may not be very palatable. it will likely make you tea taste yucky too.

Question: will you be able to get frost bite exposing your hands for 10 minutes in 30 degrees. a friend of mine said that she was driving a person home who did not want the defroster on in the car so in order to have the window defrosted she had to put the windows down for less than 10 minutes. the temperature outside was 35 degrees so is it possible for this person to get frost bite?
Baseline Response: yes, but the defrosting is done with a small amount of water.
You are not going to see a frost bite exposed.
Now the picture above shows how it looks from the outside:
The first picture shows the defrester window defrosters, it has a little hole in the middle, with a little piece of wood on top. The second picture shows a little bit of the window that is going to be defrost in the window, and then the defrester window defresters. The third picture shows what the window

Expected Response: it's certainly not likely. frostbite is the term we use when our body's tissue literally freezes. as you can imagine this process can take quite some time. commonly frostbite occurs when bare skin is exposed to sub-freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time. the process can occur faster if the bare skin is for example engulfed in snow or ice. and covered tissue (like skin fingers toes etc. ) isn't protected from frostbite either. many people have had their toes frozen by standing in knee-deep snow for hours even while wearing heavy boots. driving with the car windows down for 10 minutes in 35-degree weather isn't likely to produce frostbite. even if it did it would probably only produce a very mild case involving a few skin layers. hope this answers your question!

Question: i have dark purple blotches under my eyes even though i'm healthy. what causes it?
Baseline Response: ( i think i have the same problem)
Question - how do you get dark skin on your skin ?

Question: what are some of the symptoms of pregnancy?
Baseline Response: The first thing you'll notice about pregnancy is that the uterus is almost always very large. It is very, very hard to see. You can see it, but it's hard to feel it. If you are pregnant, you'll have a very small vagina, which is very hard and very hard for a woman to feel.
But if you have a large vagina, it's easier to see and feel. If it's not, you won't be able to feel anything. But if it's there, it will help you to feel better.
In fact, a lot of women have experienced this with a small vagina.
I had a guy who was pregnant. He told me he had a large uterus. He said, "Well, it looks like a vagina, but I can't see it. I can only see my vagina." He said he didn't want to talk about it because he didn. He

Expected Response: one of the first pregnancy symptoms you may notice is that your period does not arrive. while this symptom is one we most commonly associate with pregnancy there may be other reasons why a period hasn’t arrived for example high levels of stress major illness or surgery. another well known pregnancy symptom is morning sickness. morning sickness can pay you a visit any time of day so make sure you eat enough and avoid letting your blood sugar levels drop. ginger is a great natural remedy for nausea so it’s worth a try although some women find that nothing seems to help their morning sickness which normally hangs around for the first trimester before getting better or if you are unlucky the second trimester or even whole pregnancy. for more details click on early pregnancy symptoms

Baseline Response: I don't know why it is called an ichy, but it is an ichi, and that's why it's called an ochi. It's a baby.
If you have a lump on your leg, or if you have any other ichie on your body, you should know that it can be a sign of infection. If you have an ikie on the back of your leg or on your belly, you may have a ichia in your leg and it's not ichi. You can also have ichies on your knees.
A baby's ichiew is a condition that occurs when the ichis is very large or when it is very thin or when the

Expected Response: your description is really not sufficient for me to even make a wild guess. i don't know your baby's age or the location of these lumps and obviously i have no way of feeling/examining them to give you a definitive answer. any chance that they are related to the vaccine administrations (on the upper thigh area). children often bleed a tiny bit under the skin from the injection. this area can form a tiny innocent lump that can take a while to self-resolve.

Question: is cancer a virus or bacteria?
Baseline Response: cancer is a bacterial disease caused by a specific cancer cell. It's a common condition that can cause cancer.
What are the symptoms?
The first symptom is a very short, flat, and round discoloration on the side of the head.

My boyfriend is also a big fan of our team. He says he's been having a "bizarre" birth and that he's excited to have a baby with our team, but he's also worried about the future. I'm not sure why this is happening, but it's probably because my boyfriend and I are planning to have an ultrasound at the end of May.

Expected Response: hi so who do you trust your b/f or your doctors? but after that it would all be down to blood tests its the only way your ever find out who is the real father. if your b/f is saying he is the real father i would just let it stay that way and forget the blood tests. your call. good luck

Question: how soon after taking 1-day vaginal medicine for yeast infections can you pee without losing what's inside?
Baseline Response: when you pee, your peeing body is about to explode, so peeing is a good time to take it off. When you pee and your body's temperature is low, your body is going to be able to get rid of the yeast infection and stop the yeast from spreading.
When your body gets a little cold, you may need to pee and urinate. If you can't pee and you still want to pee, then your pee should be dry.
How long should I wait to pee?
If you wait more than 2-3 days for your urine to get dry, you should get a positive test. If the test is negative, you have to wait until your next urine test to see if the yeast is still there.
I don't have any yeast infections, can I take it?
No. There's no way to get

Expected Response: that is a personal skill that i really can't help you with very much. in most cases a vaginal suppository or cream should not be expelled when you urinate. a woman has gotta pee you know.

Does it hurt to go to bed early every morning and wake up at 3 am?
Is it possible to prevent your baby from being born at home when eczery is not normal?

Expected Response: be sure baby's nails are trimmed often and then take the edge off of them with a file if you can. some parents also slip "scratch mittens" onto their little one's hands. others try long socks tucked in under a long-sleeved shirt so they're harder for baby to remove. other things you can do to treat baby's eczema at home include: bathe baby for no more than 10 minutes in warm water. hot water can strip skin of its natural protective oils. use mild unscented body and laundry soaps. use soap only where baby may be dirty such as the genitals and hands and feet. simply rinse off the rest of baby's body. pat baby's skin dry; don't rub. apply a moisturizer while baby's skin is wet. oatmeal soaking products added to baby's tub may make your little one's skin less itchy. talk to your doctor.

Question: can a male contact bacteria vaginosis from one woman and pass it on to another woman?
Baseline Response: yes, but it is only possible if the female is infected with it.
The other way is to use a virus that is contaminated with bacteria. It is not necessary to use any virus, just a virus.
A virus can be contaminated by a virus in a way that is not present in the body. In this case, the virus must be present in a tissue that is normally present in this person.
When a virus is present in one person, it is usually present in another person. It can be present when there is a strong and persistent infection.
What is the risk of contracting an infection if there is no infection in a person who has not been infected with the virus?
The risk of having an infection in the person who was infected with HIV is one in ten, or one in five, which is 1.5 times higher than the risk in

Expected Response: that is difficult to say but at least some of the tamiflu may have been absorbed. you are probably taking tamiful twice per day for five days so you can wait until the next dose is due. hopefully you will not vomit this one. i do not feel that taking an extra dose now would be prudent. if for some reason that you vomit again you need to consult your treating medical provider.

Question: does vela smooth really get rid of cellulite if so won't it also work on the fat under my chin my double chin?
Baseline Response: I don't think so. I think it gets rid of the cellulite in the fat that is under my skin and I think that it will do that. If you look at my photos I have a really large face and it is a huge face. If it doesn't get rid off then you can see that it's going to take a while. I do like to think that if you look closely then you will see that the cellulites are going to be in the way. I will say that if I look at them in my photos there is no cellulite, no wrinkles or any of that. It just doesn't look like a lot of cellulites.
This is an issue for me and it has been something that I have been thinking about for a long time. I have seen that there is a lot going on with

Expected Response: there is no treatment that i have seen that eliminates on a permanent basis cellulite. so there isn't anything that i recommend for my patients to get rid of cellulite that i think is worth spending money on. that i have seen so far. it will help reduce the appearance of cellulite on a temporary basis but it does take several treatments and those treatments have to be maintained over time. so if that's something that fits into your budget and into your time frame then i don't have any objections to it in terms of safety. however it will not eliminate cellulite.

Question: how does one go about getting a health insurance plan from the marketplaces?
Baseline Response: It's a lot like the health insurance marketplace. You can buy health insurance, and you can buy a car, but you don't have the insurance. You need to get the insurance to buy the insurance, but if you don, you can't get the health plan. So, you have to get a policy to get your insurance, you need to buy it, you get a lot of coverage. But, in the case of the health exchanges, you are going to get more coverage than you're going to have coverage. So you're not going to be able to get coverage in the marketplace.
In other words, it is a lot more difficult to get insurance.
What about in-person health insurance?
You can get it in person, but it's not going for you in the marketplace. In the case, you're still going to need to go to the marketplace

I've never been in any trouble with oil pulling. I mean, I'm sure you've seen some people say they've been in trouble with this for a while now and that it's not like it's all just about oil pulling, but I've seen people say that it is.
So I've talked to a lot people who have experienced it and they've said that it has nothing to do with oil. It's just that they

Question: my primary doctor diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed xanax and zoloft. why do i still have panic attacks?
Baseline Response: i just have a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. i'm trying to be a better person. i didn't know that it was possible to go through this and still have anxiety. i had to go to a doctor. and i'm just starting to get into it. i think that's why i still feel anxious.
Answer
Answer : my doctor prescribed xanthine and xanamid. i did not know that xan amid was a good thing. i thought that was because i was afraid of xan. but i was wrong. i was scared of xanthin, but i didn' t know it was a bad thing. and it was bad for me. and that was my primary cause of panic attacks and panic attack. i have been in this situation before and i had never had any panic attacks,

Expected Response: i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing "bridge therapy" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!

Question: why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking. no phlem. wakes me up at night. night and morning only.
Baseline Response: I just can't get my morning cough to stop.

Expected Response: good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!

Question: can shingles appear in the mouth or throat
Baseline Response: The mouth is the part of the brain that is the most sensitive to pain. The throat is the area that is most sensitive. The brain is the region that is least sensitive.
Shingles are different from other types of cancer. Shingles in the throat are a result of an allergic reaction to some medicines or an infection. If you have shingled, you may have a mild or severe allergic reaction.
Some people who have shedles will have a disease called eczema. This is a condition where a doctor or nurse tries to fix the condition by telling the person to stop using the medicines and go to the doctor. If the person stops using the medicine, the eczemesis will stop.
It is possible that someone who has shedled may be allergic to certain medicines. It is important to know if your doctor or doctor is taking medicine that has been given to you.

Expected Response: shingles or herpes zoster is caused by the chicken pox virus. once you have had chicken pox the virus remains dormant in your body. when this virus reawakens it causes a blistering rash called shingles. if shingles affects the trigeminal nerve on the face it can cause sores to appear on one side of the mouth tongue and palate. other viruses including herpes can also cause blisters around the mouth. click on this link for more information about shingles. <link>

Question: can oral sex combined with kissing possibly result in pregnancy? . recently (a few weeks ago) my girlfriend performed oral sex on me and swallowed. we made out (the taste of semen was present in her mouth) and then i performed oral sex on her without thinking that i could have sperm present in my mouth. her period is now somewhat late in coming so we are both worried that she might have gotten pregnant. i know that there is at least a small chance of it but could she have feasibly gotten pregnant from this scenario?
Baseline Response: yes
Answer #2: If you have a child who has not been circumcised and is not currently in your family, you should not have sex with your partner. I know this has been said before, but it is not accepted. It is still a very serious issue. I don't think that people should have sex unless they are not circumcised. If they are, I don' think they should have any difficulty in doing so.

Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely that pregnancy could occur from the scenerio that you described. there are many things that cause a delay in the menses including stress. because you both are engaging in intimate sexual activity it may only be a matter of time before you both decide to go the rest of the way and have vaginal sex. i would strongly suggest that you use condoms and that your girlfriend be on another form of effective birth control.

Question: is it common to for the pain of plantar fasciitis to increase after completing the strectch exercises?
Baseline Response: it is common to decrease the pain in a plantar (incline) condition by a few weeks. The most common pain is pain of the head, where it has been caused by the stress of the exercise.
If you have had plantar fascia (spinal pain) for the past few years, you may have a plantarian strain (spine) that you have not experienced. If you have a spiny plantar plantar disease (spinus or scoliosis), the plantar symptoms may be caused by a plant tissue infection. The symptoms of spinus and scolii are often different, and may include:

Painful growth in the lower back.

Spinal pain in the upper back. (See above for more information.)

Distorted pain in an area of the upper spine.

Expected Response: not sure what the answer is but try to roll your foot on an icecold can of pop or the like; back and forth gently rolling. helped me quite a bit.

Question: can a cat puncture wound cause cellulitis. can a cat nail puncture wound cause cellulitis
Baseline Response: no, but it's possible. It's not a disease, and it can happen.
Answer - a cat may be able to nail a wound, but that can be a very serious injury.
How can a person with cellulitis get into a dog?
Answer- if you can't find a vet, you may not be able.
Can dogs bite?

Expected Response: most definitely. cats cause more intentional infections like cellulitis than just about any domestic animal since they tend to walk around in their cat boxes and have claws like needles that can cause deeper wound infections.

Question: i have gerd and take prevacid. my symptoms have exacerbated since taking a vitamin d prescription. is that common?
Baseline Response: no, but i have no idea. i am not taking vitamin d, just taking one.
Answer to this question is the same as the one above:
Answer (2):
1) This is what is going on in your body.
2) If you do not have a vitamin D supplement, please don't take it.
3) If i do not take it, please do not stop taking it. i just did not know if it was the vitamin D or not.
4) If im not sure if i am taking vitamin D, im sure that i am.
5) If it is not the vitamin d supplement that i was looking for, i would advise you to stop taking vitamin c.
6) If your body is not producing enough vitamin D and you do have any other problems, i recommend taking a

Expected Response: this is actually not common. i looked at the literature to see if there was any type of drug interaction and there is not. i would advise calling your health-care provider and letting them know that you are experiencing symptoms of gerd they may want to see you to re-evaluate. they may order a blood test to see what your level of vitamin d is.

Question: can a prescribed steroid to eliminate a cough damage the pancreas and cause related symptoms? . from nov-dec had a cold with cough that didn't want to leave. i took a prescribed steroid a few days then some digestive problems slowly develop in january. dull pain left side won't stop. i've had several scans scopes up/down blood tests - all normal! so tired of this dull pain belching strange tiny bumps on my skin on my abdomen and back tired/fatigue feeling. no diarrhea or vomiting at all. no jaundice but eyes often hurt especially skin just below eyes feel like a sunburn. pre-canc?
Baseline Response: the pancresa is a small, large, delicate gland called the pancreatic gland. The pancrea is part of the pancrotic system, which is located in the back of the body. It is found in the mouth, stomach, and liver. The small pancreae are found

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're dealing with all of this. it sounds miserable! while nothing's impossible it's highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in january. even though you've been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them. many disease processes develop slowly over time. this means an initial workup (all those tests you had done) won't always reveal an answer. if you get tested later something may show up. i want to add also that i wouldn't jump to a conclusion of cancer or pre-cancer. nothing in your description would lead me to think "cancer. " i'd just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved. take care!
================================================================================
Question: could a diagnoses of asthma be confused with hiatal hernia?
Baseline Response: Yes, and, for that matter, should a diagnosis be confused by hiatals. The HBS can be confused to some extent with hiaberemia, because it can be seen by examining the central nervous system. But, in general, hiabs are not seen as a major cause of illness, but rather as a result of the imbalance between the different cells of the brain.
What is the difference between hiabelemia and hiatasia?
Hiabeles are a condition in which the brain is filled with cells that are unable to act independently of each other. These cells are called hiabenzia, which is a normal condition of the hiabrachialis. It is often called a hiaberia, because hiabers are the only cells that do not have a cell that can act independently.
Hiatasias

Expected Response: not a all. two different systems (one is respiratory; one is gastrointestinal). and dozens of totally different symptoms and examination findings. there should never be a confusion.

Question: do i need to see a doctor before starting a weight loss program?
Baseline Response: no, this is a very important question to ask.
If you are in a weight room, and you are not sure if you are going to lose weight, then you can ask your doctor to tell you if you need to start a weight-loss program.
What is the most important question you should ask your physician about?

Expected Response: unless you have a chronic illness or take regular medications you don't really need medical supervision when you're starting a weight loss program even if you're obese. there are hundreds of diet books at your local bookstore and i doubt that following any of them would cause any harm. while a really extreme low-calorie diet – 500 calories or so – could be risky nobody can really stick to that anyway. however i do think you should include your doctor as part of your support system and ideally as a lifestyle coach. your doctor can help you monitor your progress as well as provide external accountability.

Question: what is late-stage (dementia)?
Baseline Response: Late stage is when a brain is not functioning properly. It's when you have a complete lack of information about what is happening in the body. This is the case for people who are suffering from dementia, but it's also a cause of dementia.
So I would suggest that late stage dementia is a sign of Alzheimer's disease, or some other disease.
And if you are thinking about early stage dementia, I would recommend that you consult your doctor first.
Do you know any other treatments for late stage?

Question: how often does a doctor legally have to see a patient to continue refilling a prescription on a noncontrolled substance? . i am regularly prescribed a medication for a stable chronic condition. i take it daily. it is not a pain medication or anything that could be abused. for a long time my prescriptions just automatically refilled but now my doctor's office manager is insisting that my prescription refill cannot be authorized because it's illegal to refill a prescription without having seen the patient for a period of time. is this the law or is she lying to make me spend money? . (not pain - topic forced)
Baseline Response: I have a prescription for a drug that I take daily, and I have not been able to get a prescription that I would like to get. I have no problem with my doctor providing me with a prescription, and if my doctor doesn't agree with my prescription I will be taking it for a time. I don't want my doctor to take my prescription for me,

Expected Response: there are no "legal requirements". the doctor sets his own rules and parameters when it comes to refills of chronic medications. many clinicians will let you go a year; others six months. while it can be a hassle and added expense to see your medical provider they are responsible for your care. having you come in is a good opportunity to give you a check-up see about your health maintenence that you may be ignoring (blood tests cancer screenings etc. ). make the appointment and discuss this directly with the doctor. not the office manager. ask for a one-year prescription of all of your meds if he is willing.

Question: yeast infection or bladder infection? . my pee smells unusually bad. very strong smell. after i pee it feels like i have to pee again. doesn't hurt to pee. a day a ago i noticed i'm swollen and irritated. itchy. still doesn't hurt to pee. the strong urine smells gone so is the constant feeling of needing to pee. i took vitamin d and was told that could be why my pee smells bad. i don't feel sick but i'm uncomfortable. could it be a yeast infection or both?
Baseline Response: yeast is a common condition.
Answer 1: yeast infections are common.

Expected Response: it could be both. yeast infections in the vagina tend to itch; urinary infections tend to be painful with urination only and can be accompanied by the urge to urinate even after you have urinated. see your medical provider for a urinalysis to see if you do indeed have an infection needing to be treated. a vaginal yeast infection can usually be treated over the counter with anti-yeast vaginal medications.
================================================================================
Question: how hard is it to get pregant if you have a tilted uterus
Baseline Response: It's not hard, but it can be very difficult. It's a little bit of a challenge for people to get it off.
If you have an unglamorous vagina, it can get very difficult to get off. If you have straight or curved vulva, it's difficult.
That's why I think the best way to get the pregants off is to have a vaginal hysterectomy.
A vaginal hysterectomy is a procedure that is done to remove the cervix and uterus.
It's done in the lab and it involves removing the cervicle and the uterus from the lab.
They're done by doing a lot of vaginal and anal surgery.
You have to go through a lot to get them off. You have to have good nutrition.
And it's really hard to get that off. It can be a little hard for

Expected Response: hey well i have a tilted uterus as well. its not as difficult as you think to get pregnant. i did my homework and researched this when i wanted to get pregnant. if you are wanting to get pregnant it just means you need a little extra help. what my research told me was that certain positions are highly recommended for pregnancy. these positions are man on top with a pillow under your pelvis and also doggy style. these positions provide direct access to the uterus! good luck

Question: when should a new mom seek professional treatment for postpartum depression?
Baseline Response: the mother's health and well-being is important to her and her family.
I've heard that there's a great deal of misinformation out there about postpartal depression. There are a few different theories about post-partum depressive symptoms, but I think there are at least some solid, reliable answers to some of the questions.
The first theory is that postpartomal depression is a form of postpartition. It's a common feeling that you're having a bad time, or have been through a lot. This is because the person has been in the job for a long time and the depression has been there for years.
There's also a second theory that is more common, that post-natal depression is associated with postpartubation depression. This may be because a child is not aware of the physical or emotional damage they're having to deal with post-baby depression.

Expected Response: a new mom should seek professional help for postpartum depression when: symptoms persist beyond two weeks. she is unable to function normally. she can't cope with everyday situations. she has thoughts of harming herself or her baby. she is feeling extremely anxious scared and panicked most of the day.

Expected Response: as a pharmacist i am very hesitant to recommend anything for a child this young. many medications used to treat cough and cold symptoms are too strong for infants and we have to keep in mind that they are not "little adults. " i would need to discuss with you more about the actual symptoms – and in most cases my recommendations are nonmedication ones like running a vaporizer in the baby's bedroom and using saline drops and a nasal aspirator for a stuffy nose. talk to your pharmacist – they will be happy to help you.

Q. What can you tell me about your pain? A. I can tell you about my pain. I am very happy with it. I have very happy body. I do not feel any pain.
A. I feel a pain. i have it very hard. i can see it

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. anytime we have pain that doesn't go away it's cause for concern. unfortunately it's impossible to say what this could be without a physical exam. many conditions could cause the pain you're describing from a case of constipation to an ovarian cyst. if the pain doesn't go away on its own after a few days or if you have other symptoms such as: fever lack of bowel movement pain that increases instead of decreasing nausea and/or vomiting then it's time to seek medical attention. you can start by calling your primary care provider or if you feel the situation is urgent seek out an urgent care facility for an evaluation. i hope you feel better soon!

This is the most common issue you will encounter with your doctor and you should contact them immediately.

Question: what is colitis?
Baseline Response: colitis is an inflammation of the rectum that occurs after a bowel movement. It is a common, painful and unpleasant pain. The disease is usually characterized by a slight, white rash, sometimes covered in mucus. The rash is usually caused by bacteria and other small things that can cause inflammation.
The first symptom of colitis occurs after bowel movements. When the rash starts, there is a mild, painless, but still unpleasant, itch. The itch may last up to 2 weeks. The next symptom occurs after the bowel movement is over.
When a bowel movements is over, the itch may become a little more painful. The pain will last a few days and eventually resolve.
If you are at risk for colitis, you should talk to your doctor about your chances of contracting the disease.
How long do I have to live with colitis before it starts?
In most cases, the symptoms are mild, but some

Expected Response: colitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the colon and is associated with diarrhea pain and blood in the stool. there are numerous reasons for the colon to become inflamed including: infection. loss of blood supply to the colon. inflammatory bowel disease. invasion of the colon wall with collagen or lymphocytic white blood cells. anatomy of the colon the colon is a hollow muscular tube that receives products of digestion from the small intestine and ultimately eliminates them from the body through the anus. the colon is located in the abdomen and has numerous sections that are named based on their location. colitis can affect different sections of the colon. the colon begins in the right lower abdomen with the cecum (located just above the appendix) into which the products of digestion empty from the small intestine. the ascending portion of the colon then ascends from the lower to the upper right side of the abdomen. it traverses the abdomen as the transverse portion of the colon from the right upper to left upper abdomen before descending from the upper to the lower left side of the abdomen. the last portions of the colon are the sigmoid colon low in the abdomen and finally the anus. the colon also has several layers. the mucosa (inner layer or lining) comes into contact with the products of digestion and fluid and actively removes water and electrolytes to help solidify the feces. a layer of smooth muscle (a special type of muscle) surrounds the inner layer and is responsible for squeezing and mixing the undigested food and transporting it through the length of the colon to the anus.

Question: i wake up in the middle of the night choking on a liquid what could this be? . i have been diagnosed with acid reflux and was thinking maybe i had fluid on me. when i burp or swallow liquid follows always making me gag or choke. i was wondering what this could be could it be related to my heart?
Baseline Response: i have a heart attack. i am in the hospital and i am vomiting blood all the time. i know there is a doctor who has told me to clean my blood. i have had to remove my blood glasses for two days and now i am unable to do that because I can't see my heart.
Answer : i am at home and have been going to the hospital for several days now. i believe it is because my blood pressure is going down. i do not know what could be causing this.

Expected Response: it's entirely possible that the liquid you're referring to is in fact stomach acid. it's not uncommon for reflux to get worse when lying down. did your doctor prescribe something for you to take for the acid reflux? if so and it's not working then i'd suggest you return to the doctor to describe what's going on. he or she may want to change your medication or have you try a mechanical approach to the problem such as elevating the head of your bed on a couple of bricks. you also would be well advised to stop eating within two hours of bedtime. i doubt the symptoms you're describing are related to any heart problem but only your doctor can say for sure. no matter what this issue is having a negative impact on your daily life so you should get it checked out again. best wishes to you!

Question: do i need a yearly pap. i'm 60 years old. post menopausal. i've had three children. i've had yearly pap smears all of my life up until age 55. all of them have been benign. do i need to continue having them? i am asexual.
Baseline Response: yes.
Postmenopausal pap smearing has been an ongoing problem for me for the last 25 years. It's not just my pap, it's my body. It has to be stopped. The doctor and I have to be on the same page on every single day. I've had multiple miscarriages, my wife's pregnancy has been over 2 years, my daughters have been at least one year old, and my husband is only 18. I have had several cervical cancer cases over the last 3 years, and one case of cervical cancer was diagnosed in my late 20's. All of that is because I was on a hormonal contraceptive that was designed to help prevent pregnancy.

Expected Response: probably not an annual pap unless you have a family history of uterine or cervical cancer had some risky sexual exposure in the past and are not having any gynecological symptoms. remember that a pap smear is just a test. there are other important components on a pelvic examination that should not be skipped. a pap smear only reveals cervical or endocervical cells that may be cancerous. the pelvic examination can find other abnormalities in the uterus ovaries and pelvic area. like suspicious masses etc. hopefully you are getting a mammogram colonoscopy and other preventative tests needed at your age.

Baseline Response: this is not safe for me. i have a couple of years of use and i noticed that I am not using the washing machine very often. i was very concerned about this and decided to give it a try and it worked.
Answer, if you have any questions please contact me.

Expected Response: it is not likely that any clothing that is sold has dangerous dyes. you are safe. but your hot pink washcloth is not warm pink since the dye is not stable in warm or hot temperature.

Question: we have been trying to have sex everytime i insert into her vagina she says it hurts alot to the point we cant have sex. -have had sex before with less problems. . -finger insertion slowly will work. . -when she wants to move on to full insertion she tries by being on top and controlling cant get past 2 inches without saying it hurts too much.
Baseline Response: we always have sex before we get pregnant. We only have to get pregnant once every 3-4 weeks to make it work.
We have not had any problems with the vagina or vagina wall.

Expected Response: your partner should make a trip to the gynecologist's office to find out what the issue is. many things can cause painful intercourse in women including a yeast infection std and vaginismus. the first step in solving the problem is a physical examination. the gynecologist likely will test for a variety of possible infections before moving on to other potential causes of your partner's painful intercourse. your best bet is to refrain from having sex until an std is ruled out. finger insertion and oral sex both can spread stds like herpes and human papilloma virus (hpv or genital warts). better safe than sorry. once an std has been ruled out keep in mind there are other ways to enjoy the intimacy of sex without insertion. until your partner can resolve the pain issue you can show your love for her by suggesting the two of you enjoy intimacy without pressuring her to have intercourse. wishing you both well!

Question: can hypothyroidism cause premature menopause? . i have hypothyroidism and i am almost 40. my doctor thinks i might be going through the early stages of premature menopause. i have read that hypothyroidism can cause it. is this true?
Baseline Response: it is not.
If you have hypthyroidism you should get a thyroid test. It is very important for you to have a thyroid scan. If you have a hypothyronal disorder, it is important that you get a blood test. You need a blood sample to make sure you are healthy.

Expected Response: hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: do undocumented qualify for the insurance? if also unemployed? what will happen in emergency if they don't have one?
Baseline Response: you will have to pay for it. If you can't afford to pay the cost of an insurance policy, you won't be able to claim it. But if you are eligible for the benefits, you will be able and willing to claim them.
In addition, if you have an active job and you have paid for your insurance through an employer, you'll be able claim it and pay the insurance premiums. If the employer pays your premiums through an insurance company, then you will qualify.
If you have a job, then your insurance may cover a wide range of healthcare services.
How will the insurance policy work?
Under the ACA, you may choose to buy an employer-sponsored plan. This means that you will pay for health insurance through your employer, which you will then pay to your employer. This is called the "silver plan"

Expected Response: unfortunately undocumented residents do not qualify for health insurance under the affordable care act. that puts you in a difficult position if you need medical care. you might try getting care at a local community-based health clinic. generally they provide primary health care dental mental health and pharmacy services. fees vary depending on the type of visit and you'll be charged on a sliding scale. you can find a clinic by searching the u. s. health resources and services administration website: www. findahealthcenter. hrsa. gov/search_hcc. aspx.

Expected Response: your adhd medication should have no effect on your penis size. genetics play a role and some young men who feel their penis is small compared to a limited view of others actually have a normal-sized penis when erect. there is a wide variation in penis sizes when flaccid or erect but the vast majority of the male population has average sized penises. there are no ways to make your penis grow bigger. it is what it is.

Question: i have heartburn; can it worsen my asthma?
Baseline Response: I have heart burn, but it is not an asthma attack.
Answer 2: It's not a heart attack. It's a heart failure.

Expected Response: heartburn is often a sign of a disease called gerd (gastroesophageal reflux disease). although studies have shown a relationship between asthma and gerd the exact relationship is uncertain. gerd may worsen asthma symptoms and make asthma harder to treat. if you have coughing that is not completely resolved by taking your asthma medications then inform your doctor. gerd can be one of the reasons this is happening.

Question: is nausea a side effect of taking vitamin b12?
Baseline Response: Yes, nausea is a side-effect of vitamin b6.
Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19114422
This article was originally published at http://articles.latimes.com/2007/01/27/us-vegetarian-nutrition/

Expected Response: there aren’t too many side effects associated with common use of vitamin b12. the side effects that we are aware of especially at high doses are diarrhea peripheral vascular thrombosis itching transitory exanthema and urticaria. gastrointestinal side effects associated with parenteral cyanocobalamin or vitamin b12 given by injection have included dyspepsia nausea vomiting and mild transient diarrhea. these side effects are very mild or not present at all with oral vitamin b12. again the side effects can occur but usually at higher doses.

Question: are pimple like bumps around an area of eczema common in a bad flare up? . my daughter developed a rash around an area she has eczema located in the bend of her arm (inner elbow). its reddened with pimple like bumps. it seems to have spread a little bit up and down her arm from the bend. she has no rash on the rest of her body at all or any other areas of eczema. is this a common issue with a bad flare up? it is very itchy for her.
Baseline Response: it is. pimple bumps can be quite large and spread out around an eczemesis. They can be very small. and when you get a rash on your arm, it can spread a lot. they are not a problem with eczes and are not common.
Solution:
a) If your eczecesis is a flare up, avoid taking any medications. (see below)
b)

Expected Response: the rashes spreading around the eczema lesions can be due to bad flare up or the rashes can also be due to secondary infection caused by scratching the area around the eczema. please consult your dermatologist who would examine and confirm the cause.

Question: when should you go to the hospital if you think you have pheumonia. i have a terrible fluid sounding cough but hardly cough up anything. i wheeze really bad most of the time and my lungs hurt. i have hep c and cirrhosis if that makes a difference. i live alone and i can't get in to a doctor before monday. i have cold chills and then sweat like crazy but don't seem to have a fever. nothing tastes good i have aheadache and i am sleeping out of pure exhaustion. can i wait? i almost died of pneumonia several years ago but it isn't that bad yet
Baseline Response: this is a good question. you could say that you have a pheumatic fever. you might have a cough, you might get pneumonia, but you probably won't have a hard time coughing. You could also say that your liver is not working well. Your kidneys may have a problem, but the liver is doing the work

Expected Response: go to the er immediately!

Question: can you get rotavirus if you have had the immunization
Baseline Response: I have had it in my body for about 2 months. I had to stop using it for a couple of days because of how it affects my immune system. It was hard to get rid of it because of the virus. I did have one small dose of it for about 7 days. I don't know what I did with it. I think I was about 15 years old and I had a lot of it and it kept getting into my body. I didn't have any symptoms. It's still there but it's not going away. It seems like it's taking a lot longer to get to the point where it's gone. I was in my mid-30s and I was just starting to feel better. I'm not sure if I'm going to have any more of it or not. I haven't had any serious side effects. I've had one person who has had a small dose

Expected Response: yes. the vaccine does not prevent an infection from every strain of rotavirus; just the more common ones.

Question: what are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?
Baseline Response: The following symptoms are common to type 1 diabetic patients:

• High blood sugar

▪ Sudden onset of insulin resistance

Other symptoms

How do I get the medications I need?

In general, you can get the following medications as part of your treatment plan:
. . .

Diabetes is a condition where your blood sugar levels drop or fluctuate when you are insulin resistant. It may occur as a result of the normal functioning of your pancreas, insulin sensitivity or your immune system, or it may occur due to a condition that causes the pancrea to produce insulin.

If you develop Type 1 diabetes, your blood sugars will drop and you will experience symptoms similar to those experienced with Type 1 diabetic. You will also experience changes in your blood glucose levels, which may be difficult to diagnose.
.
"In some cases, the symptoms may be as

Expected Response: the common symptoms of type 1 diabetes are frequent urination increased thirst and hunger unexplained weight loss fatigue and weakness and mood changes.
================================================================================
Question: what causes hyperthyroidism?
Baseline Response: this is an important question and I am going to answer it here. Hypothyroidism is caused by a combination of genetics and a common condition called hyperthyrosclerosis. Hyperthyroid syndrome is a condition that causes an excess of thyroid hormones, thyroid hormone deficiency, thyroid gland tumors, and thyroid gland lesions. The thyroid gland is responsible for thyroid hormone production. The hyperthyroxyroid is a type of thyroid deficiency that is caused when a person's thyroid gland fails. In many cases, it is caused from a combination that is too high. If you have hyperthyrogyroidism, your thyroid gland will be destroyed and you may not be able to function properly. You may have a thyroid problem that can only be relieved by a low level of thyroid hormone. If this happens, you may experience hypothyroid symptoms.
What is hyperthyristia?
This is the condition that is most commonly seen in children

Expected Response: some common causes of hyperthyroidism include: graves' disease. functioning adenoma ("hot nodule") and toxic multinodular goiter (tmng). excessive intake of thyroid hormones. abnormal secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). excessive iodine intake. graves' disease graves' disease which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in this condition the thyroid gland usually is renegade which means it has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via tsh. graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men. graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. these antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi antibodies) thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) and tsh receptor antibodies. graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard nuclear medicine thyroid scan which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively-labeled iodine. in addition a blood test may reveal elevated tsi levels. functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter the thyroid gland (like many other areas of the body) becomes lumpier as we get older. in the majority of cases these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. occasionally a nodule may become "autonomous " which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation via tsh and produces thyroid hormones independently. this becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. when there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones it is called a functioning nodule. if there is more than one functioning nodule the term toxic multinodular goiter is used. functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan. excessive intake of thyroid hormones taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss. these patients can be identified by having a low uptake of radioactively-labelled iodine (radio-iodine) on a thyroid scan. abnormal secretion of tsh a tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). this leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. this condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. to identify this disorder an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of tsh. thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). this condition is associated with a fever and a sore throat that is often painful on swallowing. the thyroid gland is also tender to the touch. there may be generalized neck aches and pains. inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan. excessive iodine intake the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. an excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. certain medications such as amiodarone (cordarone) which is used in the treatment of heart problems contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.

Question: is there a test that shows if a male has ever had chlamydia in the past? . not currently active chlamydia.
Baseline Response: it's not currently actively active, but if it were active, it would be considered a "test" if it showed a high probability of chlamydialysis.

Expected Response: hi if your worried the first thing anyone would ask is have you ever had it it does have a problem of hiding could take many years to reshow itself and you may find can hid from tests. its what one could call a bit of a bugger. one way would be to go to an astd/gum clinic for more info and try getting tested. do hope this helps. good luck

Question: what causes type 1 diabetes living with complications?
Baseline Response: Type 1 diabetes is a serious condition that can cause death, permanent disability or even death. This condition can be caused by a variety of causes. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can have complications such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some type 2 or 3 diabetes.
What are the symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetic?
Type 1 diabetes has the following symptoms:

A red or swollen heart

Hemorrhage, swelling of the lips, tongue and throat

Fatigue, feeling of being weak or too tired

Weakness in your arms, legs, legs and feet

Changes in your sense of smell

The most common symptoms of diabetes are:
.

- blood sugar

. blood pressure

If you have diabetes, your doctor will see you once a year to check your blood sugar levels.
How is type 1 diabetic

Expected Response: complications from type 1 diabetes are caused by one or both of the following: damage to the lining of the blood vessels throughout your body causing them to become clogged with hard fatty deposits called plaques. this process is called atherosclerosis. damage to the nerves ( neuropathy ) that reduces or blocks their ability to send messages to your organs legs and arms and other parts of your body. this damage results from excess sugar (glucose) in your body. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: i have white film red tip tongue which is burning and very sore whole mouth hurts into throat do i need to see dr?
Baseline Response: I have white tapered tip tongue. I am not sure how to describe it. It is burning like the skin of a rat. The black tip of the tongue is burning but the white tape of the tip is also burning. I have a very sore and painful white tinge of the mouth that is burning.
Answer 1: The white tape is not burning but it is not getting thick. It will stay in the mouth for a long time. I would say about a week or so.

Expected Response: sounds like thrush definitely go see a doctor as this usually happens because of suppression of the immune system. an antifungal will clear it up if it is thrush.
================================================================================
Question: is epstein barr linked to liver problems?
Baseline Response: no. In fact, this is a common question, and it is true that this question can be answered by one who knows a lot about the subject. One of the things that is interesting about this question is that it is a question of a very different kind from the one that is asked about the body. One may ask whether the liver is healthy or not, or whether it is diseased or not. It is important to remember that this is an ethical question. If the body is healthy, and the question is not about the liver, then there is no question about the disease. This is the question that is the most interesting.
The question of liver is not something that one would ask about the health of the body, but one can ask about it with a view to understanding the human condition and the way in which it is functioning.
One can ask whether a person has a problem with the liver. A person

Expected Response: yes it can cause lever issues the worst being liver enlargement and/or hepatitis. most of the time a person will ebv infection like mono will only get mild transient elevations in liver enzymes.
================================================================================
Question: my penis is slightly bend towards right does it going to affect my sex life and how to cure it. i have this condition since birth.
Baseline Response: my vagina is not as flexible as it could be.

Expected Response: if your penis is only slightly bent it will not interfere with sexual activity. without having an exact diagnosis it would be very premature to know if there was a treatment or cure; you would need to be examined by a urologist first. there is a condition called peyronie's disease that you can read about that involves a bend in the penis during erections. i don't know if you have this particular condition or not since you have had this condition apparently from birth.
================================================================================
Question: what activities cause the psa to rise?
Baseline Response: the pca is not raised. It is not even raised if the pma is not fully raised.
(1) The psa is not a raised thing. It can be raised if there is no other psa in existence.
2) It is an object of worship. It may be raised or it may not be raised. The pca in question does not exist.
3) The act of raising the pna is not an act of worship, but a form of worship performed.
4) The action of raising it does not make it a psa. It does not change the pia.
5) The same action of rising the pa does not cause the rise of the ppa.
6) The actions of raising and raising the pa are the same.
7) The things raised and raised are different.
8) The thing raised and the thing raised are the two

Expected Response: in general if a man has had a normal psa reading in the past doctors do not tell patients to avoid anything before the next psa test. however if you have had a prior borderline or elevated psa test and want to optimize your chances that the psa is not "artificially" elevated you may want to consider the following: 1. no bike riding for several days. 2. no ejaculation for 48-72 hours but don't abstain too long! 3. no urologic instrumentation such as a urinary catheter or cystoscopy test. 4. no vigorous digital rectal exams or anal sex.

Question: semen analysis. 22 yrs old. doctor said i was unable to have kids but my wife is now pregnant. we need a second opinion. my semen analysis:. . period of sexual abstinence : 2 days. volume : 2. 0ml. ph seminal fluid quantitative: 7. 2. viscosity : not viscous. motile: 50 %. progressive: 40%. non-progressive: 10%. immotile : 50%. normal: 56%. abnormal head: 44%. abnormal midpiece: 0%. abnormal tail: 0%. seminal fluid quantitative:77. 5 x 10(6)/ml (20-250)
Baseline Response: Answer
What is semen analysis? It is a method of determining the level of a spermatozoa, which is the percentage of the total body of the egg produced by the sperm. In order to determine the level, a sperm can be divided into two parts: the cells that produce the spermatozoon, which has

Expected Response: hi have a good read through this link from webmd it will answer a lot of you questions and even some you have not asked yet? <link> well as for being pregnant have you had a test done yet to confirm it? i would then take it and show it to your doctor but as you will read if your sperm count was low you can still father a child. i did read somewhere of a guy they took just 7 sperms from him and it was done by ivf and his wife had a baby so not the millions some of have produced. do hope this helps you. good luck
================================================================================
Question: if you have medicare because of disability can you still get a health insurance policy on the marketplace?
Baseline Response: yes, but there are some situations where it can be difficult to get a policy on an exchange.
There are a few ways to get an insurance policy. One option is to sign up for a plan through your state's exchange. If you have a disability, it's also possible to get health insurance through a state exchange. Some states offer coverage for certain conditions, such as those that require a doctor's note or for certain disabilities. The federal government does not cover health insurance for certain types of disabilities, such.
If you do have insurance through your insurance company, you can get a coverage plan through the individual market. If not, you have to go to a state health exchange. You will need to file your application for an individual policy.
How long does it take to get coverage for a disability insurance policy?
Depending on your state, the federal government

Expected Response: while technically you are not prevented from buying a policy on a marketplace it is more likely that it will duplicate rather than cover the gaps in your medicare policy. the marketplace is designed for people without insurance or people trying to replace their existing policy. there are no medicare supplemental policies on the marketplaces which sounds more like what you might want. about half of states require medicare supplemental insurers to offer medigap policies to those who are on medicare due to a disability. you can visit a state health assistance insurance program in your state which provides assistance for people with medicare. because of the federal government shutdown the best way to find a ship in your state is www. shiptalk. org.

Question: can iron pills enlarge a woman's uterous?
Baseline Response: not really, as a matter of fact, not really. It's just that the uterus is the most important part of the body.
What's the point of having a uterus, anyway? I don't know.
How do iron pills work?
Iron pills are a powerful anti-aging substance that's been in use for several years. They're not really anti-ageing, they're just a little bit of an anti-inflammatory agent.
They're not very effective against aging, but they're not a big deal.
Do iron pills help you with aging?
Yes, because they're very effective.
Why iron pills?
They are very effective because they are very, very effective at stimulating the uterus.
The problem with iron pills is that they're kind of a painkiller.
So, in the body, you can't have an erection.
When I started getting iron

Expected Response: no i have never heard of iron pills enlarging a woman's uterus. there are many medical conditions than can cause enlargement however so it would be in her best interest to see a gynecologist for a thorough examination.
================================================================================
Question: is there a cure for mrsa?
Baseline Response: we are not sure. We have not tested it yet. I do not know what effect it would have on the brain.

Expected Response: mrsa stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus – a particularly troublesome bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. it is one of the “super bugs” that has a nasty reputation. like most illnesses mrsa can be mild or severe. the milder community acquired infections are can be treated (and cured) by topical and/or oral antibiotics accompanied by diligent hygiene procedures. sadly the much more severe hospital-acquired mrsa infections can be resistant to many antibiotics creating a clinical challenge but those too can be cured with the proper treatment. severe mrsa can have fatal outcomes as well. newer antibiotics are being developed to combat mrsa and other emerging-strains of resistant organisms.
================================================================================
Question: is ginko and valerian root the same medicine
Baseline Response: I am not sure that I know the answer to that question. I am just curious if you can clarify this. I have read a number of papers that have been done on the subject.
I have heard that ginkotron and valeralians are different herbs, that they are not the same. I do not know whether ginkos are different or not. I would like to know if you have any more information.
Thank you for your time and the good work.
The following is a quote from the book, "The Antidote to the Antidotes to the Cure of Diseases: The Science of Healing," by Dr. John F. C. McKeon:
"When you are taking a medicine, it is not necessary to take any other medicine than that which is prescribed for your own health. It is simply a matter of taking care of the body and giving it

Expected Response: neither one is a medicine. they are herbs and are different.

Question: can you cough up an embolism. i have a clot in my lung and i am taking eliquis. is it even possible to cough up a clot? i was asked the question and i really don't know but i do cough up stuff. thanks
Baseline Response: the answer is yes, but there is no way to know for sure.
Answer #1: if you are a person who is allergic to elixir, cough up.
If you are allergic to the elixir or to the ingredients in the elixirs, you should not cough up the ingredients.
For those who are allergic, you can use a product called "coughing-up-the-elixir" by the same name.
The product is called a "cushion".
You can buy it at the pharmacy, by mail or at the store. It is called "coffee-down-the elixir" or "cunch-down" because it is

Expected Response: you can cough up blood usually a blood/mucous mixture from the respiratory tract but this is not an embolism. embolisms are inside the blood vessels. if you are coughing up blood it would be wise to consult your medical provider for a proper examination to help determine the source or reason.
================================================================================
Question: i am trying to get an understanding about my diastolic pressure. i have visited my doctor and my systolic number has went for 160 to 130 but the diastolic number has not been so successful it is 92 to 85. what does diastolic pressure mean what do i need to be on the look out for and what more can i do.
Baseline Response: my diaphragm is an excellent indicator of my pressure.

Expected Response: i'm sorry this has been bothering you because there's really nothing you need to do regarding your diastolic blood pressure. let me explain. when we measure blood pressure we write it as one number over another: 140/80. the top number 140 is called the "systolic" pressure. the bottom number 80 is called the " diastolic " pressure. we often describe systolic pressure as the pressure inside your blood vessels at the moment the heart squeezes and pushes blood into the arteries. this is the type of pressure that can cause damage to organs and tiny vessels. when we talk about "high blood pressure" or " hypertension " we are mainly referring to the systolic pressure. we often describe diastolic blood pressure as the pressure of the blood "at rest" in the vessels in between heart beats. even when diastolic pressure is "elevated" above normal it generally is not considered a threat to health. in fact with hypertension diastolic pressure almost always rises and falls along with systolic pressure. what's important with your blood pressure numbers is this: they are both trending downward. that is what we always like to see in a person with high blood pressure. so you are doing well! give yourself a pat on the back and stop worrying about getting your diastolic numbers any lower. you're doing a great job. wishing you well!
================================================================================
Question: how common is atopic dermatitis?
Baseline Response: It's a very rare condition in adults. In fact, most people who have atopic eczema are not atopic at all, and many people who are atopic are not diagnosed until they're older.
For those who are older, it's very common that they're allergic to pollen. In some cases, pollen may come from the eyes or the nose, but in others it may come in from the mouth or from the face. In addition, some people with eczemas may have a history of allergies to pollen, so it's possible that they have some kind of allergic reaction.
Some people may also have asthma, and it's important to remember that asthma is a disease that can be treated by treating the symptoms of atopic allergy.
When you're atopic, it can be difficult to distinguish between pollen and pollen-containing food. If you're allergic, it may take a few minutes for

Expected Response: atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and is becoming more common. it affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children and its onset decreases substantially with age. scientists estimate that 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. onset after age 30 is less common and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. people who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. about 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood.

Question: just as there is "good" cholesterol (hdl) and "bad" cholesterol (ldl) there are also "good" triglycerides. explain? . i recently was made aware of good triglycerides. so i did some research and found this paper online <link> can a medical professional or scientist please explain what triglyceride remnants means in layman terms. need clarification on t"he mechanisms by which "bad" triglycerides develop explain why elevated triglycerides and low hdl--and patients with the metabolic syndrome--warrant special attention" why is this?
Baseline Response: the "good-good" ratio of cholesterol to HDL is about 1.3 (the "good"-1.3) and the "bad-bad" ratio is about 2.8 (the 1.5-2.0).
There are two ways to measure this. 1. The best way is to use a "pre-exposure" or "preparence"

Expected Response: none of the major health organizations emphasize good or bad triglycerides -- the study you found was from 2002 and i have found nothing more recent to support it. the key is to think of heart disease risk like a puzzle with many different pieces. risk factors include high triglycerides high total cholesterol high ldl (bad cholesterol) and low hdl (good cholesterol) high blood pressure hyperglycemia and abdominal fat. someone with metabolic syndrome has a cluster of all these risk factors (instead of just one or two) putting them at even higher risk. for more on how to lower triglycerides see this article and for more on optimal blood lipid levels see this one. good luck!

Question: i am currently insured by anthem blue cross blue shield. i haven't received a cancellation letter yet but am told my plan will not be available in 2014. i live 30 minutes from my physicians in utah and have physicians in my home town in nevada. will i be able to find a plan that has both physicians in utah and nevada as in-network care?
Baseline Response: The plan will be available from the following sites (including my doctor in uta):

My doctor in neva

my doctor in seva
 and my doctor near my house

the doctor in my house and my house near my home

and the doctor in the doctor near the house and near my wife

i have been told that my plans will be unavailable in 2014 and I will need to use a new plan (which is a full plan for this year) to make sure my plan is up to date.

I am currently uninsured in ut

Expected Response: many plans are discontinuing for 2014 in some cases because they don't comply with the law. i suspect it's going to be difficult to find a policy that includes in its network doctors based in different states. you can opt for a ppo option which will allow you to see doctors outside of your network and still get some help covering your costs.

Question: is vigous excersise bad after a heart attack. if i exercise hard on a regular basis after a heart attack can it contribute to the problems associated with remodeling? during exercise my heart will be pumping hard and it seems to me that it would contribute to the stretching of the heart while it is remodeling.
Baseline Response: I have not had any problems with my heart during exercise.

Expected Response: hi i would have thought gentle would be the way to go at first then over time start to slowly build up but i would think 8 to 10 weeks would be a good way to build up. but what has you doctor told you to do or the surgeon who worked on your heart what do they say. to me gentle would be the way to start. good luck

What is the cause of chickenpox in the United States?
Chickenpox is caused by the viral virus known as viremia. Viremia causes chicken to become infected with a virus that causes a fever. Viruses can cause severe infections such as pneumonia and pneumonia. It may also be caused by other diseases such as rabies, mumps, rubella and the like.
How many people are affected by chickenpox every year?
According to

Expected Response: chickenpox is a common childhood skin disease caused by a viral infection. the virus involved is called the varicella-zoster virus. today chickenpox is less common in the united states due to universal vaccination with the varicella virus vaccine though it still occurs in populations that are not routinely vaccinated. varicella-zoster virus is often categorized with the other common so-called "viral exanthems" (viral rashes) such as measles (rubeola) german measles (rubella) fifth disease (parvovirus b19) mumps virus and roseola (human herpesvirus 6) but these viruses are unrelated except for their tendency to cause rashes. in unimmunized populations most people contract chickenpox by age 15 the majority between ages 5 and 9 but all ages can contract it. chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and very young infants than children. winter and spring are the most common times of the year for chickenpox to occur.

Question: why are my nipples burning? . first i am not pregnant. no changes in birth control. i'm prescribed adipex. after beginning this medication my nipples (usually one at a time) began burning. the nipple would burn for several minutes and then eventually stop. the burning eases if i apply pressure or massage the breast. the burning would keep occurring for about a week and then stop happening for months. it hasn't happened for about 2 months then all of the sudden the burning returned. it is excruciating. what is going on?
Baseline Response: there is nothing wrong with your nipples. the only problem is that your nipples are burning. if they are burning, then you are not pregnant and your breast is not going to be able to carry the pressure. you are pregnant because your nipple is burning. i am told that your nipple burning is due to the use of the estrogen that is used in breastmilk. this is a common misconception that women often see as an excuse

Expected Response: hi it seems there are some women who are getting this same side effect as you by doing some research for you. best advice would be see your doctor asap and take it from there it could be hormone related. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my cholesterol is 219/87. i eat healthy maybe too healthy. i am 5'2 110lbs exercise. why is my cholesterol high? . i don't eat much meat. lots of shrimp and fish. i also eat frozen yogurt everyday would that cause it?
Baseline Response: i have a hard time deciding between healthy and unhealthy. i'm not a big fan of meat. but i do like eating healthy, and i do eat healthy. if i get too much meat, i get sick and i need to eat more. i think that the good thing about healthy eating is that you don't have to worry about your cholesterol. i don�t have to eat too much, just enough to get enough of the nutrients that you need.

Expected Response: the good news is your hdl is high (87) which is good. i would look more into the quality of your diet. do you eat enough fiber from fruits vegetables beans and whole grains? how about foods known to help lower cholesterol like oats and nuts? do you get saturated fat from cheese sweets and eating out? i would focus on diet quality -- adding foods to your diet that are heart healthy -- and then get your cholesterol re-checked. for more tips on how to lower your cholesterol see this article good luck!

Question: pain left side below the rib cage & above the hip bone hunger pains eating helps but still pain lots of gas. age 61 pain for 6 months had colonoscopy before that no symptoms also had robotic hysterectomy (40 days) ago (drs thought ovarian cancer scare) pain persists. what is on the left side of the body below the rib cage & above hip bone actually hurts to lie on the left side like laying on a rocks. . . . help. .
Baseline Response: pain right side below and above the rib bone hunger pain eating helps. . , the right side of your body below and below the hip bones actually hurts. .

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish i could tell you what's causing your pain but there are many possibilities. there are no bodily organs in the area you describe. there are only small intestine and the colon. if you are eating and drinking passing gas and having bowel movements those are all good signs your colon is working well. an ovarian cyst can cause pain like you describe and so could healing after a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. as scar tissue forms inside it can contract and be quite painful. this usually clears up over time. the area can indeed feel "lumpy" inside where sutures have been placed. this too should go away with time. i suggest you contact your gynecologist about the pain. he or she is in a better position to give you an opinion about the cause because s/he knows your complete medical history. you have a right to have your pain controlled. this may not mean you have no pain at all. but on a 0-10 scale where 0 is no pain you should be able to aim for pain in the 3-4 range. if your pain is worse than that (and it sounds like it is) contact your doctor for better management of the situation. wishing you well!

Question: is it safe to "push through" fibromyalgia pain? . every time i even attempt to do any sort of exercise the pain doesn't really allow me to do anything. i used to be an athlete many years ago and i would just push through the pain or keep going until the pain went away. i haven't been able to work for years since my accident and fibromyalgia and it is very frustrating. . i am wondering if i can do any damage to my body if i push through the pain? . is it safe to force my body to work through the pain and attempt exercise?
Baseline Response: I do not need to

Expected Response: i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it. if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks. i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want. but there are painful consequences. it could cause you to be unable to do anything. i just know that "pacing yourself" is the watch word here. pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life. it's harder to do than say and requires practice. we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities. i hope this help. start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up. i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non-contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about. good luck hope this helps. and do not forget to stretch!

Question: can a multivitamin cause acne?
Baseline Response: yes. Multivitamins and vitamin C are important in acne treatment and the optimal dose is determined by your doctor.
A multivititamin can help with acne, but it is important to remember that it can also cause skin problems.
How much does a multitamin cost?
A typical multivita costs $1.50 to $2.50, depending on your size. For example, a 12-ounce can of the daily recommended dose of vitamin C cost $3.50.
What are the benefits of a multititamin?
The best way to learn more about vitamin C is to see a dermatologist.
Why is a multigrain a dermatologic?
There are a few reasons why multivitas may cause acne:
The skin is not dry, it is covered with mucous membranes, and it does not get irritated.
If you have a dry skin, a mult

Expected Response: no multivitamins will not cause acne. the most common cause of acne is your own hormones. they most definitely will. i think it has to do with the biotin in my multivitamin. before my multivitamin i started taking biotin to think it would make my hair and nails longer and my face glow. boy was i wrong! i've never had such bad acne in my life - to the point of cystic acne! it was embarrassing and painful! happy to say that as soon as i stopped taking it my face returned to normal and i was never so pleased with my own skin before! a couple months later (i completely forgot about the biotin incident) my mother mentioned how i should take a multivitamin since i'm a vegetarian and don't get all the nutrients i need. so silly me - "yeah sure mom grab a bottle for me! it'll be great! " i didn't even look at the label and about 2-3 weeks into taking half a pill every-other day i started to break out like crazy on the left side of my face mostly my cheek. at first i thought it was due to stress but no way it was because of the multivitamin. i also researched it some b vitamins and iodine are two other big causes of acne. "grrrreat their all bundled up in the little capsule to destroy my face! " moral of the story be weary multivitamins sound appealing but can be toxic (even in small doses)! no. multivitamin does not cause acne.

Baseline Response: The rash appears when the skin of the skin is damaged by the skin-in-your-mouth product that has been applied to your body. The skin is an osmotic material and it has a high rate of irritation. It can also be caused by a certain form of the medication, which is called phenylpropanol. It is a mixture of phenylphen

Answer, plt say you're sorry, and i'll give you a quick update if i'm able to.
So, on the first day, you were just trying to get out of bed, and your roommate was just out of the house, and you were trying to stay in bed with your mom and dad, and all of a sudden the lights came on, and it was a strange feeling. it was just like a dream, like you were in a dream. but you had

Expected Response: most helpful answer no. it will not. coughing clears your airway. i am very concerned about the number of posting regarding "drowning". perhaps it would be in your best interest to speak to a professional about this on-going concern.

Question: i have a question about what happened to my dad. he died on 11/7 from a gangrene infection. . he had colon cancer (stage iv)with a small tumor in the intestine (no blockage) and several metastases on his liver. he had been taking chemo with avastin. we took him to the hospital because he had shortness of breath turned out he had fluid in his lungs and abdomen. how did the gangrene occur? does the fluid block circulation? and why didn't the hospital notice a severe infection like that? how does a person who had no wounds get gangrene and why they would just let him languish?
Baseline Response: his tumor was very small and was very close to the skin of his abdomen. it was very clear that he was going to die of gangrene. his doctor told us he had to be taken to the clinic. but we told him to go to the emergency room and he had a few days to live

Expected Response: i'm so sorry you lost your dad. i lost my dad a couple of years ago. i completely understand your wanting answers about how he died. perhaps the best answer is this: medicine doesn't know everything. we can't keep people from dying. it's no comfort to know that but it's true. from a pathophysiology standpoint i can tell you this: if your dad had metastases (spread of the cancer) on his liver the chances are good he had them elsewhere including the lungs. a doctor once described cancer to me this way: it's similar to starting a row of dominoes tumbling. once cells turn cancerous in one place they begin to turn cancerous in many other places in a domino effect. that means your dad may have had metastases to his lungs and other vital organs as well as his liver. how did the gangrene occur? well i can't tell you that exactly. gangrene is an infection and infections definitely can occur without any wounds. fluid build-up can cause an infection. gangrene may have been the cause of your father's death but another likely culprit is sepsis. sepsis occurs when an infection overwhelms the body's immune system and shuts down all the organs. sepsis frequently is the cause of death in people with pneumonia and other conditions. i'm sorry you feel the hospital allowed your father to languish. i'm sorry he passed away. i hope you are proud that he fought until the very end. i wish i had answers for you. i wish i could take the pain away. i hope you know i sincerely share your pain over this loss. my sympathy to you and your family.

Expected Response: feed a fever starve a cold… gain a few pounds? new research from rady children’s hospital in san diego published in the journal pediatrics sheds new light on the possible relationship between obesity and the common cold. this small study of 124 kids tested for antibodies to a particular form of adenovirus which can cause colds and diarrhea. fifteen percent of the kids had antibodies to the virus suggested that they had been exposed to it previously. but the interesting thing was that on average kids who tested positive for the virus were fifty pounds heavier than kids who had not gotten this strain of the common cold. and even when the obese kids were studied separately the antibody-positive group was 35 pounds heavier than the obese children who had not been exposed to the virus. so it appears as though there may be a link between infection with a cold virus and obesity. now what? do we steer our efforts away from diet and exercise and more toward hand washing and vaccine development? not so fast although it’s an intriguing new direction. healthy lifestyle choices and education are the best tools we currently have to prevent obesity in our kids — and ourselves for that matter. but research like this continues to flush out the role that inflammation can have in disease processes and potentially disease management. years ago we started thinking about cardiovascular disease in a similar way. we knew that cholesterol-rich plaque deposited in blood vessel walls was ultimately responsible for heart attacks but we still didn’t understand how it got there. people latched onto diet as one modifiable contributor — hence recommendations to eat more fish and less saturated fat. but our understanding has evolved to a point where we recognize that inflammation has a critical role in determining who gets atherosclerosis. at one point we even identified a higher prevalence of anti-chlamydial antibodies in individuals with heart disease. this led to studies of using antibiotics as a possible preventive measure but unfortunately it didn’t really work. but the concept of inflammation continues to guide future research and has even steered our thinking regarding how diet may be playing a role. understanding inflammation will likely be one of the keys to understand heart disease and how it can be prevented. it’s fascinating to think that childhood obesity — and possibly other chronic disease processes — will fall under a similar umbrella. speaking of umbrellas it may turn out that walking outdoors with wet hair is worse for you than we thought.

Question: can anyone get dental implants?
Baseline Response: yes.
It's always been possible to get dental implant implants for the purpose of a child. But, you can't do it.
In the US, dentists can prescribe a non-prescription drug to remove the implants. In the UK, they are available through the NHS.
If you're considering a dental implant, it's important to note that you can also use a nonprescription method to remove a tooth.
A tooth removal procedure can be as simple as wiping a small amount of saliva from your mouth with a damp cloth.
However, the procedure can take some time.
What is dental implant?
Dental implant is a procedure to remove teeth from the body. It involves removing the teeth with a dental brush.
There are three types of dental implant:

Forked tooth

Nose

Neck

Ears

Vent

It is very common

Expected Response: in most cases anyone healthy enough to undergo a routine dental extraction or oral surgery can be considered for a dental implant. patients should have healthy gums and enough bone to hold the implant. they also must be committed to good oral hygiene and regular dental visits. heavy smokers people suffering from uncontrolled chronic disorders - such as diabetes or heart disease - or patients who have had radiation therapy to the head/neck area need to be evaluated on an individual basis. if you are considering implants talk to your dentist to see if they are right for you.

Question: why am i losing my hair after weight loss surgery and how do i stop it? . i take biotin (7500mcg) b complex vitamin a zinc and vitamin d supplements daily but my hair just falls out in handfuls. i prefer not to wear a wig so any help would be appreciated.
Baseline Response: i have had hair loss surgery with vitamin D supplementation for over a year and it has been nothing but a blessing. i have also had the benefit of zinc supplementation with a biotin patch. i do not have any issues with my hair. i am not a big fan of biotin and i am looking for a new hair color.

Expected Response: this could be nutritional and a lack of protein could be contributing. it sounds like the nutritional supplements you are taking contain vitamins and minerals that can help with hair growth. however after weight loss surgery a lack of protein in the diet can contribute to hair loss. you need to talk to your doctor to determine the best ways for you to get more protein -- and to determine if that might be the cause. you should eat a variety of types of protein including meat beans eggs rice etc.

Expected Response: i suppose it's not strictly necessary but it's the right thing to do especially if you also let them know about the fact that you haven't had an outbreak. they do have the right to assess their own risk and not telling them takes that choice away. any partner worth your time will respect and value your honesty.

Question: i'd like to know what the best combination of supplements are for a vegan including enzymes amino acids and vitamins. i've been looking into collagen (to improve bone density skin and hair) spirulina (for protein and immune function) maca powder(hormonal function and fertility) omega3 6 9 and digestive enzymes (to help with bloating and stomach problems). i also take a multi vitamin. i am overwhelmed with the wealth of information and would like advice on the best combination as i don't want to take too many supplements when i don't fully understand how they might effect each other. thanks in advance.
Baseline Response: i have been following this site for a while now. i have read a lot of articles and I know what to look for. i feel like i'm missing out on something. and i think i've found something that works for me. I'm not sure if this is the best supplement to use for the body. or if i should start taking a

Expected Response: i'm not familiar with the supplements you are taking. you can look here for more info. my guess is there isn't a lot of evidence to support them. i can help you from a nutrition standpoint though. if you are a vegan and eat a balanced diet you still need to watch out for the following nutrients: calcium: this article will help you figure out if you are getting enough. plant foods and fortified milk alternatives can get you there but you need to be diligent. you can always supplement if you fall short. iron: beans and grains contain iron but they aren't absorbed as well as animal foods. this article can help you ensure you get enough. vitamin b12: plant foods do not contain vitamin b12 so you will can include fortified foods or take a supplement. vitamin d: this vitamin is not in plant foods unless its fortified. you will likely need to supplement. i recommend getting your levels checked at annual physical to determine how much you need. omega 3s dha and epa: plant foods do not contain these important fats -- there are vegan supplements you can look into. if you are still confused consider seeing a registered dietitian. he/she can help you figure out what supplements you need and what you can just get from food good luck!
================================================================================
Question: how is the source of nausea or vomiting diagnosed?
Baseline Response: The source of a nausea or coughing is the stomach.
The stomach is a small, small, soft tissue that has a small opening in the stomach to keep it from getting too hot.
A small opening is called a colon. It is a place where the stomach is situated.
When the stomach gets too hot it becomes a gas that gets released into the air.
There are two types of nausea and vomiting.
Nausea and vomiting can be caused by eating too much, taking too long to get through the meal, or by taking too much in the evening.
Anorexia and bulimia can also cause nausea and coughing.
It is not always clear what causes a nausea and/or vomiting. There is a large number of studies that suggest that people with anorexia, bulimias, and/ or anorexics are more likely to have a headache.
One study

Expected Response: the health care provider will try to find the underlying illness that is causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. at the same time steps will be taken to treat the symptoms and prevent dehydration. any testing will likely be directed to finding the underlying diagnosis. however blood tests may be taken to assess whether the electrolyte balance in the body has been disturbed due to dehydration from continued vomiting. a urinalysis may be done. concentrated urine is associated with dehydration as the kidneys try to hold onto water in the body. ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.
================================================================================
Question: can i have the virus hpv and be negative?

Question: how do i treat severe heartburn?
Baseline Response: It is quite simple. If you are in a state of high stress, you need to take the medication. The only way to avoid this is to take an oxygen mask.
I have a headache that I cannot stop but it is very hard to stop. The medication I take is a medication called ibuprofen. It is used to treat migraine headaches. It can also help to calm your head and give you the feeling of calmness.
You need to get an oxygen tank. If it is not in your house, you can buy one.
If you do not have an oxygen patch, you will need to put on a mask and take a medicine. It will help to get the mask off and keep your head clear.
It is very important that you take the oxygen mask for at least 30 minutes. It may take a bit longer for the mask to come off but it will take less time for it to

Expected Response: when severe heartburn and acid reflux happen nearly all the time it could be gerd or gastroesophageal reflux disease. with chronic heartburn your doctor may prescribe a procedure called an endoscopy that allows the specialist to look inside your esophagus to see whether acid reflux has eroded the delicate lining of your esophagus or caused other damage. here are a few self-care tips: eat smaller meals well before bedtime. avoid triggers such as caffeine and spicy foods. cut back on alcohol and caffeine. stop smoking. lose weight if you're overweight. cut back on aspirin and pain relievers if you take them often. if diet and lifestyle changes don't work you might try: over-the-counter antacids such as maalox rolaids and tums. they may not be as effective for chronic heartburn. acid blockers like axid pepcid tagamet and zantac last longer and can be effective for several hours at a time says the aga. drugs called proton pump inhibitors or ppis. they shut down tiny proton pumps in the stomach that produce acid lowering acid levels dramatically. one ppi prilosec is available over the counter. reglan is a prescription drug that works to stop acid reflux by speeding up how quickly your stomach empties. faster digestion means less heartburn. gaviscon an over-the-counter heartburn treatment works as both an antacid and a foam barrier where your esophagus empties into the top of your stomach.

Expected Response: infectious mononucleosis or “mono” is caused by epstein-barr virus (ebv) a member of the herpes virus family. it’s spread during close physical contact mostly through transmission of saliva. (that’s pretty close earning mono its nickname “kissing disease. ”) ninety percent to 95% of people in the u. s. eventually are infected by ebv although not all of them develop full-blown mononucleosis. people can transmit ebv to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. in studies many people continue to have ebv in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. that’s why most people who get mononucleosis don’t remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. it’s also possible to periodically shed ebv virus in one’s saliva throughout life without having symptoms. it’s not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. fever sore throat fatigue and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. the worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks but fatigue can last for months. vetsika ek. expert reviews in molecular medicine 2004; vol 6(23): pp 1-16. fafi-kremer s. journal of infectious disease 2005; vol 191(6): pp 985-989.

Question: herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .
Baseline Response: she's been infected with herpes virus before, but never with an outbreak.
Answer to herpes transmission: she is a very good communicator, but she's still very contagious, so it's a bit of a mystery.
If you have herpes in the first place, then you're probably not going to want to have any of your partners carry it.

Expected Response: you have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens. for example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice. when we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again. that said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible. in the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body. we even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place: 'genital herpes' or 'cold sore' or 'whitlow' (on the finger or hand). though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites. in other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection. if reinfection does (unusually) happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals. if reinfection does take place (and i stress it is rare) then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip. around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences. let's not get hysterical about the common cold sore. shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter. by its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies.

Question: besides tender swollen lymph node in neck also have lump in front of ear. presently on clyndamycin. possible causes? . swollen lymph node in neck and lump in front of ear appeared suddenly. was ordered clindamycin (on day 3) and no change in swelling at either site. initially had low grade fever. possible cause?
Baseline Response: It was from swollen lymph nodes in the neck and swollen lymph nodules in the ear. The swelling and lump were not from the swollen lymphnodes but from the same nerve. The lump was due to the swelling of the lymph nodes and the lump was not from a nerve. no other symptoms.
Answer 1: no pain or discomfort in neck but swollen lymph in the back of the neck. no pain in back of neck but swelling in the front of neck. did not have symptoms of swelling in back or front.

Expected Response: update from original post. saw ent had biopsy done and ct scan. biopsy was negative for cancer. swelling by ear is gone and one in neck is somewhat smaller. the ent wants me to have the lymph node (neck) removed and biopsied. i'm not in good health have intractable facial nerve pain from dental procedure (going thru nerve blocks for that) among other conditions. i want to wait on removing the lymph node as none of the tests showed a definitive problem. need some advice. probably will ask for a second opinion.

================================================================================
Question: how is atherosclerosis treated?
Baseline Response: it's a very complex problem. It is not just a problem of cholesterol. It's a complex problem of vascular diseases.
Answer : it is a very complicated problem.

Expected Response: once a blockage is there it's generally there to stay. with medication and lifestyle changes though plaques may slow or stop growing. they may even shrink slightly with aggressive treatment. lifestyle changes: reducing the lifestyle risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis will slow or stop the process. that means a healthy diet exercise and no smoking. medication:taking drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure will slow and perhaps even halt the progression of atherosclerosis as well as lower your risk of heart attacks and stroke. using invasive techniques doctors can also open up blockages from atherosclerosis or go around them: angiography and stenting: cardiac catheterization with angiography of the coronary arteries is the most common angiography procedure performed. angioplasty (catheters with balloon tips) and stenting can often open up a blocked artery. bypass surgery: surgeons "harvest" a healthy blood vessel (often from the leg or chest). they use the healthy vessel to bypass a segment blocked by atherosclerosis. these procedures involve a risk of complications. they are usually saved for people with significant symptoms or limitations caused by atherosclerosis.
================================================================================
Question: i am eligible for medicare in may 2014. i currently have no health insurance. am i required to sign up for the aca?
Baseline Response: yes, you will be required to pay for your health insurance if you are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. You will need to provide your health information to the Medicare or Medicare Part D agency when you sign up. You are not required to provide this information to any other government entity, but you may do so if you have an account in the Medicare, Medicaid, or Medicare Advantage plans.
Answer of course, is that the doctor will be able to provide you with a health plan and will be responsible for your medical needs.

Expected Response: most helpful answer under the law you can go without health insurance for up to three consecutive months without facing a penalty. since you're not eligible for medicare until may you will exceed that limit. the penalty is applied to each month you're uninsured. for 2014 the clock doesn't start until april 1. in your case therefore you're only skipping coverage for one month that is subject to the penalty. the penalty is the greater of $95 or 1% of your annual income. so you'll pay 1/12 of the yearly penalty -- it's likely to be a very small amount and no doubt much less expensive than buying insurance. however going without health insurance is a huge risk. if you're injured or diagnosed with an illness between now and may you're completely on your own with regard to the medical bills you'll incur.

Question: can a cold make you have plghem. i keep coughing with huge glops of plghem coming up. i'm not a smoker.
Baseline Response: you can't.
This is not to say that you cannot have plgr, as long as you are a smoker (see below).
I'm not talking about a problem with my coughs. It's just that I have been smoking plgr for a few weeks now and have been getting so much plgr that I cannot stand it.
If you're not a smoking smoker, you may need to change your habits, as I mentioned above.
For example, I'd like to smoke plgr every day for a week or two, so that I'm not getting sick.
So, I've been smoking for 3 months now, and I'm now on plgr 3 days a week.
What I'm doing now is using a regular, no-smoking, no smoking plg, and then

Question: should blood pressure be high after exercise. i am on 10 mg of blood pressure meds but still get dizzy when rushing around. i vacuumed one room and carried vacuum up steps and blood pressure was 170/82 i am not over weight and used to run half marathons. very worried.
Baseline Response: should you keep blood pressure below 100/90 if you have low blood pressure.

Expected Response: blood pressure will be high after excersising. moving around will cause the bp to go up which is why they always have you sit when you are at the doctor's office. even just standing can raise your bp. i would let your doctor know this at your next visit though as i am not sure if it should be going that high. good luck!

Question: what if i become pregnant while taking glucovance?
Baseline Response: i'm not sure what to do, but i think i'll just take it.
I hope you like this post and don't mind if I make you laugh.
Here are the most important things you need to know:
1. You don't need to take glucovate, but you do need to get used to it. If you are pregnant, it is very important to get the right dose.
2. You do not need to use glucovine. There are a lot of options out there for you, and the best ones are the ones you find at your local health department.
3. If your doctor prescribes glucovale or glucovadine, you will be able to take them without problems. But you will need to talk to your doctor. If he does not have the prescription, it may be that you are taking too much and may not be able take them

Expected Response: tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant or have become pregnant. as with other oral glucose-control medications you should not take glucovance during pregnancy. usually your doctor will prescribe insulin while you are pregnant. as with all medications you and your doctor should discuss the use of glucovance if you are nursing a child.

Question: what does “deep cleaning” mean for my teeth?
Baseline Response: deep cleaning is the removal of stains from the teeth. It is done by removing the teeth and removing the stain. It can be done in several ways.
The first way is to remove the toothbrush or toothpaste.
Dry toothbrush
Drying toothbrush is the process of removing the toothpaste and the toothpicks.
If the toothpick is removed, then the tooth is cleaned with a dry brush.
This dry brushing process is called dry brushing.
After drying the tooth brush, the tooth can be removed with a toothbrush.
Deep cleaning is done using the following methods:
Dried toothbrush (or dry brush)
Rinse the tooth.
Do not dry the tooth for longer than 1 hour.
Then remove the teeth using the dry brush (or the toothpastes) and the dry toothpaste (or toothpaste).
Repeat this process

Expected Response: when you go for a regular cleaning your teeth are scaled and polished above the gum line. many adults don’t remove all of the plaque below their gum line on their own. they require a deep cleaning or “under the gum” scaling to remove this plaque and tartar. local anesthesia is frequently given at the dentist to complete this procedure painlessly.

Question: why would a family doctor slap a patient in the face hard several times/ for what reason?
Baseline Response: because I was a medical student.
As a medical students, I am very fortunate to be able to attend many of the top medical schools in the world. There are many doctors who are very popular among students who have attended medical schools for many years.
In my own life, I have done my best to avoid getting into these situations.
I have learned a lot about my profession.
The most important thing is that I am not going to be hurt.
My family doctor and I are both very good friends.
We are friends and I have been very lucky to have been able to work with her and my friends. I also know a lot of the medical students.
Since I have attended many medical schools, I know a few people who are well-known for their teaching and medical training.
That is why I am so grateful for the support and

Expected Response: there is no reason (medical or otherwise) for a doctor to slap a patient unless perhaps the patient was not breathing. but even then a slap is not therapeutic. you would need to ask this odd doctor about his/her medical justification. even if a patient made fun of his toupee. or called him a nasty name there is still no logical reason.

Answer 2: Hair growth is not normal. It is caused by a single cause. It can be caused by:
18. Lack of hair follicles
19. Littering

Expected Response: there are many types of hair loss also called alopecia: gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. more and more hair follicles go into a telogen or resting phase and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. androgenic alopecia is another form of hair loss. it's a genetically predisposed condition that can affect both men and women. men with this condition can begin suffering hair loss as early as their teens or early 20s while most women don't experience noticeable thinning until their 40s or later. in men the condition is also called male pattern baldness. it's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown. in women androgenic alopecia is referred to as female pattern baldness. women with the condition experience a general thinning over the entire scalp with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. patchy hair loss in children and young adults often sudden in onset is known as alopecia areata. this condition may result in complete baldness but in about 90% of cases the hair returns usually within a few years. with alopecia universalis all body hair falls out. tearing out one's own hair a psychological disorder known as trichotillomania is seen most frequently in children. telogen effluvium is hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time causing shedding and subsequent thinning.

Baseline Response: my ear drops get stuck in my ear. I do not have any problems with it. I have no problems with my ears.
Answer, but I think the problem is not with my ear, it is with the way my ears are shaped and how the ear feels. I am not sure if the problem with the ears is my ear or the way they are shaped.
The same goes for my ear buds. I think I am ok with having a lot of ear buds that are shaped in my ears but they feel weird.
I don't know if my ears have a problem with my head, I am just not sure.

Expected Response: i am sorry but i have no way of blindly diagnosing your ear problem over the internet let alone treating you. if your current medical provider is not helping please ask for a referral to an ent (ear nose and throat) specialist.
================================================================================
Question: could my 2 year old's nosebleeds be caused by dry air? how can i prevent this from happening?
Baseline Response: we will have to look into this further. I believe that it is possible for an air bubble to form in the air. We will have a better understanding of how it is caused and what to do to avoid it. We also need to know how to protect our own noses.
Answer 2: how do I prevent it from happening if I am not careful?
Solution: you can look for a "toxic" air bubble. We have a "breathing" test. This will show you if your nosebleed is caused by air bubbles. If it is not, you will need to get some air and breathe in.
Solution 3: what if I don't have a noseblee?
What if I have a nasal condition and it is getting too hot and my nosebleede is not going to be able to tolerate it

Expected Response: nosebleeds that end within 5 or 10 minutes in children without any other signs of a bleeding problem are common and usually are not a sign of anything serious or dangerous. they may be caused by trauma from a bump to the nose or a child's picking and may occur when the weather is very dry or when a child has a cold or allergies. it can be helpful to use a humidifier or vaporizer and apply a small of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment in the nostrils at bedtime to help the nasal tissue heal. for any more concerns or if a child has frequent or heavy nosebleeds in addition to bruising or easy bleeding that doesn't stop be sure to contact your pediatrician. .

Question: how can i treat adult acne?
Baseline Response: I can treat adult skin condition and it's not as serious as the other acne medications. It's just that there is a lot of misinformation about the condition and people don't know about it. So there are people out there who are trying to convince you that it's something that you can treat and they are not.
So, let's talk about acne.
It's a condition that can be treated by both the acne medications and the acne cream.
I've seen a lot on social media about how acne can be used to treat acne. The internet has a lot more of a focus on acne. People like to say that it looks like acne and that acne can make people look bad. That's not the case.
But there is actually a lot that you have to do. The biggest thing is to make sure that you are using the right acne cream or cream that is right for your skin.
There are lots

Expected Response: acne is not caused by dirty skin or by eating sweet or fried foods. acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. the worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly. one would think that as you age you would no longer have issues with acne. however women are especially prone to adult hormonal acne because your androgen levels fluctuate with your monthly cycle. other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. the women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. this form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. this becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin. keeping your face clean is a good beginning and you may want to turn to some of the many acne medications on the market but be aware that these are formulated for severe teen acne and will be very strong. if you wish to try these formulations try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. watch what you put on your face. steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate lanolin lauryl alcohol oleic acid vegetable butters oils and waxes. if over-the-counter acne solutions don't work for you you should make an appointment with your dermatologist. there are prescription medications that can be very helpful to you.

Baseline Response: this is the most common form of epilepsy. It is characterized by a persistent, persistent, and often excessive high frequency of seizures and a low level of attention.
It is a condition that has not been treated, but is considered to be a risk factor for epilepsy.

Question: what is the difference between a class 1 and class 2 narcotic?
Baseline Response: it is the same class. The difference is that class 1 narcotic is a narcotic with no other side effects. It is a class 2 drug with no side effects at all. This is why you must have a Class 2 drug.
In fact, the reason why you are not able to get the Class 1 narcosis on your own is because you do not have the required knowledge about the drug to get this class.
If you do have the necessary knowledge to get a Class 1 drug, you will not be able to achieve the class 1 drug. You will not have a class 3 drug. And because of this, you are unable to get any of the Class 3 drugs.
A Class 3 drug is a drug with a side effect. It has the same side effect as a Class A narcotic.
So if you are a Class 3 narcotic, you can get the class

Expected Response: in the united states narcotics are classified by the drug enforcement administration (dea) into different "schedules" based on several criteria. schedule i substances are defined as drugs with no known medical application and a high potential for abuse. schedule i substances include narcotics like cocaine and heroin. interestingly however marijuana also is classified as a schedule i substance. it remains to be seen if this will change as some states have voted to legalize marijuana and claim it has medicinal properties. schedule ii substances include narcotics that are deemed to have therapeutic benefits yet maintain a high potential for abuse. these include morphine fentanyl and even "mixed amphetamine salts" (the brand name adderall). so basically the difference between schedule i substances and schedule ii is simply in whether or not a drug is deemed to have a valid medical application. hope that clears things up for you! in the u. s. prescription drugs are categorized through the controlled substances act which places drugs into classes or schedules according to the government’s view of potential for abuse. schedule 1 drugs are also referred to as class 1 drugs. drugs that fall under schedule 1 classification are illicit or illegal drugs have no medicinal purpose or use have an increased potential for abuse and if the drug poses a safety issue. narcotics such as lsd heroin and cocaine are all schedule 1 drugs and although two states (colorado and washington) have legalized it and other states allow use for medicinal purposes marijuana is also still classified as a schedule 1 drug. schedule 2 drugs have acceptable medical use and importance an increased potential for dependency abuse and severe addiction. schedule 2 includes opiates with high dose codeine opium morphine oxycodone and fentanyl as well as barbiturates and methamphetamine. schedule 2 drugs also include the adhd drug adderall. the primary difference between a schedule 1 and a schedule 2 drug is whether there is a valid medical purpose for the drug. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: if i am feeling really hungry after exercising what is the best thing to eat after a workout? . and i am a guy not sure if that matters.
Baseline Response: no, if you are feeling really stressed out after exercising you can eat as much as you want. But if you don't want to eat, try to avoid eating until you are tired, and you will feel better.

Expected Response: you do need to eat before two hours. it is good unless it's liquid item then 1hr is sufficient. as for the hunger after exercising out you will always get hunger after even if you ate before. you burn a lot of calories when you workout and your body wants more. it's fine to eat after you workout. that's one of the few times that carbs are okay. after i workout i drink a carb drink that's 400 calories and 100 carbs. and then i drink my protein shake after that.

Question: after a 40 minute walk i feel tired. why.? . i am 62 yrs. old and go for a walk daily but i am feeling tired whole day. please help.
Baseline Response: Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear this. walking is excellent for your health. except when it causes exhaustion! if this is a new symptom i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for an exam and some blood work. many things can cause these feelings of tiredness from seasonal allergies to anemia. only a medical professional can give you a good answer. if you just started a walking regimen and are feeling tired all day maybe it's because you're overdoing it. try starting with a 10-15 minute walk and then work up to longer time periods as your stamina increases. of course while walking is usually considered safe no one should start an exercise program without their doctor's consent. wishing you all the best!

Question: what is an left adnexal cyst. i had some tests done & one the results it says " left adnexal cyst measuring up to 3. 8 mm". what does this mean? is it dangerous? does this require surgery of some sort? thank you
Baseline Response: no, it's not dangerous, it just requires some research.
Answer from L.H.: a few weeks ago, I was diagnosed with my right adnexa cyst, a rare condition that affects almost every part of the body. I thought I was going to have to go to the emergency room but my doctors told me I was on a ventilator because I had a cyst that was so large. So, I started going to the hospital and after a couple of weeks I was back in there.
The problem is, I had no left adxal cysts on my left side. It was my right side that was the problem. I had to go into the

Expected Response: most helpful answer this is a cyst near or on your left ovary. without seeing the results of your test and delve into your medical history i have no way of knowing the significance or treatment approaches. ovarian cysts are more likely to be non-cancerous and may even be self-resolving (like corpus lutiem cysts - the ones that form as a result of monthly ovulation). you will need to discuss patient-specific questions with your own doctor. someone who is familiar with your particular case

Baseline Response: It is so much better to get a better diagnosis than to wait for an emergency.
I have had a lot of people who have had vertigo and I have been told by them that they get it all the time. the truth is that they will never get it. If they have any questions about it, ask them.
The first thing I do is check my doctor's office. I ask them if I am not sure. They give me a letter and tell me that I have vertigo. I have had this for about

Question: if i get a subsidy to lower the cost of my health insurance will that go directly to my insurance company?
Baseline Response: Yes, if you don't have a subsidy and you do.
If you have a health insurance plan, you can get subsidies to get lower premiums and make it cheaper to buy insurance.
A health insurance company can help you get a lower price.
There are some states that allow you to get a premium reduction through a public option. You can get a discount on a plan that is subsidized, but if you get it through a private plan you won't get a reduction.
What's the difference between a public plan and a private option?
A private option will allow you access to a private coverage plan with all the benefits of the plan. It's not as expensive as a public one.
How do you decide how much you'll pay?
If the plan you're buying is subsidized by your state, you'll have to pay the difference

Expected Response: it can go directly to your insurer to lower how much you pay in premiums each month. if you prefer you can pay higher premiums throughout the year and instead take the subsidy when you file for taxes. it's your choice.

If there's nothing wrong with you, it's your fault. if

Expected Response: it's definitely possible to experience real physical symptoms from emotions. so yes that sick feeling in the stomach could be a true physical symptom of your guilty feelings. stress can produce many physical symptoms from a racing heart to dermatitis. some people's bodies are very sensitive to emotion and express those emotions through physical symptoms. i'm sorry you're going through this and suggest you get counseling to help relieve both your feelings of guilt and the physical symptoms those feelings are causing. best wishes to you!

Question: how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant? . we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i don't want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i don't want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he doesn't quit as well. i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker. he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do!
Baseline Response: i am a smoker and i am trying to quit. i know the advice is to keep smoking and it will not hurt his health. he has said that he will not quit if he is given a chance to quit the first time he gets pregnant. he is also not a smoker so i can say that i don´t know how to

Expected Response: i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking!

Question: i have hurt my inner knee before playing football a 2-3 years ago. now im feeling the same pains again what should i do? . the football injury i had my schools trainer check and she said it was pinched cartalidge. it got really swollen and in 3-4 days it went back down but the pains didnt. the pains happen when i walk especially when putting pressure on my heel. the pain isnt unbearable but it surely is annoying since walking is a huge part of where i need to be.
Baseline Response: i can't see what to do. i can get a doctor to check the knee and make sure that it is healing. the doctor will look at the symptoms and advise me to try and return to play football. i have been playing football for over 2 years and have had my knee removed. i think that i need a doctor and a specialist to see if i can return to playing football.

Expected Response: you will need to see an orthopedist for a thorough examination of your knee and probably an mri of that problematic joint. since this problem has been going on for 2-3 years it is high-time for you to get it checked out medically. the school's trainer may have just guessed and a guess is not a diagnosis.

Question: i did not believe the second-hand smoke showed positive in a drug screen. does it or not? . my adult grandson is staying with me at this time. he does smoke pot. i have gotten high from only his second hand smoke. by 'high' i mean i fell asleep in my recliner. i have chronic pain and am never without pain. he smoked in same room for two days and i had no pain since i can ever remember. it did not show on a ua. it has been 8+ years since i actually smoked any pot. is there a chance i could show positive even though i do not smoke pot?
Baseline Response: I believe that if there is a positive negative outcome of smoke in a marijuana smoke test, it should be taken with a positive test. I believe smoke is not a problem for a smoker who smokes pot but a smoker using marijuana.
Answer 2: i do believe that smoking marijuana causes a lot of pain and it's possible

Expected Response: it depends on how much came in to your body. if you were breathing the smoke even a little bit you are technically smoking it or breathing it anyway. if it was enough to give you a relief from your pain then it could possibly show up on a test. it could easily be that the small amount you got from second hand smoke was enough to help you but not enough to show on the ua but i'd advise caution if you have to go through those a lot.

Question: how many doses of recephin are safe for child. my 5 year old was diagnosed with e-coli and has had 3 shots of rocephin but still has a trace of blood and leuks is it safe to give her more?
Baseline Response: it depends on the dose. The dose you give to your child is important to know. Children are not as healthy as adults. You should not give a dose that is too low for your child to get through.
How many doses are safe to use?
A lot of people do not know how many vaccines they have or how many they use. The number depends on what you are doing. The vaccine is usually given twice a day for a week. It is usually in a small package, usually in the morning or afternoon. It can be given to a child who is not sick. The children can be vaccinated and the dose of the vaccine is not as important as the dose you gave them.
What

Expected Response: yes it is safe but may not be necessary. i am assuming this is a urinary tract infection so a trace of blood or leukocytes may not be clinical significant now but if the medical provider determines another rocephin injection is needed it is safe.

Gout is the most serious form of gout that can be treated by any physician. Most people have symptoms of gouts that are mild and/or minor. Gout is usually caused by the presence of certain hormones.

Some of these hormones can also be used for other conditions.
Gouts may be treated with a combination medicine, including a lotion, anticholinergic, or antihistamine. Some people with gout can have a very short period of time after the symptoms of the gout appear.

The best way is to avoid contact with a person who has been infected with streptococcosis (a bacteria that is found in the skin and intestines of people who have had contact with strep infections).
Do not approach a person with a condition that is contagious.
If you are in a group, be sure to have a friend or family member who is familiar with streps.
You may have to be careful to avoid people who are sick with strepos.
Are there any other ways to avoid streps?
If there are any other symptoms of strep infection, consult your doctor. If

Expected Response: yes our nation is at a critical point in which cre infections can be controlled if we address them in a rapid coordinated and consistent effort. doctors nurses lab staff medical facility leadership health departments/states policymakers and the federal government must act now in order to avoid missing this window of prevention opportunity.

Question: i’ve been using an antiaging cream & saw definite improvement. now my skin feels irritated. can you overuse a product?
Baseline Response: no. no.
It has been a long time since i've used antiaging gel, and it is very irritating. I've used it on my face for about 4 months now, and i've found it to be very effective in the short term. i'm not sure if it's worth it, but i would recommend it.
I have a fairly normal skin, but it seems to be getting worse, and my skin seems to get irritated. i was wondering if you would like to try something else to try this?
I've tried a lot of antiaging products, and the ones i've tried seem to be quite effective. I have used the antiaging creams and it seems quite effective in my skin.
Is it safe to use this? i'm a 28 year old male, and I am in

Expected Response: it is difficult to assess what is causing your skin irritation. have you been out in the sun without sunscreen? some antiaging products make your skin more susceptible to the sun. you may now require more sunscreen or may have used another substance on your skin (like makeup) that doesn’t mix well with your antiaging cream. typically we suggest that you stop using everything and reintroduce one at a time. you may have used too much. try smaller amounts and see if you can again get the improvements without the irritation. if it persists go to your dermatologist for help. i think over using these creams must have caused the irritation. i would suggest you to use natural products for your skin as they have no side effects on your skin. visit asyana at <link> to know more about these natural tanning products as they keep your skin hydrated.

Question: i may begin bp medication in the near future. what are the different classes of bp meds and the pros/cons of each.
Baseline Response: i am currently doing a few parenteral drugs, a lot of which are not available in the UK and i have started a bp group.

Expected Response: most helpful answer this is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider. it's a bit too involved to go into here but i'll briefly outline some (not all) of the options. and luckily webmd offers this handy comparison of some common blood pressure medications. a water pill or diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system. this essentially lowers your overall blood volume. if you have tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) you should talk to your health care provider about using a "potassium-sparing" water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse. ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have become a popular choice. these medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure. these medications usually have few side effects. beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts. this combination causes your blood pressure to come down. if your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions. some beta blockers shouldn't be taken when your pulse rate is low. again you ask a good question for your doctor. if you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does (specifically) why it's a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for. hope this helps!

Question: are there any contraindications for taking protonix and prilosec together?
Baseline Response: I don't know. I haven't been told. I am not sure what the prognosis is. I have no idea how long I will be able to use it, but I will probably be able for a couple of months.
A few more questions:
1. What kind of medication should I take for my thyroid?
A. I would recommend a lot of thyroid medication. If you take a lot or if you are not taking thyroid medication, your thyroid will be a bit more sensitive and your body will need more thyroid hormone to fight off the attack of the thyroid.
2. What is the most important thing to consider when taking proterone?
If you have thyroid problems and you have taken proteronolone, it is important to consider taking prosterone, if you have problems with your thyroid, it might help to take it.

Expected Response: i would like to know why you want to take these medications together. you may not be aware but they are actually very similar medications -- think of them as family members so you want to take one or the other not both.

Question: so my friend has herpes and she spit a sunflower seed at me and it landed on a pimple. does that mean i have the virus?
Baseline Response: no, that means that the virus doesn't exist in the skin, it is present in the air.
You can see the difference between herpes and sunflower seeds in the image above. I am going to go ahead and go ahead with this, it will be a little bit more complicated, but I think I will go ahead.
The photo above shows the same problem. The sunflower has the same virus.
And as you can see, it doesn't matter if the sunflower is sunflower or not.
My friend is allergic to sunflower, so she only had sunflower once. But I am allergic to a lot of other plants, so it seems like she only has sunflower twice, and it's not like she has sunflowers.
So the picture below shows my friend having the

Expected Response: no. it would be highly unlikely for you to contract herpes in this odd way.

Question: is there a correlation between hair loss and stress?
Baseline Response: hair loss is an important factor in stress and stress-related behaviors. If you have a high level of stress, you are more likely to have hair loss. You may have a higher level of anxiety and stress than others.
However, when you are healthy, you will be more likely than others to have a lower level of hair loss than others do.
If you are in a situation where you are feeling stressed, there are ways to help you get back to your normal routine. For example, try to work out in the morning to get a feel for yourself.
When you are stressed, you can use a regular stress reliever such as caffeine or a natural hair loss method such as yoga.
How to Get Started:
The best way to get started is to start with a regular routine.
I recommend starting with a hair loss routine and work out regularly.
The following is an outline of a regular

Expected Response: yes definitely chronic stress or other emotional factors may lead to hormonal changes and trigger hair loss. you may see a sudden hair loss pattern associated with stress. this can also signal an underlying medical condition that may require immediate treatment.

Answer from my sister:
Answer.
If you have a daughter or brother who is pregnant, is this a good time to tell them about it?
Answer – A baby is born when the mother has given birth to a baby and the father is not there to give birth.
This is a common mistake in pregnancy and this pregnancy is considered to be the first time a mother has had to have

Expected Response: hi again lets see if this helps you so your cycle day 1 first day of your period day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day now you guys sperm needs to be in place for this and it takes 3 days for it to get there after unprotected sex and once its there can live for around 7 days but its best if you have sex around day 9 the sperm splits up some goes the left ovary and some to the right so out pops you egg and away you go hopefully to pregnancy if on day 21 you get spotting its because its implantation day the day the egg implants itself into the womb lining. so this you should know? yes. but the thing is some women can get pregnant from having unprotected sex during there period it can happen some times its our male sperm it lives just that little bit longer and if your egg drops a day early away you go pregnant. its a funny old world getting pregnant and there are some women who can get pregnant from anytime of the month again funny old world. so as you have already tried to get rid of it have you thought of the abortion pill as your next step this is just a thought. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: are shingles spread just by being in the same room as someone who has it
Baseline Response: no.
Shingles are spread by having a person who has shingled the same thing as you.
If you want to avoid spreading shingling you can use the following:
You can spread shingle on top of someone who is having a shinglet, but you don't want to spread shingle on top.
You have to have a person with shinglets spread on top, so it's a good idea to put the shingle in their face.
A person who is shingeled on top will spread shings.
Do not spread shins as they are not spread evenly by the person.
It's better to spread them evenly on top than spread shinners.
Why spread shining on top?
You want to be able to spread the shining of the shingler to the person's face. So

Expected Response: from what my doctor has told me because i did have it at one time. it is not an airborn virus so the only way that someone can get it is if they themselves touch the infected area or the person who has it has touched it then touches something or someone without washing their hands. if you have not had chicken pox or been vaccinated for chicken pox you cannot get shingles but you would break out with chicken pox.

Question: i read that brushing too hard is bad. over the past 2 months my teeth have become rather yellow. is this tooth damage?
Baseline Response: no, it's not.


* I read that you need to apply a little bit of a lotion to your teeth to avoid damaging your teeth.

 (I use the "treat" brand of toothpaste. It's a little pricey, but the toothpaste works wonders. I use it on my teeth and it's very effective.)


I have a friend who has a few small children who also have the problem of their teeth being damaged by the application of the cream. She has used the cream for about a year and she's now complaining that it's causing her to bite the back of her head.




My advice would be to not apply the cream and apply a couple drops of the oil to her mouth.

. I've tried it on her. She says that it makes her seem like a

Expected Response: most likely it’s time for a professional cleaning. aggressive brushing is bad because of possible abrasion of the teeth. but the yellowing is most likely extrinsic staining that can be removed by a dental hygienist.

Question: sex on 4th may period due on 25th. no symptom in between. heavy/light cramping after 25th to 30th. 9th june no period. i am 18 years. i had protected sex on the 4th of may my period was due on the 25th of may. from 4th to 24th may i didn't get any symptoms. from 25th to 30th of may i experienced heavy to light cramping and legs tingling which are usually my pre-period symptoms. however they soon went away and now its the 9th of june i still didnt get my period. i am really concerned as to whether i am pregnant or just missed my period? please help thank you very much for replying.
Baseline Response: this is a very serious condition and can have a long term effect on your health. As it has been reported on many websites and forums and in some cases even in a medical journal, it is possible that there are no

Expected Response: if you have a fairly regular 28 day cycle a period due on 25th of may would indicate ovulation was expected to be around 11th of may. the 4th of may is 7 days before that but sperm only live about 4 days (at most 5 days) while swimming around searching for the egg. pregnancy would seem unlikely but it all depends on the regularity of your cycle and your certainty about the dates provided.

Question: how do i care for my inhalers and spacer?
Baseline Response: i use a mask.
1. i need to take my inhaler and spacewear off my back
2. i have an asthma attack. i want to help my asthma cure.
3. i don't want to use my inhalered inhaler, spacer, or inhaler in a way that will cause asthma to stop.
4. i am in a home with a smoker. i do not want to smoke my inhaled inhaler
5. i like my spacer in a different way. i know that my inhalant has a greater chance of being toxic to the lung.
6. i think that it is better to have a spacer with the inhaler.
7. i can't stand to smell my inhalated inhaler when i am not using it
8. i also dont like to use a spaceless inhaler (or a mask)

Expected Response: here are some basic guidelines for caring for metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers but be sure to follow any additional instructions your doctor gives you. use a dry cloth to wipe away powder or residue from your inhaler. only use water if your health care provider recommended it. clean a spacer every other day -- or once a week if you use it rarely. remove the soft ring at the end of the spacer. soak the spacer and ring in warm water with mild detergent. rinse the ring and spacer in warm water. let the ring and spacer air dry. or dry them thoroughly with a paper towel before putting them back together. do not store your metered dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler near heat or an open flame.

Question: how many ovaries do women have. i have a girl that said her dr told her she has 4 ovaries is this possible? she gets pregnant all the time she's only 20 could this just be an excuse for as to why she's pregnant all the time?
Baseline Response: she has 3 ovaries.

Expected Response: most women have two ovaries but there are rare congenital conditions where there is duplication of organs. while very very rare a person could have four ovaries two uteri and even two vaginas. the reason this person is pregnant all of the time is not because of the possibility of having more than two ovaries but her lack of practicing contraception. if she doesn't want to be pregnant all of the time there are certain several proven effective methods to keep that from happening. those human eggs are not magically fertilizing themselves.

Question: can castor oil cure cataracts
Baseline Response: no, but it is useful to know that it is a very effective cure for the cataract.
I am sure you are aware that the catarsis in catarasis is not a problem, but when you take a cataroscope and find that it can cure cataria, you will be able to see that it was not only cured, but also that it has been shown to be effective for preventing the cataria.
Answer :
It is quite possible that this is not the case, but if it is then it is because the catarisis is the only part of the catarist's body that can be cured.
The cataroscopy of the eye is very useful for the prevention of cataria as it will help to remove any excess light from the eye.
However, the catarian is still able to get a cataria with his eyes closed.

Question: how is colitis diagnosed?
Baseline Response: it is very complicated. Most people with colitis are unaware of the cause of the symptoms, but if they know, they may be able to help. Some people with severe colitis may have a fever or an infection. The symptoms of colitis usually come in one of two ways.
If you are not sure how to treat your condition, please see the following:

If your symptoms do not improve, you may have other problems that can be treated with medication.

The doctor may tell you that you may need to take a blood test or a test of your blood.
 and a test or test of Your blood. If you have a serious infection, you can also take a test for colitis.
, you have to take test or A test for the colitis, and you can take a urine test.
 (or, but not as part of your treatment plan)

What to do if you

Expected Response: patient history diagnosis of colitis and its causes always begins with the taking of the patient's history. the information the patient provides helps the physician guide the direction for diagnosis and treatment. in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea it is important to find out when the symptoms began how long they have lasted whether they come and go and what makes them better or worse. questions may be asked about travel because infections may arise while traveling particularly in undeveloped countries. patients often ask if the cause of symptoms is food poisoning but that is often a difficult question to answer immediately. if the patient has blood with bowel movements (which in general is not normal) further questions may be explored to screen for colon cancer or polyps. food poisoning not due to bacterial infections usually does not cause blood in the stool. evaluation of the body's other systems (cardiovascular neurological) may be necesseary. physical examination once the history is taken physical examination will be helpful in determining potential causes of the symptoms. signs of more severe disease with dehydration may include orthostatic changes in blood pressure and pulse rate (decreases in the former and increases in the latter upon standing). in patients who are low on fluid or blood blood pressure and pulse may be normal when they lie flat but may change with standing; the blood pressure falls and the pulse rate rises. temperature often is checked for fever. examination of the abdomen will disclose areas of tenderness and potentially abnormal masses if tumors or crohn's disease are present. the exam also may include a rectal examination to test the stool for blood and to feel for abnormal rectal masses. in patients where ischemic colitis is a consideration the health care practitioner may examine the heart and listen for sounds of abnormal restricted blood flow (bruits) in arteries located in the neck groin and abdomen as signs of coexisting vascular disease. in patients where there is clinical suspicion of viral infection no further testing may be needed. however in a patient who appears ill dehydrated or has significant pain fever or blood in the stool more evaluation may be required. other tests blood tests may be useful to explore the possibility of anemia or low red blood cell count due to bleeding. an elevated white blood cell count may be present as the body's response to infection. however an elevated white blood cell count does not necessarily mean infection since the white cell count may be elevated as part of the body's general response to any type of inflammation. blood chemistries may be measured looking for changes in electrolyte concentrations in the body especially abnormal sodium and potassium levels that would suggest serious diarrhea or loss of fluid. kidney function may be checked by measuring the bun (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels; this may be an important clue that patients are dehydrated. as well certain bacterial causes of diarrhea may also cause kidney failure. stool samples will likely be collected for culture searching for bacterial and parasitic infections as the cause of colitis. imaging colonoscopy is a test in which a gastroenterologist uses a thin flexible tube with a fiberoptic camera attached to it to look at the inside of the colon searching for the cause of the symptoms. the appearance of the colonic lining often allows the doctor to make the diagnosis and also provides the opportunity to look for tumors and polyps. biopsies -- small bits of tissue --can be removed from the mucosal lining during colonoscopy and then evaluated under the microscope to make or confirm a diagnosis of the presence or cause of colitis. computerized tomography and barium enemas are tests that are performed by a radiologist to explore the cause of colitis but often are ordered as part of the evaluation of abdominal pain or diarrhea.

Question: if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th?
Baseline Response: it is very low.
Answer :
Question #2: How many days a woman will be pregnant on any given day? Answer : about 5-6 days.
(The chances are very low that you will have to take your own tests and make sure that you get a good test before you go on your first date.
You can also test your own body and check that your body is doing well, but it is not possible to know for sure.
In addition, if you do not get a satisfactory result by a date, the chances of getting pregnant are much higher.
If you get pregnant on an 18th date, you will need to go to your doctor or a specialist

Expected Response: i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did
================================================================================
Question: is there any medication safe to take for anxiety of flying while trying to get pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes. It is important to note that there are some medications that are safe to use for anxiety, but these medications are not for the purpose of giving pregnant women a chance to get their life back on track.
The main reason for this is that the hormones that make you want to fly are not as powerful as they would be if you were not pregnant. The hormones that are needed to make you happy can be found in many different foods, including the foods that make pregnant women feel great.
When you are pregnant, you may feel a bit of pain in the abdomen, but when you have your baby, you will be feeling very happy. It takes some time for your baby to get used to it, and your nerves will start to heal.
Do you know of any other medications that can help you get pregnant while pregnant? If so, please share your thoughts in the comments

Expected Response: i checked this out for you using a pharmacist's reference. xanax and valium both common medications for anxiety are contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to risk of birth defects. also i saw a note saying this is true for most mild anti-anxiety medications. your best bet is to learn some meditative techniques like deep breathing exercises. it's physically much more difficult for you to be fearful if you are breathing deeply and slowly. you can literally trick your body out of panic by doing it. best of all it's god for the baby too. avoid stimulants before flying such as caffeine because they can help you be more nervous.
================================================================================
Question: my two-month-old has a skin rash with peeling and little bumps. what can i do?
Baseline Response: I have a dermatologist who is willing to test your skin and help you determine if you have a skin condition that is making you uncomfortable or if you are experiencing a condition that would make you feel uncomfortable. The dermatologist will give you a prescription for a topical patch and a skin test that will determine if it's a condition you are sensitive to. If you are allergic to a particular patch, they will also be able to prescribe a skin prick test.
In addition, your doctor will ask you to take a blood test to determine if your skin is sensitive to any of the following:
If you have any swelling in your skin that is causing you to feel uncomfortable or when you are feeling more comfortable or if your doctor is looking at you as if you were having a physical reaction.
If your skin has been exposed to a lot of water and your skin

Expected Response: baby acne (small bumps) on the face head and chest is common from about 1 to 4 months. if the baby is not bothered by the rash use plain water when bathing and it will soon go away. check with your doctor for the best treatment (if any) for your baby since there are many different kinds of rashes.
================================================================================
Question: what are warts and what causes them?
Baseline Response: There are a few.
First of all, the body's own immune system is an "emotional system" that has been conditioned to accept and regulate the body as a whole, and the body is thus "emotionally and culturally dependent" on its own internal organs and processes. This is why the body can be perceived as being "wounded" by a single stroke of the body, or even by a few strokes at a time. Secondly, the immune system also "takes" and "reproduces" certain antibodies that can cause certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
Thirdly, the "warts" are all of the same kind: they are all "wounds" of the immune systems, and they are "wound" by the immune response to the body. In other words, they are like a virus that is "taught" to infect you, but it doesn't cause

Expected Response: a wart is a harmless skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (hpv). there are more than 100 known types of hpv. hpv infects the top layer of skin usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. the virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly forming a wart. most warts go away on their own within months or years. warts can grow anywhere on the body. they are most common among children and young adults. there are five kinds of warts. they look different and form on different parts of the body. common warts grow most often on the hands but they may be anywhere on the body. they are rough shaped like a dome and gray-brown in color. plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet. they look like hard thick patches of skin with dark specks. plantar warts may cause pain when you walk and you may feel like you are stepping on a pebble. flat warts usually grow on the face arms or legs. they are small (usually smaller than the eraser on the end of a pencil) have flat tops and can be pink light brown or light yellow. filiform warts usually grow around the mouth nose or beard area. they are the same color as your skin and have growths that look like threads sticking out of them. periungual warts grow under and around the toenails and fingernails. they look like rough bumps with an uneven surface and border. they can affect nail growth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: my son is a student and doesn't have a job. . he's been on and off several medications for depression for the past 4 years. he has learned about a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation. he is hopeful this will be successful in correcting his depression. what insurance options does he have?
Baseline Response: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is not covering him for his medications.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is a national, nonprofit organization with a mission to provide access to information and resources to help individuals and families understand the potential impact of medications on their lives. NIDA provides support and education to people who have experienced a life-changing event or experience. NIMH's programs include:

Prescription Drug Assistance

The American Association of University Hospitals

National Institute on Mental Health

Treatment for Depression

For those who have been diagnosed with mental health issues, NIMM has a program

Expected Response: all health plans sold through the marketplaces must cover mental health and substance abuse services. but the details of what therapies are covered can vary from plan to plan. i would recommend you spend some time evaluating the various plans available in your state and ask for assistance from "helpers" that are available through all of the marketplaces so you fully understand the options and can make the best choice for your son's health.

Question: can a tooth die due to rapid orthodontics treatment a month after braces were put on?
Baseline Response: yes.
It's not necessary to have braces on every day. It's just a matter of what the orthodonist believes is right for you. It doesn't matter if you've been on a roller coaster or a roller derby. It depends on the orthopaedic surgeon you're dealing with.
When it comes to orthodons, the best option is to have your dentist, dentist assistant or orthodomist do a regular checkup.
For most orthodonal surgeries, it's best to get your dentist's opinion on your exact condition.
If you're not sure how to get the best care for your tooth, here's what to do:
Ask your dentist if you have a condition that you want to be treated with braces.
Ask him or her to write down what type of orthodone you're taking.

Expected Response: there is no scientific evidence that orthodontics can "kill teeth. " if there was an endodontic or root canal problem it’s more than likely that it’s been caused by a previous cavity or trauma.

Question: what medications and treatments are available to treat bacterial vaginosis?
Baseline Response: in the United States, there is a vast array of medications available for the treatment of bacterial vaginus infection. There are a variety of treatments available for bacterial vagitis, and there are some that are available for different bacterial strains.

Expected Response: the antibiotics metronidazole (such as flagyl metrogel) clindamycin (such as cleocin clindesse ) and tinidazole ( tindamax ) are used to treat bacterial vaginosis. depending on the antibiotic you are prescribed you may take it by mouth or use it vaginally. during pregnancy women who are high-risk for preterm labor are advised to avoid vaginal application of any treatment. some doctors recommend that all pregnant women avoid vaginal treatments. studies generally show that vaginal antibiotics are as effective as oral antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis. 9 medicines inserted into the vagina cause fewer side effects than oral medicines although they can make you vulnerable to vaginal yeast infection. when considering treatment for bacterial vaginosis ask your doctor whether you should: use oral medicine or medicine inserted into the vagina. some women prefer to take pills rather than using a vaginal medicine. avoid having sex during the time that you are being treated. continue treatment during your menstrual period. medicine placed in your vagina is more difficult to use during your period but your doctor may recommend continuing treatment during this time. avoid drinking alcohol during treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. these medicines can cause severe nausea and vomiting if you drink alcohol when you are taking one of them. clindamycin does not. the mineral oil in clindamycin cream or ovules can cause latex condoms or diaphragms to fail. this is also true for metronidazole cream and tablets (the gel is fine for use with condoms and diaphragms). don't trust barrier methods of birth control when using this type of vaginal medicine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does klonopin show up on a urine drug test?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 1: If you have an elevated urine drug level, klonapin may show up in your urine.
If you have a elevated urine level, it may be possible that your urine drug levels are too high.
Solution: if you have high urine drug concentrations, kronopin can be a good option. If you don't have a urine test, konopin will be available at your local drug store.
Note: konopsil is only available in the US and Canada.
What about other drugs?
Klonopins are not approved for use in children.
Konopins can cause serious health problems such as kidney problems, liver problems, and cancer.
How do I get my prescription for konopedil?
You can get konopingil by contacting your doctor.
Are there any other drugs that may cause

Expected Response: only if the lab drug order specifically includes it for some reason.

Question: could my 1-year-old's ear infection cause a high fever (103f)?
Baseline Response: yes.
A high fever is a condition in which a person's body temperature drops below the normal range. When a person is over the normal temperature range, they can become ill.
This condition is common in children, adults, and young adults. It can also occur in children under the age of 7.
If the condition is not diagnosed by a physician, the child may not have the fever and may not be able to sleep or eat properly.
The symptoms of high fever are milder than other fevers, but they can be severe.
How can I avoid the condition?
If you're feeling ill, you can consult your doctor or seek medical help right away.
What are the symptoms of a high-fever fever?
The first thing that you need to know about a high fevers fever is that it can cause a fever.
High

Expected Response: a fever is very non-specific -- there can be many things causing his fever but if he has an ear infection this is the most likely culprit. most ear infections are preceded by a cold so even colds can cause fevers of this magnitude but unfortunately i do not know enough about your child or his particular case to know if "something else" is going on. don't let a fever frighten you. children can get some pretty impressive fevers. medical providers rarely get excited with fevers under 105f in a one-year-old. children tend to get higher fevers because their immune system is not very good (the fever helps fight infection) and their "cooling system" is not very efficient (we cool by sweating over a large skin surface area so the smaller the body the less cooling). most fevers should improve on day three or four of the illness but if it does not or if you child is experiencing any other worrisome symptoms you will need to have him re-examined.

Question: what is circumcision like in teen years? . we've recently decided to get my 12-year-old brother circumcised because it was irritating him a lot. i was wondering what the risks would be recovery time and how painful it'll be for him?
Baseline Response: it's a very painful procedure. it's not the best part. and i'm sorry but i'm not sure about all the pros and cons. it took me about 3-5 months to get the foreskin to the point where it was about 5mm thick.
So, what if i had to get a circumcised penis from a friend or family member?
Solution: just ask them. i do it to myself, and i have no problem with it. it is the best thing for me.
(i think i'll be fine now)
If you are a guy and you are interested in getting a circumcised dick or penis, please read my article on circumcision.
If I didn't know about circumcision,

Expected Response: remember that most of the men on this planet are not circumsized but rather just the way that nature made them. the male foreskin is just a skin covering not unlike the lips or eyelids. it does not need to be removed and whatever is causing the irritation can likely be fixed. circumcision at age 12: not likely covered by insurance; this would be considered a cosmetic procedure done under anesthesia may be general or local will be painful for several weeks following surgery risk of infection and other post-surgical complications hi don't if he has some kind of irritation is this from him not washing behind his foreskin if its to tight get him to play with his foreskin he needs to start stretching it sideways and length ways and slowly he will be able to get his foreskin back then using a seas salt water wash this will help clean and get rid of any irritations behind it. it would be far better for his later sex life if he is left intact than having a circumcision. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack or tia?
Baseline Response: The prognosis is likely to be a few weeks to a year.
TIA: The risk of transient ischaemia is about 20% and the risk of tia is about 15%.
T-A: T-A is a type of hemolytic anemia that occurs in the brain and is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, hyperphagia, and/or hyperkalemia.

Expected Response: a transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. up to 10% of people will experience a stroke within three months of a tia. since there is no way of predicting whether the next episode will resolve the patient needs to be educated that should symptoms occur they need to access medical care immediately. activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911 is recommended. if a stroke occurs there is a very short period of time where thrombolytic (clot dissolving) drugs [for example alteplase (tpa)] can be used to reverse a stroke. in most hospitals the drug can only be given within three hours of onset of stroke symptoms. in that three hours the patient needs to get to the hospital the diagnosis needs to be made laboratory tests and head ct scans need to be performed neurologic consultation needs to occur and the drug administered. the longer the delay the higher the risk that the drug won't work and that complications like bleeding into the brain will occur. specialized interventional radiologists can inject tpa directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. this can extend the time frame to six hours but currently this treatment is not widely available. tias should be considered the equivalent of angina of the brain. in heart disease angina is the heart pain that warns of potential heart attack. when heart muscle is damaged it cannot be replaced or repaired. similarly brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it too cannot be replaced.

Question: i have been taking penicillin for a bad tooth and forgot. i performed oral sex on my husband and now have a sore throat. some vaginal fluid was present. can i take diflucan while taking the penicillin?
Baseline Response: i am not sure if i should take penicillins. but i can think of no reason to take dibenzoate.
Answer 2: i was using dibenzolinone to treat my pain. i felt it was helping to relieve my pain and it was very effective. i have a lot of dibens and i have not used this much. i am thinking about taking difluoride or something similar.

Expected Response: hi taking antibiotics not only kills the bad bugs but also the good bugs so having oral sex was not a good idea as you have found leaves you open to picking up other bugs. once you have finished d o get on some acidophilus this gets you your good bugs back and working chuck in some yakult and you good as new. your throat could be a yeast infection either see your doctor or go to your drug store/chemist for some otc drugs. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what can be absorbed by the stomach? . what percentages of various normally consumed foods and liquids can be absorbed into the body through the stomach. while i understand that the intestines absorb most of the nutrients we consume i was lead to believe that a potion of some foods and beverages were absorbed into the body through the stomach.
Baseline Response: The intestines can absorb as much of the dietary nutrients as they can absorb from the body.

Expected Response: the stomach does not absorb nutrients but it does play a role enhancing absorption of certain nutrients in the small intestine. for example the stomach secretes intrinsic factor which binds to b12 for absorption in the small intestine. stomach acid turns iron into a form that is better absorbed in the small intestine. and people who have part of their stomach removed may be at risk for osteoporosis because the stomach empties faster which can decrease the amount of calcium being absorbed and utilized by the body. anyone who has surgery to remove part of the stomach should see a dietitian to be sure they are not at risk for nutrition deficiencies.

Question: why can't i lose weight? . i am a 24 year old female and in the "overweight" category for my bmi. i have been working with a trainer and on a strict nutrition plan since june. now four months later i have yet to lose 1 lb! my trainer and i are perplexed! i am so frustrated! my gp thought it would be a good idea to check my thyroid electrolytes and cholesterol and everything came back totally normal. why can't i lose weight? is there something else that could be wrong with me?
Baseline Response: i am very overweight. i am looking for help. i know there is no cure but i am not sure what to do next. i want to make sure that i am healthy and that i have all my health in order to lose weight.
Answer : i am currently in the weight loss phase and i am struggling to lose it. i would like to try some weight loss exercises. if you have any questions

Expected Response: hi. in weight loss the first thing you should do is answer why i gained weight? . gaining weight has many areas and one of them is slow metabolism. no matter how serious you are in diet or how motivated you are to exercise if your metabolism is not working it is all useless. or perhaps you just need some nutritionist that can help you. i found this in google+ and i found out that some of us here tried this one. it is you to find out how effective is this <link>

Question: i had rhematic fever as a child. was just wondering if i need to know what effects that may have taken on my heart.? . how can rhematic fever effect your heart when you get older?
Baseline Response: it's important to note that the amount of time you take to get rhematic fever is very small. It takes about 3 to 5 days for your heart to respond to a fever, which is why we're often asked to measure the time it takes to get sick. The time it take is also important for your body to make changes that help your heart get healthy.
In addition to your body's natural immunity to rhematia, rhematis, and rheumatoid arthritis, rheomatosis is a common problem that can lead to heart failure. It's not uncommon for people with rheumatic fever to develop rheumatism, a condition in which the body becomes unable to process blood and nutrients properly.
A number of studies

Expected Response: i had rheumatic fever as an adult at 40 yrs old. i didn't know what it was but i was very sick for several months before i fired my md and got a new one who put me on strong antibiotics right away. at 54 yrs of age my mitral valve gave out and i had a new artificial mitral valve put in successfully. now at 57 yrs old i have congestive heart failure and the cardio docs are thinking to put in an all purpose pace maker & defibrilator because of irregular heart rates (high -afib/flutter and low). all of it is directly attributed to a congenital heart murmur which was never followed and got worse over the years. the undiagnosed rheumatic fever was the last kick over the edge. i do not have any clogged arteries because i had always taken care of myself with a vegetarian diet and exercise (hiking swimming weight lifting). i have not yet regained all of the prior strength and maybe i never will but i keep trying. it is baby steps toward progress every day

Question: my 3-year-old is taking tamiflu and i gave him benadryl because his lips were swollen. did i give him too much medicine? . i have given him 1/2 teaspoon of benadryl and he also has taken 1 teaspoon of tylenol for his fever.
Baseline Response: I have given my child a lot of bena, a lot more than 1/4 teaspoon of it. I am giving him a lot less than 1 teaspoon. I know his mother and he has also taken a lot, but he has not taken enough. I would like to know more about this.

Expected Response: i don't think you gave him too much medicine but i have to ask why you gave him benadryl for his lips. he may have swollen lips because of an irritation or possibly due to dehydration. you want to be very careful when using medications in children this young; they are not "little adults. ”

Question: my cousin has crohn's disease. she is not taking any medicine and is very stubborn. what can i do? . her crohn's disease is very severe and she is very ill. she won't take any guidance from her parents. she also switches to another doctor if the medicine doesn't work immediately. how can i help her get better?
Baseline Response: i can help her by helping her with her symptoms and by going through her doctors appointment.
Answer 1: i will go through her doctor and get her better.

Expected Response: hi sorry but better she will never be apart from living with it and she can only do that as you can see with its not very nice sorry but if she wont follow a doctors advice then she will die. the only way that might help her to go forward is and she probably knows it is that death is around the corner all you and do is to tell her about this corner and perhaps make it into a very long bend. do hope this helps you and her. good luck

Question: can the appendix grow back? . i have had my appendix removed back in 1989. i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good. how can that be if it was removed? is it possible it has grown back?
Baseline Response: the size depends on the size, but the size can grow at the same time as the appendix.
If the appendix is about the size that it can grow and if it is about 10/8 inch or larger, then the appendix size will be about 10 mm or less.
Answer

Expected Response: well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps! i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an "expert" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail.

Question: why is that my 10 year daughter is developing breast and only one of them is coming in? the other one is still flat?
Baseline Response: she is already growing and is a normal girl. She has a normal body and has a good sense of smell and smell is not the main problem.
If you are talking about my daughter then it is not possible for her to have a normal tumour. I am talking about her in her 10 year age. The other tumour is not growing as much as normal. I do not want her to develop a tumour but I am going to tell you about it.
I am talking a normal breast size girl who is a girl who was born in a normal sized tumour in her tumour at the time of her birth. Her tumour had a normal size in the first year of her life. It was then she was given breast implants. She was given her first breast implants when she was 4 years old. She is now

Expected Response: what is the usual time to be “developed”? lack of any breast development by age thirteen merits some monitoring. the small firm breast buds usually appear about age eleven. by age thirteen a majority of girls have the beginnings of a mound-shape of breast tissue. unless there is an overt reason for lack of development such as illness radiation exposure or hormonal problems there is evidence that breast development can continue until one’s early 20’s. while most all of us have at least some difference in size between our two breasts there are situations where the size difference is very apparent. size differences which onset in teen years will likely equalize for about 75% of women. yours jane h-h

Question: should i worry about toxic shock syndrome? . i'm on my 3rd day of menstruation and use tampons and pads the first two nights only pads during the day. i sleep around 9 hours. never had problems with tampons. yesterday i read up some info about tss. during the night i could feel my heart beating fast and i was feeling warm. when i got up my blood pressure was about 125/88 and my pulse around 120. my body temperature is currently at 37. 5c i have a slight headache otherwise i'm fine no cold or cought or anything. should i be worried that it's tss?
Baseline Response: I don't think it's a tss problem. tss is a normal menstrual cycle. It's a normal way to feel the way you want to. I think it might be a tessy problem if your doctor tells you to get out of the car.

Expected Response: no youre fine. probably just pregnant.

Question: is it recommended to elevate the feet above the heart for a person with congestive heart failure and emphysema?
Baseline Response: Yes. The recommended level of chest pressure for a man with congestic heart failure is about 70 to 80 mm Hg, and the recommended level for a woman with emphysesma is about 75 mm Hp.
I am a cardiologist. The doctor said that I needed to raise my chest pressure. I was very worried that my heart was going to be too high, but I thought I had something to do with the pressure.
Is this okay with you?
If you are on an elevated chest pressure, it is recommended to raise the chest pressure level by about 75 to 80.
If your chest is too high and you are having a stroke, it will probably be best to take a blood test.
My heart rate has been rising since I started the program, so I am wondering if I should raise it. I'm

Expected Response: raising your feet can sometime be helpful in mobilizing fluids in cases of congestive heart failure. but a careful diuretic regimen is key to success as is watching salt and fluid intake closely.

Question: what can a mom do to get their child with mrsa in ear better. his ent is not doing much. its been ongoing for 4 months. . my 20 month old son with ear tubes is battling mrsa in his ear for 4 months. we have done massive amount of antibiotics his ent doctor says that he thinks the last chance we have is to remove his ear tube and replace it as well as remove his adenoids. im really worried that with the mrsa still present inside the ear if it is ok to have him go into surgery. how could he gotten mrsa in the first place. there has been puss coming out of my sons right ear for 4 months. his ent doesn't seem to care.
Baseline Response: the mnsa is getting worse. she is getting so bad that she is actually going to have to get surgery to remove the ear tube. she has been working on it for 3 months now. she gets a bad cut

Expected Response: the ent does care but mrsa (assuming he has a community-acquired type and not the more-severe hospital type) is very challenging to treat. you can ask for an infectious disease consultation but your ent may be doing the best that can be done. you can also ask to see another ent for a second opinion. sometimes we have no idea where the infection came from but we do know it came from people. some people are carriers and do not know it. some kids get it in day-care now. i can understand your frustrations so the only thing you can do is try to get his evaluation and treatment to a higher level but getting a second opinion or adding an infectious disease specialist to the treatment team.

Question: what is the difference between nexium and kapidex?
Baseline Response: nexion is a compound which is found in the alkali water of the alkaloid alkaline phosphatase. kapididex is a derivative of kapido and is found as a component of kapton.
How does it work?
The first thing that you should know about nex ion is that it is a very strong alkaloidal compound. It is very strong and will not kill you.
The second thing that is important to note is that there are three kinds of nex ions:
The alkaline and the alkaline-saturated.
There are also two types of alkaloids: the alkaltic and the nex.
Nex ions are the most common type of ion.
What does it mean to be a nex? It means that you can have a certain number of different types of ions.
Here is

Expected Response: nexium and kapidex (now called dexilant) are both within the same drug class. they are proton pump inhibitors which aid in the decrease of acid production to prevent and/or treat gerd and certain ulcers. they are made by different companies but work very similarly having similar drug interactions and side effect profiles.

Question: can you help with condylox genital warts treatment and side effects? . hi i have used the treatment for the 3days twice a day and now it is sore swollen the skin in white with little open skin marks where warts used to be. also it is a little smelly. is this normal? . the warts appear to have gone but i can't even wipe myself properly once been to the toilet although it doesnt hurt when i do go. i hope you can help.
Baseline Response: yes. I've been using the treatment. I have been using it for the last 3 months. I know it is very hard to get rid of and i can only get rid with regular use. I'm going to try to get more use out of the medication that i'm getting from this.

Expected Response: the most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation. assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods. the chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue. this can appear burned white or even black. this is expected. soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated.

Question: i am having left sided chest pain on the inner side of the shoulder. what could cause this? . when i have this pain off and on i also get a rapid heart beat and the sweats. if i cough the pain and rapid heart beat stops
Baseline Response: i can't really tell how the chest pain is going to affect me, but i have been told that the chest is not actually in the way it should be, and that i can feel the chest in the air. i have had the same pain from sitting on my back for years, and I am now trying to get it back to normal.
Answer 1: this is my first time having this problem, and i do not know if i can do anything about it. i am not sure if i should take a CT scan or a chest exam to see if it is a problem or if it has been something i have done, but if it does not look like it was a problem, i am sure i will

Expected Response: hopefully you have already done so but if not you need to call your doctor right now or call 911. you should not ignore chest pain. this needs attention right away.

Question: if a person is taking klonopin but cannot afford it is it better to request lexapro or pristiq from the doctor?
Baseline Response: if you have a history of any type of epilepsy then you should ask your doctor if it is possible to take klonofenil.
The medication can be taken in combination with klonopa. The most common cause of klonoplasty is epilepsy. In this case the doctor will ask the patient about their history of epilepsy and ask if they have had a seizure.
How to Get Klonopins
Klonopinic injections are available in many countries. The only way to get klonocapien is to take it with a painkiller, such as Oxycontin, and the painkiller can be controlled with a narcotic.
Klonopin injections are usually taken in a hospital, although they may be used in some situations.
If you are taking klonoplasty,

Expected Response: neither lexapro nor pristiq is in the same class as klonopin. you would need to talk to your health-care professional to determine which medication would be best for you.

Question: how can i manage swelling in my feet and legs during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: the best solution is to use a topical steroid that is only available in the USA.
I'm not sure what to do with it because I'm not a doctor so I don't know how to get it. I'm guessing that you can find it online.
My feet and feet have been affected by the same steroid for almost 6 months.
So I can't use it for my feet. It seems to be fine.
What is the best way to manage swelling?
It's not as bad as a steroid but it's not good for my foot.
Why do I feel pain in my foot?
I've been doing it for almost 5 months and I've never felt any pain.
How can I get it?
You can find an online steroid online. It's available in a variety of forms.
The best way is to take a topical cream that is available in

Expected Response: i don't know and would like to.

Question: will penicelin cure an uti?
Baseline Response: yes, it does. It does not.
Source: "The Art of Writing: A Manual of Writing and Writing Technique" by James M. L. Murchison, ed. The Art of Editing: A Guide to Writing and Editing Techniques, New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2002, pp. 7-18.
In a study of the editing of paper, J. J. R. Linton and J. E. D. Doolittle found that, while it is true that writing is an "abnormal process," the effect of penicillin on the process of writing is very different. They found that the process is more or less controlled by the amount of penice that is taken, and that the penice is not taken as a whole. They also found that those who take penicillins have a greater reduction in their penile pain than those who don't take penice.

Expected Response: a urinary tract infection (uti ) is a bacterial infection so an antibiotic is an effective treatment. penicillin specifically may be used to treat a uti but the choice of medication sometimes is based on the specific bacteria causing the infection. it's important not to try to self-diagnose a uti. only a urine sample can confirm the presence of bacteria. many of the symptoms of uti such as pain or burning with urination (peeing) can be caused by other things. that's why it's important to see a health care provider for an examination if you think you may have a urinary tract infection. it's also important never to self-treat conditions like this. never use "leftover" antibiotics (you should never have any leftover antibiotics; it's extremely important to take every pill in the bottle whenever an antibiotic is prescribed) to treat a cold flu or any other problem such as when you think you might have a uti. misuse of antibiotics in this way can lead to the development of "superbugs" that are resistant to treatment. if you think you have a uti i urge you to see a health care provider for a simple urine test. that way you'll be on the right path toward treatment. best to you!

Expected Response: hi so you know how your cycle works yes day 1 being first day of your period well day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day so you need to have unprotected sex around day <negative_smiley>9 it takes male sperm 3 days to reach your womb and sperm can live in you womb for up to 10 days max. so you ovulate after the sperm will be there waiting. if you get spotting around day 21 then you should be pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck. ps look throw away the test kits just leave it to nature relax take a deep breath your get pregnant when your body is ready outside of that get a sperm test done you never know?

Question: how long would it take cancer to develop after hpv exposure?
Baseline Response: The risk of developing cancer is much greater than the risk of being exposed to a direct dose of the carcinogen. This is because the amount of carcinogens in the body is much smaller than that of the body itself, and the amount that is in the lungs is much lower.
Answer, "A small amount of cancer can cause a cancerous tumor. Cancerous tumors are small, so a small amount will cause a small cancer to grow in your body. But it can cause cancerous tumors to spread. So if you have a large number of cancerous cells, you will have a cancer in your lung, and your body will become sick. The amount of the cancerous cell will grow and multiply very rapidly, and that is what will cause your body to become sick."
Answer"A cancerous cancer is one that spreads through your body much faster than the amount it has already grown. The

Expected Response: exposure to an infectious disease like hpv does not imply that you will even get it. even if you develop hpv there is no certainty that you will develop a cancer many many years later but your risk is definitely higher.

Question: i've been dealing with kidney stones for 4 years now. what should i add or remove from my diet to avoid them?
Baseline Response: i need to add some calcium and vitamin D and some fat to my diet. i also need to try some new supplements. i have never had kidney stones and i have no problems with my diet, but i think there should be some kind of supplement that is able to be taken with me.
Answer : i have been working on this for a few months. i'm not sure what the problem is with it. i was looking for a way to get rid of the kidney stones, but the only way i found it was to make a lot of money. i thought i would try this but it didn't work out.
I've tried various different supplements but none of them worked for me. I'm a fairly new person and i just started this. i didn't know what to expect from it.
i've been doing this for

Expected Response: the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if you’re drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones -- the most common type -- eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones.

Question: spermatocele pain any reason why? . ive had it for a couple years and never had much pain. ive been having pain today at about every 5-10 minutes. pain is sharp but dosent last to long. any reason why it could be happening? no other differences with that area have been seen.
Baseline Response: ive never had any such pain.

Expected Response: the pain may not be originating in the spermatocele. conditions like epididymitis can also cause pain in this area as well as tortion (twisting) or infection. it would be in your best interest to see a healthcare provider so you can have this new symptom properly examined.

Question: why is my gf so sensitive that when i touch her anywhere she gets uncomfortable & loses any desire to get intimate? . when we get intimate my girlfriend sometimes loses all arousal because when i touch her it feels uncomfortable on her skin--she has also never had an orgasm. if we move too fast at first it hurts her (even with lubricant) but if i increase foreplay she loses arousal because touching her body anywhere makes it uncomfortable for her.
Baseline Response: when we have sex she is usually ok. she doesn't want to have sex with you and she is always fine with getting off in front of you. she just likes you and wants to be with you.
How to make your girlfriend comfortable with her body and desire to be intimate with you:
First, put your hand over her buttock and then place your finger on her pussy. If she likes your finger, she will like you. If not, she won't like you and will want to get off

Expected Response: only your girlfriend could possibly answer this question but clearly she is having some issues associated with your sexual intimacy. there can be many reasons and some may be deeply private. for instance if she had a past experience that was troubling to her like a prior molestation she may have difficulty. she could have some underlying fears of getting pregnant getting an std or she may be just frightened about sex. if possible she may benefit from discussing this with a counselor or you can try talking with her. i would suggest that you be very gentle and understanding and not push her to be more sexually involved than she is comfortable doing. back off for a while and allow her more time. go slow.

Question: what are the penalties for denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions?
Baseline Response: 1) If you are denied coverage because of an individual's pre-expired status, you must file a complaint with the Commissioner.
2) If your complaint is dismissed or denied, you may file a written complaint with a Commission member.
3) If the Commissioner is satisfied that your complaint has been received and that the Commission has heard your complaint, the Commissioner may issue an order requiring you to provide the Commission with additional information.

Question: it’s sunday and my 3 year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?
Baseline Response: yes, please. I am a doctor and I have a private practice that provides ear care to all of my patients. I have been working with them in the ER for almost a year now and they have given me ear care that is more effective than anything I have ever seen before. I would like to thank them for their time and prayers.
Answer
Answer #5: I have had an ear infection. I've had this infection for a couple of months now and I am very concerned about it. I had the ear infection for about 2 weeks, but it has subsided. I'm now looking for an ear care clinic.
I have been in the care of this patient for about 3 years now. I know they have good quality ear care and I would have preferred to take them to an ER, but

Expected Response: i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an “ear infection” is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the “middle ear. ” the medical term for this is “otitis media ” sometimes called “acute otitis media” to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasn’t been congested it probably isn’t an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you don’t necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isn’t thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isn’t super-miserable it’s ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what they’re feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.

Question: why do i feel a burning sensation in my mouth when i have oral sex with my girlfriend? . when my girlfriend and i started dating we were both virgins. when we have oral sex i feel a burning sensation in my mouth that really hurts. this has only happened the last two times we participated in this sexual act. i have had oral sex with her numerous times in the past. her vagina smells different but not bad. both her and i have noticed the change in smell. we have only been sexually active for about 3-5 months she feels no itching or burning on her side
Baseline Response: it is not a burning or burning sensation. It is just a sensation when i am in my vaginal area. i dont know why. i am not sure if it is due to the odor of her body or if it was the smell of her mouth. i do not know if it's due to her body odor or if her mouth is burning or not. i feel like i have

Expected Response: something has changed. since you were both virgins when you started it could be assumed that you were both free of disease and safe for each other. this changes as soon as one partner is unfaithful to the other and creates the potential for diseases to come into the relationship. maybe you should both see a doctor about this.

Question: in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?
Baseline Response: you can always add more egg whites and some other foods to your diet. i have seen a few people who added whole eggs to their diets and they are able to get better results. i don't know about you but I would suggest adding eggs to your meals as well.
Answer to question: in eggs you can only get one egg per day. you can get two eggs each day.
i think that if you are not able to eat

Expected Response: the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg white more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.

Question: is it safe to take ibuprofen with vicodin? or is tylenol safer?
Baseline Response: I use it with a couple of other medicines, which are not very well used in the body, but it is safe to use in the first place.
The doctor tells me that ibupromine is safe, but I can't remember the exact dose. It is not always safe to get ibupramine, so I take the dose with caution.
If you take ibeprofen, you will be taking 1 to 2 mg of ibupropine. This is about the same amount as the other medicines that I take. I take about 5 mg of it daily. I have not taken the other drugs, but they are not quite as safe as ibuprant.
I have taken ibupristone for about 20 years. I use the same medicine as I used in my previous life, but now I think I have taken the ib

Expected Response: please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

Question: spleen has been crushed & you are bleeding out inside your body how is it possible pure blood comes out of your penis? . blood was coming out of my penis due to a fall where my spleen is it did not cut open my body. i was told that when they opened me up 2+ liters of blood inside me. i'm just curious as to how that blood could manage to come out of my penis. it was only about 5 minutes after i fell & i was able to get up and go to the bathroom & nothing but blood came out of my penis. no one so far has been able to give me an answser as to how this could happen. thanks for any help on this vexing question.
Baseline Response: I'm sure there are some who have been affected by the following. I've had a lot of problems with this issue. I have been diagnosed with a very severe form of herpes simplex. I was given the treatment of having a blood

Expected Response: the spleen is on the same side as your left kidney so one possible explanation for hematuria (blood in the urine) would be a contusion of the kidney with bleeding. free blood in the abdominal cavity from a ruptured spleen would not anatomically be able to get into your "closed" urinary system so i suspect that your injury was not completely limited to your spleen.

Question: i am 17 and sexually active and i've been having some vaginal discomfort recently. recently my vagina have been itching like crazy and a little puffy almost like its swollen and accompanied by burning while urinating and a yellowish discharge with a slight odour. i am not getting any abdominal pain. can this be a yeast infection? . what are some remedies? . are there over the counter drugs?
Baseline Response: i've had some herbal remedies for some time but this one has never been effective. i've also tried some topical creams but i've never had any success. i think there are other remedies that have been tried but i can't find one that works. i have no idea what it is but i think it is a lot of pain.
Answer, i'm 17 and i'm having a lot vaginal discomfort. I've been in a vaginal emergency room for over 2 months now. i'm in the hospital and have a pretty bad case of vaginal sepsis.

Expected Response: go to a gynaecologist immediately if you know the person you have been sexually active with speak to them about their medical problems and maybe bring them to the gynaecologist because they could have something they may not know about. you are experience inflammation discolouration which can be caused by cysts forming on the vaginal wall either from a cut friction burn (are you lubing or just dry balling it) which can get infected. odour is normal in private areas it is just bacteria forming in a humid moist area proper cleaning can fix that but if it smells sickening then it could be harmful bacteria. you could have a urinal tract condition which effects the urinary tract system which could be seen with blood in your pee. make sure you clean it thoroughly before visiting a gynaecologist avoid anymore intercourse with people as you may spread it is possible your partner or partners may be carriers meaning they do not show symptoms similar to yours.

Question: what causes warts?
Baseline Response: warts are caused by the excess moisture in the air, which is called air-wetting. The warts in the body are usually caused by an excess of moisture in air.
Warts are usually called "wetting" because they are caused when the air in the room is too dry to give moisture to the air. It is usually the moisture that is missing from the room.
When the air is too wet, warts become more frequent. When the air has too much moisture, wets form.
I have had several warts that have been cured with water.
For example, I have had a wart that has been cured by a solution of water, and it was cured by using it as a water bath. I have been able to cure it with water, but it is not very effective.
One of the most common reasons for warts is that the water in the solution has become too dry.

Expected Response: warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv) which enters the skin and causes cells to multiply rapidly. usually warts spread through direct contact. each person responds differently and not everyone exposed to hpv will develop a wart.
================================================================================
Question: can a male that is infected with hepatitis c transfer it to a female that is uninfected through sexual contact?
Baseline Response: No, the virus can only be transmitted through oral contact. The transmission of the virus is only a symptom of an infection and is not contagious. If a male infected with the hepatitis C virus is infected in the first place, the first symptoms of the infection are not the same as those of the other infected male. The only known known symptoms of hepatitis C infection are nausea, diarrhea, and weakness.

Question: period after lifting. i am 25. my last pap was 2 years ago it was normal. the past 2 months i have done moderate lifting. every time i lift something my period starts instantly and lasts about a week. my period is bright red with an odor. i have a pain that feels like pressure on my uterus. i am not pregnant. i am moderately active. i jog 2 miles a day and on my feet 6hours a day. i only bleed when i lift something. both my grandma and aunt have had hysterectomies in their early 30s due to endometriosis.
Baseline Response: your doctor said your period is about 6 months. you may have a period at any time.

Expected Response: hi i found this piece of info it may help you. endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes painful or heavy periods. it often causes pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) pelvis or lower back. it may also lead to lack of energy depression and fertility problems. however the symptoms of endometriosis can vary and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all. if your gp suspects that you have endometriosis they will refer you to a gynaecologist (specialist in the female reproductive system). the gynaecologist may carry out an examination of your fallopian tubes ovaries and womb known as a laparoscopy to check for patches of endometriosis. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?
Baseline Response: The first time I saw this adhd it was a girl who was getting a good looking girl for her birthday party. The next day, the adhd was gone. I'm not sure if this was because of the ads or if she got the ad, but it seems like she's been around for so long. She's not doing well, so I'm wondering if this will affect her adhd.
I've never heard of this adhould this affect her performance.
Reply: I was told by someone who works in the media, that she is an actress who is very talented and is not going to get a lot of attention. I have no idea how she feels about this.
The reason I'm so concerned about this ad is that she's still having a hard time getting the right adhd, because she is not

Expected Response: seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.

Expected Response: before using over-the-counter products during pregnancy it is especially important to talk to your ob-gyn and/or your pharmacist. pain relievers such as acetaminophen are generally safe during pregnancy and may help with sinus headaches. if congestion is a major issue it is safest to use a nasal spray that works locally rather than taking a pill that will travel throughout your system. talk with your health care professional before taking anything while pregnant.

Question: i rode a train 12 hrs ago & now feel dizzy & feel like i am still on it. is this motion sickness? and will it go away?
Baseline Response: i have never experienced this before, i had a bad case of 'motion sickness' & i had to get in touch with my doctor. he said i could not sleep, i was in a bad mood & was in danger of dying. he has a doctor that has told me that i can't get out of bed for 2 weeks. i have been told that i need to see my doctor, but i dont think i can. he wants to see me, but he doesnt want me to give him my name. i am worried that i will lose my job & my friends. i want to get married and live in a nice house. but i cant get a job. I dont want to go to university & go to school. I am worried about my future & my kids. i dont want my kids

Expected Response: you may have a condition called mdd (mal de debarquement) a type of vertigo that occurs after an individual gets off a boat usually a cruise lasting several days but it could happen from this 12-hour train trip. people describe the imbalance symptoms as a rocking boat worse when you stand still or lie down. these annoying symptoms can last months or can fade relatively fast. it is more common in women between the ages of 40-50. unfortunately most medications that work for other forms of dizziness (meclizine scopolamine) do not work very well for mdd. valium (diazepam) and the antidepressant drug amitriptyline has been used with limited success. these drugs help block or suppress those aberrant inner ear signals that are causing those symptoms and help with the associated anxiety. vestibular rehabilitation therapy has also been shown to be effective if your symptoms are lasting a long time. since there are many many other medical causes for imbalance and vertigo your first step is to be properly evaluated by an ent specialist.

Question: i have had burning swelling and itching of my labia minora on the left side near the vaginal opening. that side has gotten longer than the right side and a little swollen on the outer edges. i also have a whitish/pinkish pimple on the left side of my labia majora. what could this be?
Baseline Response: It's a result of my own vaginal bleeding. It's not a natural bleeding process. It happens when the vagina is being used as a base for vaginal opening, but the vaginal lining is not properly constructed so the vaginal bleeding is much more intense. The problem is that the vaginal tissue is very soft and not thick enough to allow the vaginal tissues to contract properly. I've had a lot of pain in my lab as a result and this is the reason why I have to have surgery.
Answer to my question: i am using a lab for vaginal hygiene, and i am getting a bad feeling. what can i do about it

Expected Response: it could be an std. you may want to get tested.

Question: my husband recently passed away. what should i do with all of his leftover prescription medication?
Baseline Response: we're having a conversation now about his prescription. We've talked to him about his medications for a while now and we think it's worth the wait.
I have tried many different drugs for him, including a couple of different brand names, but have never had any issues. He has been very clear that he's not going to stop taking them. I think the biggest issue we have is he has a very hard time getting the right type of medication that he wants.
A lot of people have said that he has been going through a lot of things that are just a combination of drugs. I believe that's because he's been on a diet of taking a lot, and I think that's what he's trying to do. He's trying not to go through the same thing.
How do you know what medication he's on?
I don't know. He

Expected Response: this is another great question. medications should be disposed of in a safe and environmentally protective manner. there are several steps you can take to protect children and pets from potentially harmful effects. 1. ) pour medications into a sealable bag. crush it or add water to dissolve it. 2. ) add kitty litter sawdust or coffee grounds to the plastic bag. 3. ) seal the plastic bag and put into trash. 4. ) remove and destroy all personal information from medication containers prior to recycling or throwing them away. there is a small number of medications the fda recommends disposal by flushing. for more information about safe medication disposal please visit <link>

Question: i am 37 and trying to get pregnant for a year and a half. will clomid be effective if i have been ovulating normally? . we have a 4 year old daughter and had no problems conceiving her. both my husband and i were tested and our results were within normal limits.
Baseline Response: Yes, the Clomid Test was not performed on the 5 month old daughter, which is a small and extremely rare occurrence.

Expected Response: in many cases unexplained infertility is associated with an age-related decline in fertility. unlike sperm that are being made continuously eggs are all made before a woman is born. as a woman ages her eggs age which results in embryos that make mistakes in cell division more often. this causes more unrecognized miscarriages (infertility) recognized miscarriages and down's syndrome as women age. the average age that women show up complaining of unexplained infertility is around 34-36 years old. for this reason a common theme in counteracting the age-related decline in fertility is increasing the number of eggs that a woman recruits each month. clomid is a drug that corrects some ovulation problems and it also occasionally increases the number of eggs that a woman recruits. it is a fairly safe and inexpensive first step. however many women will eventually need to use gonadotropins (fsh) to increase the number of eggs. this is call controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and can be followed by intercourse insemination or oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer. the differences between these therapies is the probability of success each month the risk of multiple gestation or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the cost of the therapy. your doctor can help you navigate these options.

Expected Response: smoking is a very unhealthy habit to start in your lifetime. not only can using tobacco products cause cancer and heart disease but it can also affect the complexion of your skin and cause you to age prematurely. the byproducts found in tobacco products deprive the skin of oxygen and vital nutrients. this deprivation can lead to a pale and uneven skin tone. if you begin smoking at a young age changes in your skin can begin to be seen early on. there are more than 4 000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke; many of these harmful chemicals encourage the destruction of collagen and the elasticity of the skin. even being around secondhand smoke can cause deeper wrinkles and sagging of the skin. now let's discuss how smoking physically affects the appearance of your face and body. smoking loosens the skin around the eyes causing deep wrinkles and crow's feet. deep lines and wrinkles can also develop around the mouth from dragging on your cigarette; this look is also known as the "smoker's pucker. " your breasts can also begin to droop and fall prematurely. the skin on the back of your upper arms can also start to sag. you are also more prone to develop age spots (liver spots) on the face and body. your fingers and fingernails can begin to turn yellow or brown after years of smoking; however these stains will begin to fade after you quit smoking. smoking also increases your chances to develop alopecia (hair loss). now that you know how the use of tobacco products affects can your appearance let's look at some of the benefits of quitting smoking. once you quit smoking your circulation improves; this leads to an increased amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the skin. some of the damage from smoking can be reversed by using retinoids antioxidants (such as a and c vitamins) and chemical peels. make an appointment with your dermatologist to see what skin-care regimen is best for you. here are some overall health benefits that come with the cessation of smoking. after 20 minutes your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. after 24 hours your risk of a heart attack begins to drop. after a few weeks the cilia will begin to sweep impurities from the lungs again. after a year you decrease your risk of a heart attack by half. if you want to quit smoking and you are having trouble consult your physician.

Question: i have only had one depo-vera shot but havent had sex since i was on it. is it normal to have irregualr periods? . i had one depo-vera shot so it lasted for the duration of 3 months. at the end of the 3 months my boyfriend and i broke up so i decided not to get another shot. i also didn't like the infrequent periods and wanted to switch. it's been 2 months since the shot expired and i have not had sex. since then i have had my period once with a regular flow. now on my next cycle i seem to be spotting. is this normal since i had the depo-vera shot?
Baseline Response: It is normal for people with depo's to have a depo. but not every depo is normal. if you have a different type of depo than your standard depo, then you may have a normal depo but not your standard one.

Expected Response: yes spotting can be common on this form of birth control. it may improve with time or you may continue to have spotting in which case you may have to find a different hormonal birth control method.

Question: am diabitic and told i also have narapathy how any types of narapathy are there and is any types of treatments
Baseline Response: I have narapeutics. I have met with Dr. Dr. L.F. and Dr. C.F and they have both been very helpful and helpful. I am very happy to have them on board. They are not the only ones that are doing this. I do not think it is appropriate to have a doctor who is not a physician but is also a doctor with narapycosis, or who does not have naraperone. And I think it would be a mistake to say that. I know that many people are in the middle of treatment with narapeutic drugs. And many are going through the same experience and have similar symptoms. So, the question is: what is the right course of action to take?
Answer I think the answer to that is that it is best to go with the right

Expected Response: diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that can happen as a result of having diabetes. there are four types of diabetic neuropathy: peripheral autonomic proximal and focal. the most common location for neuropathy to occur is your legs and feet and some common symptoms are numbness and loss of sensation pain tingling or burning. treatment and management for diabetic neuropathy entirely depends on which type that you have and the specific symptoms you’re encountering. maintaining healthy blood sugar levels will certainly be an integral component of any treatment plan. i really encourage you to meet with your doctor to better understand which type that you have and how you can properly manage it. you can also visit the following websites for an overview on diabetic neuropathy and some treatment options: diabetic neuropathy – topic overview diabetic neuropathy – treatment overview

Question: how does high blood pressure hurt my kidneys?
Baseline Response: I have been diagnosed with hypertension. I am not sure what I am doing wrong, but I am thinking that my body is responding well to it. I have a small amount of sodium in my blood stream, so it is a little bit of a pain. I do not know why, but it is the same thing.
Answer, "I am not thinking about anything. I just have to be in my house and not go to work, and not be sick. I'm not feeling bad."
Answer 1: I am still trying to deal with this issue. I know that I am going to need more time to get the blood pressure checked and to get my kidneys back on track, but at the same time, I am trying to be patient with this.

Expected Response: high blood pressure makes your heart work harder and over time can damage blood vessels throughout your body. if the blood vessels in your kidneys are damaged they may stop removing wastes and extra fluid from your body. the extra fluid in your blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more. it's a dangerous cycle. high blood pressure is one of the leading causes of kidney failure also commonly called end-stage renal disease (esrd). people with kidney failure must either receive a kidney transplant or go on dialysis. every year high blood pressure causes more than 25 000 new cases of kidney failure in the u. s.

Question: can i start smoking after my surgery(maxofacial) it's been one month i already smoked two cigars it there any risk?
Baseline Response: yes, it is.
Answer 2: if you are smoking in a way that is causing the damage you are talking about and that you are not aware of it is also the risk.
When smoking a cigar in a normal way it is not a problem because the smoke does not smoke out of the mouth, it does not stop in the air, it stops and stays in the smoke, it still stays in your mouth and does not reach your lungs. The problem is that your mouth does not work properly, it's not properly closed so it does stay in the mouth. So if you have a problem with your mouth then you need to quit smoking.
If you are trying to get a good smoking experience then you will want to smoke a cigar that has been opened before you started smoking it, if you want to try it you

Expected Response: hi so you had an maxofacal but for what as you have not been smoking for that long perhaps now would be a good time to say no more. just think about it. good luck ps if you want to reply just use answer this above.

Question: is coffee good for your heart and how much coffee? . i heard it was good for the heart one cup a day is it true?
Baseline Response: it depends on how much you need it, but for my heart it was about 15 cups a day.
Do you believe that a cup of coffee should be enough for your health?
Yes, if you want to lose weight.
I have been to many different medical centers, and I am sure many people are aware of the benefits of drinking coffee.
What do you think about coffee?
If you are looking for a safe alternative to coffee, then you will find a great coffee store that will give you the best value.
When you go to a coffee shop, you are not only looking for caffeine, but also a healthy amount of caffeine.
It is important to keep in mind that the amount of coffee you take in depends on the type of coffee and the amount you are getting.
If your body doesn

Expected Response: there is emerging evidence that moderate coffee consumption is linked to decreased risk in type 2 diabetes parkinson's and liver cancer. a recent study published in circulation heart failure discussed in detail here on webmd showed moderate coffee intake was associated with lower risk of heart failure. the researchers recommended 2 average american cups of coffee as moderate which was actually 4 smaller cups in europe. it's important to remember that these studies only show associations and do not prove cause and effect. but if you love coffee you can feel good about making it a part of your healthy diet. i know i do!

Question: is every pharmacy able to compound medications for my child?
Baseline Response: A pharmacy can, and will, compound medications to reduce the risk of adverse events and prevent the occurrence of any health problems. A pharmacy can only compound medications if the medication is not approved by the FDA.
The following examples of medication compounds are:

• Aloe vera: This compound is used to treat the cough and cold.

This compound is also used to prevent the appearance of the rash and colds.
 (See also: "How to Prevent the appearance and appearance of a rash.")

(See also "How To Prevent the Appearance and appearance (A) of a cold.")
.
, , , , and .

,

. , and

; and
 (see also: the "Preventing the appearance" section.)

and (see Also: "Prevention of the appearance (B) of an allergic reaction.")

Expected Response: this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patient’s condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local children’s hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.

Question: what does an iododerma and bromoderma granulomatous reaction look like?
Baseline Response: they look like a thick layer of thick, dark, very fine particles. The iododermal layers of the granulomer are almost completely covered with a layer of fine particles called a thiol or 'black hole', which is what makes them so hard to distinguish from the rest of the matter in the body.
The thiol is a mineral that is found in the thiol layer of the bromode. The thiol in the broma is the mineral that gives the appearance of a thilb. The red and yellow thiols in the granular layers are the thilbs.
A thiol from the thiobromode, a thiocyanate from the biol, or a thitb from the granules of the thioobromodes is called a iododermium, which is a type of th

Expected Response: a granulomatous reaction is a skin reaction caused by drugs called iodides and bromides.

Question: is a flotation pod (containing 150 gallons of water & 1000 pounds of epsom salt) safe for a person with kidney disease? . i made an appointment for a session in a sensory deprivation pod which contains 150 gallons of water mixed with 1000 pounds of epsom salt. after i made the appointment they sent me a form to fill out stating either i don't have kidney disease or i understand the risks to me. i do have kidney disease. but it was my understanding that the epsom salt would not be absorbed through my skin.
Baseline Response: the flotation pods are not safe for people with kidney diseases because of the toxic chemicals in their environment. i'm not sure if i can go into a sensory overload pod to get an accurate picture of my body health. i have been on a sensory diet for years and i've been on it for a long time. i just have to wait for my body to recover. the way i feel about the way my body

Expected Response: there are many types of kidney disease so unfortunately i don't really have any information about your kidney issues in order to be able to comment. my suggestion is for you to consult your nephrologist or primary care medical provider first -- someone who knows your medical history. epsom salt deprivation chambers are likely to be just fine and you are correct. you will not absorb anything through your skin. you certainly will not be drinking it!

Question: how does smoke affect allergies?
Baseline Response: the main effect of smoking is to suppress or eliminate the airway (the "larynx"). The "l" is a short piece of tissue that surrounds the mouth. The "r" is the nasal nerve that runs from the tip of the nose to the back of the throat.
The "lax" is what you think of when you hear someone talking about smoking.
When you smoke, you get a bit of a puff, but this is not a bad thing. It is just that you have to take a little bit longer to get used to it.
A smoker who smokes a lot of smoke (1-3 cigarettes a day) has a higher risk of developing allergies to a certain type of tobacco, such as tobacco smoke (e.g., cigarette smoke).
The problem with this type of smoke is that it is very difficult to tell if it is a smoke or not.
This is because smoke is

Expected Response: webmd allergy consultant paul enright md an arizona-based pulmonologist tells webmd that it's important to keep kids with childhood allergies away from all smoke. "don't let anyone smoke around the child since smoke increases the deposition of allergens in the nose and lungs. also don't use a fireplace burn candles burn incense or use plug-in air fresheners. " in addition be aware of weather changes as sudden changes in temperature or an increase in humidity may increase the child's allergy symptoms.

Question: can hpv lay dormant in your system and for how long? . can the virus lay dormant in your system and not show up for years later! im married and have been with the same partner for the last 4 years and all my paps have come back normal until now. this concerns me.
Baseline Response: i have a few other pups and i have to wait for them to recover to take care of them. its been a while since i had any other issues with them.
The problem with this problem is that you have to go through a lot of paperwork. you have the legal guardian or court order to go to the doctor to get the virus to show up on your system. then you have a lot more paperwork to go on the way to getting the virus off your system to show your mom and dad.
You have to pay for the legal and medical costs and the court order that comes with it. i have been told by my mom that it was the first

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're dealing with an abnormal pap smear result. before i get to your questions about hpv let's back up for just a moment. an abnormal pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have human papillomavirus (hpv). the pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. an abnormal pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. in fact most abnormal pap test results are not cancer at all. certainly hpv can cause cervical cancer. however you need to receive a special test (not unlike a pap test actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for hpv. in answer to your question hpv is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. the centers for disease control estimate as many as 50% of sexually active men and women get hpv at some point in their lives. often people who are infected with it have no symptoms. so while it's not exactly true to say hpv can lie dormant in your system it is accurate to say you can be infected with hpv and live with it for many years without knowing it. your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal pap test result with you. when that happens you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about hpv. i hope you find this response helpful!

Question: how is drug-induced hair loss treated?
Baseline Response: The treatment of hair loss with the use of a hair-stimulating substance (such as a topical hair-inhibiting drug) is well documented. However, there are a number of different treatments that can be used to reduce hair loss. For example, the use in some cases of a topical gel (such a gel used for scalp hair removal or hair combing) can help reduce the risk of hair growth.
If you are a woman who has been subjected to a long-term hair loss procedure, the treatment of this condition is well known. However there is a few different treatments to be used for the treatment:
The use of hair-removing agents (such the scalp hair-repellent, hair-fusing and hair-wicking agents)
The treatment of scalp hair loss (such treatment of the scalp or scalp-hair loss condition)
For more information about the treatment and how to

Expected Response: it's important to review any medications you take and discuss their potential side effects with your doctor and pharmacist. when hair loss does occur from a drug you're taking there is a good chance that the hair will grow back on its own after you stop taking the medication. if stopping the drug does not improve hair thinning you may need to be treated with finasteride (propecia) or minoxidil (rogaine) medications that slow hair loss and can stimulate new hair growth. one technique may help prevent hair loss during chemotherapy. it's called scalp hypothermia and it involves placing ice packs on the scalp a few minutes before -- and for about a half-hour after -- chemotherapy treatment. cooling the scalp reduces blood flow to the hair follicles making it harder for the chemotherapy drugs to get into the follicular cells. cooling also reduces biochemical activity making the hair follicles less susceptible to damage from chemotherapy drugs. one concern with this technique is the risk of cancer recurrence in the scalp. after chemotherapy treatment the hair usually grows back in very quickly but it may change in texture. in rare cases the hair will stay thin even after treatment has been stopped. minoxidil can help regrow hair that is slow to return. some chemotherapy patients wear a wig or hat to hide their hair loss until their hair grows back.

Question: contagious period for cold. i have been sick with a cold off and on for about 2 months. the last time i got sick was about week ago. i am going to visit my sister and her newborn. is it safe to do so?
Baseline Response: no. i live in the Midwest and i am in a small town in the south. i do not live in a cold area of the Midwest.
Answer : I have been living in a house in a city with a lot of people. the house is a lot colder than in a suburb of a city. the neighbors are not really in the cold area. i also have heard of people that have died in the same house. i can tell you that the cold is not a problem for me. i know that there are people that are not cold and that there is no reason to be afraid of them. i don't think they should be afraid. I am not afraid of anyone. I do not think that if people

Expected Response: a cold only lasts a week so i am concerned that you have been sick for two months. you are either getting back to back colds or there is another reason for your symptoms. since i have no way of knowing exactly what you have or when you contracted your "cold" i really cannot tell you if you are contagious or not. well avoid meeting a newborn if you are down with cold and cough as it is highly contagious. we advise to take curcuma with tinospora powder daily to increase your immunity. steam inhalation will help you get rid of viral infection. in warmth cold virus cannot survive.

Question: can allergy shots affect sexual function? . i've recently started experiencing difficulty reaching an orgasm. i am on hrt and 57 years old. i am trying to narrow down what might be the cause and the only change i have made has been in starting allergy shots at the first of the year. . . . this may be a reach in my thinking. i have been unable to reach my ob/gyn doctor to ask her questions and the information online with regard to sexually active older women is almost non-existent. men apparently rate #1.
Baseline Response: yes. men are more likely to become sexually active than women. .
Answer : men have a lower risk of developing penile cancer than women do. .

Expected Response: i have never heard that allergy shots would have any adverse sexual side-effects. as a matter of fact i do not think it would be medically possible for this to ever happen. see your ob-gyn for a consultation. if there is a discoverable cause for your inorgasmia it will not be your allergy shots.

Question: how to relieve hives? . for adults
Baseline Response: In order to help reduce hives, use some essential oils, like olive oil, garlic, and some herbs, such as thyme, thyme root, and oregano.
In order to prevent hives from growing in your house, you should be using the following methods:
1. Do not use any oil that is not safe for humans.

Expected Response: i don't know the accuracy or even the type of tests that you had. this may be question for the lab or the medical provider who ordered them. there are many people have had sex with a herpes infected partner who have not contracted the disease. i suspect your 20 second encounter was a "missed bullet" and that you did not get herpes but that is just a guess based on what you have shared.

Question: can i still end up pregnant if my man ejaculated inside of me two days before leaking cervical fluid? . i had unprotected sex on october 18th and on october 21st. both times my man ejaculated inside of me. i just started to leak some cervical fluid today and wanted to know if there is still a chance that i could end up pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes, you can still end your pregnancy if you ejaculate within the first 2 weeks of pregnancy, but you will need to wait at least 2 weeks to get your period to the point where you will be able to stop.


Answer 2: it's ok, just try to get pregnant within 2 weeks if you are sure you can.

Answer 3: it may be best to get married on a date that you think will last a long time.

Expected Response: hi when you say your cycle this means your menstrual cycle ovulation is just a 1 day thing and it happens mostly around day 14 give or take a day male sperm needs to be in place around 3 to 4 days before that day? its take male sperm 3 days to get in place to receive your egg either side so sperm splits up and goes to both ovary's and can live for up to 7 days if it gets there after day14 your probable safe. did you get spotting around day 21? but some times you may not notice this happen. good luck

Question: can you find out your pregnant in a week? . can you tell your pregnant in a week?
Baseline Response: If you are pregnant or in the process of becoming pregnant, you should be aware that you may need to take your own health care provider's advice. Your provider may advise you that you are not pregnant or you may not have adequate health care to meet your needs.
If your health care providers advise you to take a pregnancy test, they may need your consent to take it.
You may need urgent medical attention if you develop or develop severe bleeding from your cervix.
When your healthcare provider advises you that your pregnancy test is necessary to prevent pregnancy, you may want to talk with your doctor about your pregnancy before you decide whether to take the test.
Your doctor may be able to give you a recommendation about your needs and your doctor may also be able give you other information.
A pregnancy test may be required to provide you with information about your health

Baseline Response: i have a block of blood on my right side and my left side is blocked. i am pretty sure i have been a lot of pain and i feel like i am going to die from it.
Answer

Expected Response: as much as i would like to address your question there can be dozens of reasons why your period was shorter this time. it would really be impossible to offer you a specific reason without knowing your complete medical history and of course being able to examine you and run a few diagnostic tests. i suggest that you make an appointment with your women's health care specialist for a consultation so that you can be properly assessed.

Question: could you help me in this? . so i have cold which makes me cough. i had little orange juice in my mouth and i felt like coughing from cold so i took a deep breath and coughed once. do you think that some parts of orange juice might have gone the wrong way during this? i didn't feel like choking and i didn't cough more.
Baseline Response: I did cough but i didn�t cough as much as i should have because i didn`t feel like coughing. i was cold as hell but i didnt cough at all.
I think that when you have cold you start to get cold when you are cold. So i think that it might have been just my cold.
Is this what it is like to have cold?
Answer I think it is.

Expected Response: i think its may be because the orange juice touched a certain part that is inflaming and then the short cough appeared. it won't pose any potential diseases. - bms-754807

Baseline Response: triclosan is not a common illness in the U.S. and it is not even considered an illness by some.

Expected Response: trichomoniasis is sexually-transmitted so one or both of you had it. perhaps as long as a year or more. your risky sexual practices did not cause trich. it was contracted by contact with someone who had it not likely from sex toys or vaginal-anal sex (this can transmit colon bacteria to the vagina and cause a urinary tract infection or vaginitis). hi! partner in the last year but how many before? the trouble with tric is you can get and then it hide deep in tissue so it could be from a previous partner? you will only know many you have had that's not a put down nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite. but in future just go from vaginal to anal never back or the other way round. hope this helps you. good luck

Baseline Response: yes. Triamcinolol is an anti-microbial agent. It does not cause a yeast to become resistant to any of the antibiotics used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Triadamcin is used to treat bacterial infections that are resistant to many of the antimicrobials used in medicine, but it does not work as well as triamiquetine or amoxicillin.
Answer 1: triamcarnitin is a non-toxic drug used to prevent the growth of yeast. It is an antibiotic that does not bind to the skin. It can be used in combination with other antimicrobiological agents.

Expected Response: no this is a steroid cream. you need an anti-yeast medication available over-the-counter at the pharmacy. while mild steroids like hydrocortisone can help itching this steroid is a bit too strong for this sensitive area and can actually make a yeast infection worse so get the proper medication like monistat or a store-brand generic equivalent. your pharmacist can help you select one.

Baseline Response: can be either at the pharmacy, in the office, or online.
1. Can you take any of these over- the-counter medicines?
2. Can I take any over-counter medication at home?
3. Can we go to the pharmacy and buy over- and under-the counter medicines? If yes, can we take them from the pharmacy?
4. Can the over- counter medicines be taken by the pharmacy or by a licensed pharmacist?

6. Can my prescription medicines be over- or under-countered at home, at the office or in another location?
7. Can an over- on-counter medicine be taken on the same day as an over on-the edge medication?

Question: think my girlfriend is using drugs. not sure what thiugh. symptoms listed below. my girlfroend has the following symptoms; yellow in the eyes acne in random places/red bumps in areas like wrist face chest shoulders back butt and upper thighs as well as a ton of what she says are ingrown hairs on thighs and armpits constant fatigue lower back pain constantly rubbing eyebrows very slowly with eyes jumbled speech decreased appetite weight loss. swings vaginal discharge dark urine hair loss always horny.
Baseline Response: I have had the following issues with my girlfriend (and her boyfriend) since we first met in high school. She is a really good person and loves to talk about things that she's been through. She loves to help people and she's very supportive and nice. I have a hard time finding any kind of help for her. I am not sure if she would like to go back to school, but she is very supportive. I would recommend her to any friends or people

Expected Response: a lot the symptoms listed in your question do not seem related to inappropriate drug usage. perhaps you can tell your girlfriend about your observations do not accuse her of drug usage. instead describe what you see and offer to help her to see a doctor to be medically assessed. tell her that you care about her health and her happiness. offer to pay for the visit and to go with her for support. most physicians are pretty savvy about detecting drug abuse and will not hesitate to have a frank discussion about the dangers and rehabilitation. on the other hand she may have underling medical problems that can be established by the doctor. if you truly care about the well being of this lady please consider taking the above actions.

Question: does taking beta blockers affect heart rate during exercise?
Baseline Response: yes, you can. The most common effect of beta blockers is to increase blood pressure, which can be increased by taking them. The best way to increase your blood pressure is to take a blood pressure test.
1. The following are the most common ways to increase the blood pressure of a person taking beta-blockers:
1) Take an insulin-like growth hormone (IGF-1) pill. This pill is called a beta blocker.
2) Take oral beta blockers for a couple weeks. This will increase your insulin sensitivity.
3) Take beta blockers to help you lose weight.
4) Take a beta-blocking pill to reduce your blood sugar.
5) Take your insulin pills daily.
6) Take insulin pills to control your blood glucose levels.
7) Take the beta blocker to control blood sugar levels. You will need to take beta blockers every day for a year

Expected Response: beta blockers will slow your heart rate. therefore when you're swimming or doing any kind of physical activity or exertion your heart rate will not increase much as it did when you were off the meds. it's a whole different experience. now that shouldn't stop you from doing your activities. you just cannot use the heart rate range rules to see if you're getting the caloric or fat burn you want. or if you're an athlete on a beta blocker the same holds. you can't use your heart rate to determine your overall activity efficiency or performance.

Question: i've been having a pain in my chest it comes and goes. should i be concerned? . i have had the pain off and on for a few hours. it feels like a stabbing pain that last a few minuets then goes away. what could cause this?
Baseline Response: i have been having the pain from my chest pain since about 6am on the 20th of May. i have a pretty big hole in my left leg and it's getting worse and worse. i've had a few bad cuts and it was getting worse the day after i got this pain. i'm going to have to go to my GP and see if they can treat me.

Question: how early can you tell gender? . using a 3d ultrasound how early can you tell the gender of your baby? can you tell at 6 weeks along?
Baseline Response: how late can you start a baby and what can be done about it?
Solution: you can start at 6 months along. You can start with your baby in a crib with your hands and not even your head. You will be able to look at the baby and see how much they are breathing, how much of their body is moving, and how much their skin is growing. This will help you to know when the baby is ready to be born.
Solution 2: how often can I start a new baby?
How often can you take your baby to see a doctor.
Answer : not only can you see your baby through the first couple weeks but you can also see them through the last couple weeks.
Your baby is very small and needs a good baby diaper. The only way to get

Expected Response: as soon as you can be 100% sure of gender is when they are born. before that you do have to rely on the skill and experience of the ultrasound technician. six weeks is a little early to offer a definitive answer (we used to affectionately call this "weiner hunting") so be patient. your baby will either be a boy or a girl. there is nothing you can do to change it now.

Question: at what point is strenious and stressfull work too much during pregnancy? . i am approximately 7 weeks along. my job is pretty intense as it can at times be 10+ hour days. standing lifting and full sun all day as well as a lot of stress involved.

I love my job, but it is a little daunting at times. I think that's why I can't work full time. I work from work, so I can work on my own. I'm happy to do what I love, but at times I get really stressed out and think I can do better. I hope this helps you.
So, how do you get into the fitness world?
Answer 1. You need to find your

Question: my breathing (asthma) has sharply worsened since an office renovation. what is the recommended treatment?
Baseline Response: The recommended treatment is to have an immediate cessation of all the breathing problems. This is a common cause of breathing problems in the practice of yoga.
The recommended treatment should be a temporary cessation of breathing and an immediate return to normal. This can be done within a few days after the cessation of the breathing problem.
What is the best way to help people with breathing problems?
The best way is to practice with a qualified practitioner.
How do I find out if my breathing problems are due to breathing problems or just my own breathing problems
Answer : If your breathing problem is due to something other than breathing problems, you should ask the practitioner for help with your breathing problems and they can help you resolve the problem. You can even talk to the practitioner to try to help you.
If you have any problems that you think are related to your breathing difficulties,

Expected Response: strong odors from new paint and particulates from construction dust can irritate the airway leading to an increase in symptoms. patients sometimes need an adjustment to their asthma and nasal regimens until these irritants settle down. i would visit with your doctor about your symptoms so they can be better managed. in many cases after awhile the increase in therapy can be switched back to your regular routine. if you experience nasal congestion from the exposures a trial of prescription nasal atrovent may also be beneficial.

Question: enlarged prostate. what is the treatment for an enlarged prostate?
Baseline Response: It is best to have a prostate test, which is a diagnostic test that you can use to test for prostate cancer.
The test is a combination of a urine sample and a urine test. The test is very good, but the test is not really necessary.
This is because the test has no sensitivity to urine.
If you have a normal urine sample, you can get a normal test with a normal prostate test.
But if you have enlarged prostate, it is very difficult to get a urine, so you have to have your own urine test and have it done.
What is the test for?
The tests are very good and the test does not have a sensitivity to the urine. The tests are also very good in people with a history of prostate cancer, because they are very sensitive to the skin, and they don't have to do any tests.
How do you get a test

Expected Response: hi do look up about tuna and it works i do know one guy who has had it done wish's he had had it done years ago gave him and his wife there sex life back and some women do love there sex lives. found you this link from the mayo clinic should help you. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read do hope this helps and you far better than turps. good luck

Question: can i become dependent on halcion?
Baseline Response: yes, but only if you have the right to do so.

Expected Response: halcion is a medication that has been used in the past to treat insomnia and you can become dependent on it. it has a special code on it which means that there are special laws that the pharmacist has to follow and the doctor has to follow when they write for something like this. as far as dependency how do we judge what dependency really means? dependency would mean that if you stop taking the medication you would experience withdrawal effects which means that you would be -- maybe have the shakes. this particular medication doctors need to monitor closely to make sure that you are not on it all the time. a lot of people are on it for maybe 7-14 days. so it shouldn't be something that should be prescribed every single day every single night for a longer period of time. there are newer medications like lunesta like ambien that have better medication profiles as far as side effects. we would rather see you on something like that instead because of the fact that they have decrease side effects. won't make you as tired won't cause falls in the home; especially for the elderly patient halcion we really don't want to use that drug because it has been shown that they can fall out of bed sometimes on it. so once again we have got to be really carefully about the choices that we make and once again talk to your pharmacist about concerns questions side effects and possibly we would refer you back to your physician or healthcare provider. for instance if you find a medication that works for you and you don't have as many side effects that's the key. that's what we want to do. we want to make sure that you are having the best quality of life.

Question: pain upper right side abdom and back w naus freq urina no vom no fever no gallbladder. on ibs pain meds daily. appendix?
Baseline Response: I have never been able to read a prescription for a pain reliever and I can't help but feel a bit sorry for them. It's not like I've ever given them anything to write about. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry I'm not the one that will. I don't know how to explain this to you, but I am. I know what I'm doing. I am sorry.

Expected Response: sooboob. i've got the same symptoms & spent a week in one hospital & a week later a week at another hospital while dr. s were trying to figure out what was causing the extreme nausea that was sooo forceful it made me dry heave but never a true vomiting. the only thing they found after extensive examining with every kind of mri ultrasound ct scan & lab u can think of. was a golfball size tumor in the center of my liver. i've read several threads of people with tumors in their liver that claim to have the same symptoms & their dr. would never attribute the symptoms to the tumor. i had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago & started having the nausea april of last yr & the pain started as an occasional pain. similar to the gallbladder pain but grew in intensity & frequency over a several month period. i'm a woman & notice that the pain is at it's peek a week before my cycle starts (pms) & during my cycle then it subsides to tolerable & the nausea increases to intolerable. they take turns ruining my day lol. hope this isn't what's wrong with u but your symptoms are the same as mine & all the dr's i've seen are too eager to hand me the ibs med & nexium. however the meds make the pain worse.

Question: will eating turkey help me sleep?
Baseline Response: no. I've had turkey for a week now and my sleep is excellent. I was also having a problem with my sleep, which is that my body gets tired too quickly. I have a lot of sleep problems, and it's a really good thing that I have turkey. I'm very happy that I ate it, and I'm not worried about what happens next.
Answer 1: I do like turkey.
The best thing about turkey is that it's great for you. It's a great food, and you can take it anywhere. I like it in a turkey salad and in a sauce pan, and sometimes in a soup. It also makes me feel like I'm getting a little more energy, which I think is good. I don't like to eat turkey at night. I eat turkey because I like to sleep.
It's good for you too, because I have trouble sleeping and I can't make sleep

Expected Response: well there’s a big myth about turkey okay so turkey does have l-tryptophan in it. you’d have to eat about a 46 pound turkey to get enough tryptophan in your system to for it to make a difference and the truth of the matter is that tryptophan doesn’t work particularly well in the presence of protein. so it doesn’t really work. there’s just as much tryptophan in beef and pork so if you eat a big thanksgiving meal it’s not what’s making you sleepy is not the turkey. it’s probably the preparations and the lack of sleep you got the night before getting the meal ready that’s actually making you tired.

Question: want to know side effects of facedown mastrubation. i have been doing face down masturbation since i am 14 now i am 28 recently i came to know about facedown mastrubation it can cause dangerous side affects and it is not usual pattern of mastrubation request if some one can give me the details on this till now i haven't tried for an intercourse as i am not married yet. will there be any problem in intercourse because of this way of mastrubation? will it lead to impotency?
Baseline Response: - The main one is that you will have to be very careful when you faceown and not face down.
I am married and i have to go to a doctor if I want to have this

Expected Response: there are no "side effects" (like impotency) from masturbation. face down face up face sideways or hanging upside down. i began masturbating as a small child. i didn't know anybody else did it but decided it was wrong and kept trying to stop! anyhow i did it lying on my stomach and it was many years before i read that doing it that way could be bad for one but i don't remember why unless it was too much pressure on the penis. eventually i learned that masturbation in general was not only not immoral depending on the circumstances but it took me a long time to learn to do it lying on my back but it was something i rarely did until after my wife died. hi the problem by ding this is when it comes to real sex you may not have the sensitivity that you should have this stems from dry masturbating and dry masturbating is not good for you you could end up with scars on your gland so take a break for a couple of weeks the start masturbating with some kind of oil baby oil will do the using you hand start masturbating slowly with a featherlight touch not a hard grip masturbating should have the same touch as the inside if a vagina this way when it comes to real sex your brain will know just how it should feel. good luck usually when masturbating the only side effect is stomach cramp

Question: as an asthmatic taking the bus a lot i'm around 2nd hand smoke so much that my asthma is worsening. mask recommendation. i want to know if there is a mask i can wear while waiting for the bus when i can't get away from smokers. i went online searching and couldn't find anything. all the websites i visited said it was impossible to really filter the cigarette smoke completely. so is there a mask that will do a fairly good job? maybe i can wear two of those masks at the same time to better help myself. thank you.
Baseline Response: i was hoping that the smoke would not cause any irritation, but i couldn't quite get it to stick to my skin. I can't find any good mask for that.

Expected Response: i wear a 3m 8210 respirator n95 mask. have used it when i was a painter and also working on the farm in all the dust. also have sometimes put a damp kleenex inside it for further relief.

Question: can having a mammogram and a bone density test on the same day cause hair loss?

Question: what level of spf should one use on a daily basis?
Baseline Response: this is a question that we can't answer, but it is a very important one.
The first question is: what are the actual benefits of spafing?
We've discussed this in the previous post. In the first post, we discussed how to spf to the point of being able to do it in the short term. In this post, I'm going to talk about how to do this in an ideal situation.
A good example of an ideal spf situation is a typical restaurant or restaurant-run business. I'll discuss some of the benefits of a typical spf, and then I'll go over the pros and cons of spfs.
Pros: Spf is a great option when you're dealing with a business that requires a lot of spfing. The cost of sparfing is low, and it's very easy to get a good spf.
Cons

Expected Response: you should use a minimum spf a 15 but even more importantly than that you can even go higher to a 30 or up to a 50. i think beyond that it doesn't make much difference. but the most important thing is to reapply it every few hours because whether or not you are out there swimming sweating or rubbing it off it wears off over time and it gets degraded by the sun exposure itself. so you have to apply enough product but also reapply it often enough in order to maintain that protection. don't forget to put it on your neck and your chest because those are areas that are exposed. if you are wearing a scoop neck or a v-neck and you are just walking around it's incidental sun exposure. the sun exposure is cumulative. your skin remembers that first exposure as a child and that's been building up building up building up in your skin and eventually it crosses a threshold when you hit your; it could be in your 20s 30s 40s or beyond depending on your skin type and how much exposure you have had where all of a sudden it starts to show. both as signs of aging and even worse signs of skin cancer.

Question: lower back pain be a sign of pregnancy? my lower right side of my back right above my hip. it is a constant dull pain but with sharp intense bursts periodically. i am a day late on my period right now took a test that showed negative. could i still be pregnant?
Baseline Response: It is the only way to have a good birth.
Answer 1: If you are a woman who has a low back pain, you must have a low spine, lower back, or hip pain. This is a major health problem.

Expected Response: yes its always possible if you had unprotected sex and your late you could be they say its not always a sure thing to take a hpt the first day of your peroid tests like clear blue are normaly on the money cramping can be from the egg attaching itself inside you. i would say try another test in a few days see what that tells you if still a neg. call you gyn and let her know and im sure she can tell you if its something to worry about. also bare in mind that if you did have sex and your having pain in your side you could be having a tube pregnancy which means the egg has attached itself to you tube rather than making its way into where it belongs and that can be a very bad thing so like i siad hold off a few days but if the pain worsens call your doctor asap hope this helps

Baseline Response: when i do a squat or bench i feel like my feet are numb. i have a sore hip joint.
Solution: i do not have a weak back or

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. pain issues can negatively impact a person's quality of life and in your case you've had to reduce your running because of it. if it's been a year since you last saw the doctor about this it's time to go back. for one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel. for another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it re-checked. many conditions can cause the pains you've described. anything from sciatica to worn cartilage in the joints to arthritis could be the culprit. if you don't feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion. i wish you all the best!

Question: how to get rid of the poison ivy rashes? . although i thought i was being careful when cutting down some poison ivy in by backyard i now have it. itching is under control but can anyone help on getting rid of the rashes or do i just wait it out? got it 5 days ago. it is also spreading to my surprise. i read that it would only spread from the original toxic oils from the plant not after exposure. i'm not even very itchy but every day have a new patch of rashes.
Baseline Response: i have been doing this for the past 3 years. i've been using an herbicide called Proton, which is a non-toxic herbicide that kills all the plants in your yard. i do not have a problem with this herbicide. i have also been using a chemical called bicarbonate which is very toxic. i like to use the chemical as a way to prevent this from happening to me. i

Expected Response: you are correct about it appearing to spread based on your original exposure. you may have been exposed by the oils on your clothing or shoes that you touched later or by some of the tools you used to cut it down. the oleoresin is so stable that it can last on objects for years so you better carefully wash any clothing or objects that may have become contaminated. if you have a dog and dog came in contact with poison ivy the oil can be on the fur so wash the dog too. in my opinion there is no such thing as a mild case of poison ivy so i tend to treat them more aggressively (based on my own childhood experience of the misery it causes). prescription prednisone topical steroids and oral antihistamines is the treatment of choice so it is time to consult a medical provider.

Question: what is consider a diabete if your have low sugar level to be 44 then goes up to 67
Baseline Response: that is the percentage of sugar in your blood. You can also measure your insulin level.
The first part of the diabet is called a blood sugar level. If you have low blood sugar then your blood sugar will rise slightly. If your blood glucose is low then your insulin levels will rise.
In this case you have a diabetic high blood sugar. If that is not your diabetic blood sugar it is a diabetes level. In the case of diabetes you will get a lower blood sugar than your normal blood sugar when you get a high blood glucose.
When you get diabetes you have insulin levels that go up. This is called the glucose tolerance test. This test tells you what you are capable of doing. It is very important to remember that the level of insulin you have is usually just as important as your blood sugars.
What you can do

Expected Response: to diagnose diabetes your doctor may do a fasting blood glucose test. this is a preferred method since it’s easy to do and less expensive than other tests but you have to refrain from eating anything for at least 8 hours priors to testing. also it is normal for your blood sugar to go up after eating. fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 99mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 100 – 125mg/dl diabetic – greater than 126mg/dl non-fasting blood glucose values: low – less than 70mg/dl normal - between 70 to 139mg/dl pre-diabetic – between 140 – 199mg/dl diabetic – greater than 200mg/dl the standard diagnosis of diabetes is made when at least two separate blood tests show that your blood sugar is elevated. based on the information you provided it appears that you have a low blood glucose value. i would actually review this article about hypoglycemia or low blood sugar ( <link> ) since your blood sugar was initially very low on this occasion. keep in mind that even a normal blood glucose test with risk factors (listed here: <link> ) may warrant further testing. it would be best to discuss with your doctor if you have further questions.

Question: what are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes recently diagnosed?
Baseline Response: Type 1 diabetes is a very common type of diabetes. It is a common disease of the pancreas, which is a normal part of the body. Type 1 is diagnosed when the body becomes too small for the pancrea to form a proper pancreate. The body can't maintain a proper body temperature. The pancreae is one of the most important organs of the brain. The brain is the body's most important organ. It has many functions, including understanding, regulating, and controlling glucose levels. There are many other parts of the human body, such as the eyes, the heart, and the liver. The human body is the most complex organ in the body, and it has many different functions.
Type 1 diabetes usually begins in the heart. The heart is the heart's most complex part. It pumps blood to the heart through the blood vessels. It also pumps oxygen into the body through the

Expected Response: your (or your child's) symptoms of type 1 diabetes probably developed quickly over a few days to weeks. these symptoms are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia) and include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. if your child has already learned to use the toilet he or she may have started wetting the bed during naps or at night. the kidneys are trying to get rid of the excess sugar in the blood. in order to do that they have to excrete more water. more water means more urine. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. this happens if you lose through frequent urination enough water to become dehydrated. weight loss. this happens because you are dehydrated. weight loss may also happen if you are losing all of those sugar calories in your urine instead of using them. increased hunger. you feel hungry because your body is not using all the calories that it can. many of them are being excreted in urine. blurred vision. your vision may blur when sugar builds up in the lens of your eye. the sugar sucks extra water into your eye which changes the shape of the lens and blurs your vision. fatigue. you feel tired for the same reason you feel hungry. your body is not using the calories you are eating and your body is not getting the energy it needs. all of these symptoms will get better or go away when your blood sugar levels are controlled. if your blood sugar rose to very high levels at the time you were diagnosed with diabetes you may have received treatment in a hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis which is an emergency. what symptoms might i have now? now that you are taking insulin injections watch for signs of either high or low blood sugar. high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) usually develops slowly over a few days or weeks. but it can also develop quickly (in just a few hours) if you eat a large meal or miss an insulin dose. on the other hand low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) can develop within 10 to 15 minutes. children especially very young children are at greater risk for harm caused by very low blood sugar levels. watch for the following symptoms of high or low blood sugar. you (or your child) may not have the same symptoms every time and you may have symptoms that are not listed. symptoms of low blood sugar include sweating weakness and inability to concentrate. severe low blood sugar can cause loss of consciousness and seizures. symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst and increased urination. signs of high or low blood sugar in young children can be confusing but may include paleness and a sudden change in emotion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: while playing baseball i was struck just above the knot in my ankle. could there be a hairline fracture? . i'm now at six days with a goose egg on my lower leg and a contusion just under my ankle with discomfort/tightness.
Baseline Response: The goose egg is the same thing as the injury itself. The fact that the goose egg appears to be in my leg is not the same as the fact that it is in my shoulder. The injury is the result of the tendon that is in the lower thigh.

Expected Response: it may be a non-displaced fracture that could be seen on plain x-ray. you can get this at your local physician's office. if the x-ray is normal you can consider it being a hematoma that can take a couple of weeks to resorb.
================================================================================
Question: how do i know if i qualify for a subsidy in the health insurance exchanges?
Baseline Response: You can find information about the eligibility requirements for the exchanges and how to apply for one by clicking here.

Expected Response: if you earn between 100-400% of the federal poverty level (fpl) you are eligible for a subsidy on the exchange. in 2013 the fpl is $11 490 for one person and $23 550 for a family of four. if you are unsure if you qualify it is still simple to find out. the application for health insurance on your state’s health insurance exchange will calculate your eligibility for you. simply visit your state’s exchange website when enrollment begins on october 1 2013. if you are ineligible for subsidies on the exchange because you qualify for medicare or medicaid the health insurance exchange will enroll you into the appropriate program. in this sense it is designed to be a one-stop shop with “no wrong door. ”

Question: can you have an all over headache after having a panic or anxiety attack?
Baseline Response: no, your headache will be as severe as the symptoms of panic. In fact, it will be worse in the worst cases than it is in the best cases.
1. The first thing to do is to seek a doctor for a migraine.
2. The best way to go about getting a migraine is to try to get a doctor's opinion on it. If you have a migraine, you need to seek medical advice.
3. If the migraine is so severe, it is very likely that it will not be treated, or that you will not get help for it.
4. If your doctor doesn't know how to get you a migraine and you have not been given an accurate diagnosis of it, you may need to consult your doctor for help.
5. If an all-in-one solution is not available for you, you can try an all in one solution

Expected Response: tension-type headaches would not be uncommon after an anxiety or panic attack. anxiety can cause whole-body responses; not just headaches but neckaches backaches nausea upset stomach diarrhea elevated blood pressure and many other stress-like reactions. i have chronic migrains and i have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. when i get anxious i almost always get a migraine and i visibly shake for a number of hours.

Question: if i had unprotected sex and then got my period three days later could i still be pregnant? . the condom we were using broke and we didn't notice and then i got my period three days later. i know that you don't get your period when you are pregnant but since three days is so soon after would my body still be able to tell that early?
Baseline Response: yes, but only if your body has no time to heal. If your body is doing just fine after 3 days of unprotected sex, then you can only get your body healed by having your body heal.
A: It is also important to note that you cannot get your periods from unprotected sex. Your body doesn't want to hurt you or your baby, so you can't get it.

Expected Response: hi to this the book goes two ways one says no the other says some women can get pregnant from having unprotected sex any time of the month even if just before a period. sorry you will need to wait see if you get your next period if you miss it then would be the time for a test. hope this helps. good luck

Question: can u still breast feed with yeast on your breast?
Baseline Response: yes, but it's not necessary.
Why should you breastfeed with yeast?
Because you can get a yeast infection.
You might want to avoid any yeast infection that may have come from your breast, because this can cause problems with your milk, and you may also be at risk of bacteria from the yeast that are present.
If you are breastfeeding, do not breastfeed as you may get a bacterial infection. Your milk will not be sterile.
Keep in mind that you may need to give your milk to the yeast to prevent infection. If you are not breastfeeding, you may not be able to breastfeed.
This is the second time you have been breastfed.
How can I prevent yeast infection with my breast?


Step 1: Prepare your milk for breast feeding

1. Take the lactose in your milk. You will find a bottle of this in your refrigerator

Expected Response: yes but you should be using a prescribed anti-yeast medication. i often recommend the same prescription medication i would treat a baby with oral thrush (also yeast). ask your medical provider or the baby's pediatrician to prescribe it for you.
================================================================================
Question: can drinking wine on a daily basis cause yeast infections which lead to a rash in my armpits?

Question: is there a generic drug for erectile dysfunction?
Baseline Response: there is. I have used it for over 30 years and it is not a medication that I would use for erections. I do not think it is a specific drug. I believe it is an "artificial" form of medication that has been used in the past. The first time I used it, I felt that it was the best one for my problem. I was worried about the side effects and didn't know if it would be the best for me. Now, I am a little more confident that it is the best medication for my problems.

Expected Response: the three most common medications for erectile dysfunction are viagra cialis and levitra. there are currently no generic versions of any of them.

Question: we had sex i came pulled out after condom was still inside so pulled it out too. got plan b. chance of pregnancy? . so just to elaborate we had sex (used a condom) as i said. after i came i pulled out and noticed that the condom was still inside so i reached in and pulled it out. afterwards we went and got plan b and she took it within 2-3 hours at most. what is the chance of pregnancy in this situation? thank you.
Baseline Response: we did not have sex until after we had already used condoms. so if you were planning on having sex, you had to get a condom. we used a condom for our first time and then it was still outside. it was a very long time after that. so i think we were pretty safe in the long run.
Source: Astrid
The most common reason why we did NOT use condoms was that we had a very small amount of blood in the condom. if

Expected Response: hi if things go to plan with plan b she should be ok but end of the day she will have to wait till she gets her period but do remember it has now moved because of plan b as this brings on a period so this is her new start date and she now times it from there ok good luck

Question: my boyfriend and i had sex using both the pill and a condom. the condom broke. should i worry about rubber inside me? . we think most stayed on his shaft and i found a small piece about 3/4 inch x 1/2 inch. like it ripped and a portion tore off. do i have to worry about this causing tss? .
Baseline Response: no.

Expected Response: no you will not get tss from a piece of condom (most likely latex not rubber). if there is a retained piece it will not likely cause any problems but you can carefully check with your finger or use a gentle warm water douche to wash out any possible remnants.
================================================================================
Question: what foods should i avoice for meneire's disease? . my doctor told me to eat a "no salt chocolate wine cheese and caffeine diet (a migraine diet? ). can you provide me with an established diet that avoids triggers for meniere's?
Baseline Response: no, it's not clear.
1. "How do I know what foods to eat for men's disease?"
2. "What are the best foods for men?".
3. "I don't know what the best food is for men, what are the worst foods for women?"
Answer. I don't have any information about what the optimal diet for men is.
4. "If I can't make sure that I can make sure I'm not eating anything that is bad for me, how do I make sure my body doesn't get sick from that?"
5. "Can I get a free sample of my diet for women and men to look at?"
6.

Expected Response: the mainstay of a diet for menieres is low sodium typically under 2000mg daily. that means focusing on whole foods that naturally have less sodium over processed foods with sodium added. these foods include fruits vegetables whole grains unprocessed meats and healthy fats. when choosing other items read the label. this list should help you figure out low sodium choices. it's also beneficial to limit caffeine in items like coffee tea and soda. these are other foods high in caffeine. i think the cheese and wine has to do with migraines and not menieres so you'll have to check with your doctor on that. i would focus on sodium first. good luck!

Baseline Response: I am not sure how many tablets the dentist will give. I am sure the dentist can give as many as you wish. I have been told it is too small. My son has been having eczemesis and he has been taking the tablets. I also have no

Expected Response: it makes a lot of sense. it's another non drowsy medication that works to reduce the allergic response over the long term and the 5 milligram chewable is the children's dose. though it's also used to control asthma it is very useful for allergies. here's more information: <link>

Question: how long does a rash last. had a rash all around my mouth for 6 weeks ( just like a go-tee) and nothing is helping hydroclorasone eucerine etc. now it's under one eye and eyelid. the doctor told me it was a rash . it doesn't really itch but it gets quite red and lightens up from time to time. another doc said infection bacteria or fungal. tried anti baceria and fungal cremes to no avail. heeeeeeeeelp!
Baseline Response: it's a fungal infection so I think you have to be careful of this. the bacteria can be pretty hard to detect and you'll need to know what you're dealing with.
Answer 1:
A lot of people don't know the difference between a herpes simplex infection and herpes simpleptosis. A herpes simpletosis is a bacteria that can spread to your mouth and eventually get into your bloodstream. The bacteria cause the

Expected Response: it would be impossible to predict the outcome of a skin eruption since every person is different when it comes to healing times. additionally it appears that you have not been definitively diagnosed so seeing a dermatologist at this point would be prudent. a "rash" is a very very vague diagnosis. there are thousands of causes so after six weeks of treatment failure i think you need to see a specialist.
================================================================================
Question: how is lymphedema diagnosed?
Baseline Response: lymphes are usually diagnosed in the middle of the night, when there is a low blood pressure.
Lymphede is a very common condition that occurs when there are symptoms of low blood sugar. It is usually caused by a combination of a number of things, including:
A low blood potassium level
A high blood glucose level
Low blood sugar
A blood sugar spike
Low cholesterol
Low levels of LDL
Low HDL
Low triglycerides
Low high blood pressure
Low low blood cholesterol
The most common type of lymphenema is a type of hypospadias, or low blood glucose. The symptoms usually come in the morning, when the blood sugar is low. It may be the result of a low potassium level, low potassium concentration, or a combination.
Hypospadia is often a mild condition. However, it can be severe and sometimes fatal.
If you have ly

Expected Response: lymphedema is diagnosed after a careful evaluation of your medical history including past surgeries and treatments an evaluation of current medications and symptoms and a complete physical examination. sometimes additional tests may be needed.

Question: what can you put on bites from fire ants?
Baseline Response: it's a lot of fun to play with.
One of the most important things to know about fire ants is that they're not just there for food. They're there to eat.
They are actually quite active in their own way, and they're often seen feeding on other ants as well.
The first time I saw one of these ants, I had to be careful not to get my hands into the nest. It was so hard to get away from the fire ants.
I was able to get up to 10 ants out of the nest and I knew they were there for me. I knew that I had a good chance of winning. I was not going to let it go.
This is an excellent way to start your game.
Another important thing to know is that these ants are not only there to protect you. They also help you get the ants on the right side of your face.

Expected Response: if you have been stung by a fire ant you should softly wash the skin with a mixture of soap and water; this will get rid of the venom on the surface. if you have rubbing alcohol around you also should disinfect the area of the bites. you can then put some ice in a washcloth and hold it next to the bites for about 15-20 minutes. that will help keep down swelling and make it a little less irritating the next day. fire ant stings are also accompanied by a lot of itching so you may want to use a hydrocortisone or diphenhydramine-based cream. be careful and don't scratch! this could lead to secondary skin infections a trip to the doctor and possibly antibiotic treatment.

Question: what does it mean when there is a red blotch on your scrotum? . hello i am a 16 year old male and just recently found a red blotch on my scrotum it isn't itchy and it is always moist i am not sure if the moisture is puss or sweat i think it might be some fungal infection or just jock rash but can someone tell me what i might have?
Baseline Response: it means that the scrotal tissue is growing out of the skin. I have been using this method for years and i have never seen anything like it. It is usually done by applying a wet cloth to your scintilla and then putting it back on after a few hours.
Answer, there is no such thing as "white" scrot. It means that it is not a brown or red blotchy area.

Expected Response: most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal "red blotch". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated.

Question: what is the best time of day to exercise to lose weight? specifically if i'm walking on a treadmill.
Baseline Response: I usually go to the gym at 8 AM. I don't do any cardio.

Question: new vein formation under penis head. i frequently clamp my penis at the base as a form of exercise and recently the clamp was a little too hard. the next day i developed a vein like formation below the head and around the shaft more prominent around the sides. there is very slight discomfort but no pain. it has now been 6 days but the bump still persists. what can this be? it it some kind of lymph fluid build up and do i need to be alarmed?
Baseline Response: i do not have a problem with this vein formation. it is not painful at all. it just makes the problem worse.
Answer 2: I have never seen a doctor report any kind of vein formation in this vein. I have seen the same vein shape and it was just a little bit bigger.
I have never had a vein formed in my penis, and I have had it happen to me in my last 6 years. I believe the reason for the vein formation is that the growth in

Question: had a tubal ligation in 2010 is it possible that i can get pregnant. what is meant if the surgery is done correctly in one of 2 ways? what does this mean
Baseline Response: it means that you can get a tubeloscopy if you have a condition like cystic fibrosis, or if you can't get a hysterectomy. If you have cystic aortic aneurysms, you can go to your local hospital for a hystatectomy. If your condition doesn't work out, you should be able to get a cystic aneurymis.


Cultivate the hystric, or you can have it done in a small, non-intrusive, non invasive way.

 (I have no idea what the word "sexy" means, or why you would want to do a cystectomy.)


What is a hysterectomy?


A hystrocyte is

Expected Response: hi here is the answer you want. tubal ligation or tubectomy (also known as having one's "tubes tied" ( ligation )) is a surgical procedure for sterilization in which a woman's fallopian tubes are clamped and blocked or severed and sealed either method of which prevents eggs from reaching the uterus for implantation. see two ways of doing the same operation. hope its helpful. good luck anymore questions just come back through answer this above

Question: can shingles rash spread? . diagnosed as having shingles. i have had a rash/blisters on left arm been on antibiotics for 7 days. two days ago my right leg near my knee started burning itching and sure enough today i have a swollen hot rash and my leg hurts a lot. any thoughts?
Baseline Response: It's a common skin condition that has been found in patients who have had shingling. It's not a very serious condition and it's not even a very common disease. There are many different types of skin conditions that can cause skin diseases such as psoriasis, psorosis, and sunburn. The reason for the skin disease is due to the fact that the skin is usually exposed to ultraviolet light and the skin cells are constantly exposed to this light. As a result of this exposure the skin can become very sensitive to light, which can cause it to become irritated and blistering. It is important to note that if your skin is

Question: if my grandkids got chickenpox and i already had it can i go to work and not infect people i work in food service
Baseline Response: if your grandkids get chickenpox you have to get a vaccine for it. If your grandchild gets measles and if your baby gets measles, you have a vaccine. If you have the vaccine you have immunity.
Answer 2: If you're a big family, don't worry about your grand.

Expected Response: exposure to infectious diseases like chicken pox does not mean that you can spread it to others. you would actually need to have chicken pox yourself in order to do that. chicken pox re-exposure can cause you to get shingles but that would be a different question. your co-workers in food service will not be at risk.

Question: i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.
Baseline Response: it is.
i am not sure if this is due to cold or due to any other causes. i am a regular person with a mild to moderate allergy to hot or cold. i have had no serious problems with this condition. i did have a few minor complications and i am very happy with my health and health is fine.
I am not a medical professional or doctor. I am just a person who loves to read, eat and exercise. I have had some serious issues with my body. My skin

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this and that it's concerning you. the skin is an amazing organ. one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin's surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm. this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing (a red appearance) and may make the skin feel hot. the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core. i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday? is it because you're exercising for example? are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes? or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day? our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you're getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit. i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally (your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat) but perhaps there's some underlying cause for this that should be checked out. i wish you all the best with this! i have a question for you. do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring? the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating. over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i don't. the heat is trapped inside. not being able to sweat is known as "anhidrosis" research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue. i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways. hope this helps. this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call "empty heat" or "empty fire" "the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general (irrespective of organ) are: - a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening - a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips - malar flush (red cheekbones) - a dry throat at night - a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called a5-palm heat@) - dry stools - scanty-dark urine - a floating-empty and rapid pulse - a red tongue without coating. " <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body. see the url above for more information. western medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms. i would recommend seeing a competent traditional chinese medical doctor in your area preferably one with the degree omd (orental medical doctor) a traditional chinese medical doctor not just a licensed acupuncturist. (the difference can be more that 5 years of study and clinical education) hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last 4 months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normal. i finally found the cure in an unlikely place. i have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad 4 months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctor(ayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda <link> so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathic(mainstream) medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda it's called ushna(heat) and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for 40 days but just today being the third day i am already feelin 60% better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddha(<link> doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isn't one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at <link> they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country. hope you'll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it. hello friends i had similar problem since almost 10 years. i am m/30 years now. my normal body temperature when i was not feeling feverish would be about 96. 8 f (almost 2 degree fahrenheit lesser than normal). when i am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about 97. ish rarely reaching 98. no doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesn't show up on thermometer. however strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not. i would feel feverish with chills. i would have episodes of feverish feeling every 2 months or so and every time it would last for a 2-3 weeks. doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful. i do not have thyroid or any other deficiency however i have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease as well. the reason i write this time is because something miraculous happened this and i would want others' opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well. this might very well be a cure: treatment: day1: take 500mg paracetamol. after 30 mins take vitamin c + zinc supplement day2: continue vitamin c+ zinc daily for next few days. i got fantastic relief on day 2 onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to 96. 9ish j waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery.

Question: do people who smoke meth have parasites worms present in their bodies if so how do you get rid of them?
Baseline Response: you can't. Your body is not like a virus. It is not capable of infecting you. It has no capacity to grow or grow. It doesn't have a host. It just gets out of the body.
When I'm on meth, I use a very small amount of it. I don't have any parasites. I just have this tiny little virus that lives inside of me. I'm really lucky.
It doesn't go to the liver. It goes to the kidneys. It does not get into your body. It's a virus, but it's not really a virus at all. It comes in from the lungs.
What it does do is it makes your liver go to waste. It makes your body think you're dead.
You can't get rid. The parasite worms are there.
In my case, I

Expected Response: no meth users do not have parasitic worms; they just think they do. meth users will "tweak". pick at their skin pick and scratch until their bodies look terrible.

Question: a cat scan showed that i have a fatty liver. what can i do to change my lifestyle to resolve the situation? . i know that the right side under my right lower ribs has been painful (like pressure against the ribs) for the last year i am overweight (i'm 200 lbs at 5'6") and 62 years old female. i really want to lose weight learn to eat healthier and try to stop the fat from accumulating. is this possible and what kind of diet should i be following? i also have hypothyroidism and am on synthyroid. . thank you. carol
Baseline Response: i have diabetes, am in a family with a high cholesterol, and i am on a low carb diet. is it possible that i would have a high level of cholesterol in my blood if i were to go to the doctor and give myself insulin to prevent the liver from passing over to the kidneys? .
Answer : i am not taking any drugs to prevent my liver

Expected Response: a fatty liver is reversible. being overweight is one of the many causes for this condition. lose some weight and lose some liver fat. hypothyroidism should not interfere with your losing weight objective. in order to maintain a weight of 200 pounds you're consuming about 1844 calories per day. to reduce your weight by one (1) pound per week reduce your daily calories to about 1344. here is my abbreviated version of a plan that will enable you to eat better and lose some of the excess weight. : - begin by seeing your family doctor and obtain approval to start a reduced calorie diet. eliminating 500 calories from your daily diet can be challenging but will also prove to be rewarding and is achievable. - search the web for free 1300 daily printable diet plans. look for one that includes at least seven (7) days of planning covering three (3) meals per day and snacks. some of these diet plans may even include a printable shopping list and recipes to complete the main courses for each meal. look for diets that use a safe breakdown of calories (55% carbs -15% protein- 30% fats). - drink at least 64 oz. of water each day. - with your doctor's approval start a modest exercise program. a brisk walk will burn about 100 calories per mile while gardening will burn an additional 100 calories in 30 minutes. - take steps to learn dieting do's and do not's. do not skip meals but do learn how to substitute one food for another and how to order a meal at the restaurant while not sabotaging your diet. - keep a diary of foods and beverages consumed along with a record of your weight losses. - reward yourself for accomplishing diet goal objectives (have your nails manicured and painted get a new hair style or purchase a new handbag). - consider joining a dieting support group. you'll hear success stories make new friends and will learn additional tips to making dieting a positive self-improvement venture. best wishes for your success.

Question: do any medicare supplemental plans cover adult daycare for elders with cognitive limits due to dementia?
Baseline Response: No. Adult daycare is only provided to those adults who have a cognitive limitation or who are able to do so. If you have a dementia diagnosis and you are unable to participate in a daycare program, you will not be covered by the supplemental plans.
This is a general question that many health professionals have asked for years, and the answer is simple: no. No supplemental plan is required for daycare.
The following questions have been asked for a number of years:
1) What is the age range of the individual who would be covered under a supplemental plan?
2) What are the benefits of a supplemental Plan?
3) What should I expect from a plan if I am diagnosed with dementia? (see below)
For this question, the answer was simple: Yes, you should expect to be covered for a day care plan.
If

Expected Response: no. medicare generally does not pay for services that people with dementia most commonly need -- help dressing bathing and eating among others. you likely need a long-term care policy to cover such costs and unfortunately once dementia has set in it's too late to purchase one. to find services in your community that can possibly help make contact with the alzheimer's association: www. alz. org.

Question: my son vomited about 10 minutes after taking a second dose of penicillin for strep throat. should he take the next dose?
Baseline Response: My husband vomits 3-4 minutes after drinking a gallon of beer. should we take the third dose? My son's blood work has been very poor. should his blood work be better? Answer. My son is about 3-5 years old and is suffering from severe rheumatic fever. should my son take the fourth dose? my son's breath is very dry and he is sick. should the second injection be given to my son? Answer.: My son has a severe rhea. should i take the fifth dose? Your son's body is very weak. should our son take a second injection? Your child is very sick. Should our son be given

Expected Response: penicillin can be harsh on the stomach. it is important to take it with food and not on an empty stomach. your pharmacist may also be able to flavor the medication to make it easier for your son to take. i would make sure the vomiting has subsided before giving him another dose. since i don’t know the original diagnosis or the reason for his penicillin prescription i wouldn’t know if the condition is causing the vomiting or the medication. let his stomach settle a bit and try giving him something small to eat something that will be light on his stomach. see if he can hold this down before giving him another dose of medication. if the vomiting continues consult your health care provider to discuss an option that may be less upsetting to his stomach.

Question: is it unhealthy to eat meat and dairy at the same time? . im asking about eating both of them at the same time and not about eating each one seperately.
Baseline Response: it's healthy to eat both of these foods at the exact same time.
I know I'm not the only one who has been worried about eating meat and butter at the time of my son's birth.
In fact, I've been worried for years about eating dairy at my son.
Why would I want to eat that stuff when it's the only thing I can eat at the house?
I've been told by many people that the only way to eat dairy is to eat it when it is your last meal.
But that's not true.
When I was a kid, my mom told me that if I ate both of my two favorite foods, I'd be better off eating both.
Now, I'm a little confused about what she meant.
She said

Expected Response: no the human body is capable of tolerating both meat and dairy at the same time.

Question: what is fraxel and how does it compare to a co2 laser peel?
Baseline Response: fraxels are a laser that has a diameter of 3 millimeters, which is very small. It is very hard to see through a co-laser. It has a magnetic field that is a little bit higher than a laser. It can be used as a high-energy laser.
Fraxels have a large laser beam, so it has a very high magnetic field. The laser beam has a small field of strength. It will travel at about the speed of light. It does not have a magnetic pole. It comes at very high speeds.
This is called a coelaser. The coelas will spin, so the coelaut must be spinning at the same speed.
The coelauts are very easy to use. You can use a coxel to see and feel.
It will be a little hard to tell what it is.

Expected Response: fraxel is a non-ablative erbium-glass treatment that has been used to improve acne scars and uneven pigmentation with some success. usually 4-6 treatments are needed. there is usually little down time with redness and scaling for a few days after the treatment. fractional co2 treatments build on the gold-standard co2 resurfacing laser for improvement of lines wrinkles sun damage and other signs of aging. usually only a treatment is needed but it is ablative which means that there is greater recovery time usually about 7-10 days.

(about half way). i also have told by physical therapist that shoulder blades are out of ligne and tingle(burn sensatoin) in both shoulderblades. what could this be?
Baseline Response: it is not clear. i can no longer sit or walk comfortably in my right arm. i feel tingled and the tingle is very intense. i am not sure what to do. it has been a year and

Expected Response: maybe you should get your nerves tested. i had a neck injury that was not visible from my mri and cat scans and was effecting my right arm. i was feeling nerve pain down my right arm and tingling at my fingertips and also had weakness in my arm. when i injured myself my spine pinched my nerve that runs down my arm.
================================================================================
Question: how does hand foot and mouth disease affect pregnancy and the baby?
Baseline Response: The child has a tendency to become a "slender" foot and tongue. This is a condition that occurs in both the mother and baby.
This is due to the fact that the mother is very sensitive to the hand and mouth movements. In addition, the child has the tendency to get a little slippy when she is in the womb.
The baby is born with a very strong tongue and a strong palate. This makes the tongue and palate very strong.
If the mother has a strong tongue, she will often have a strong gag reflex. In this case, she may also have a very weak gag reflex, as she is often unable to see her own mouth.
Although the tongue is strong, the palate is weak. In the case of the baby, the baby's tongue is much stronger than the palate.
Therefore, the tongue can be very strong when the baby is in

Expected Response: commonly hfm is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. information regarding fetal exposure to hfm during pregnancy is limited. no solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects. however should a baby be born to a mother with active hfm symptoms the risk of neonatal infection is high. typically such newborns have a mild illness. rarely overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as liver heart and brain can be lethal.

Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for bacterial vaginosis?
Baseline Response: A doctor should not use an antibiotic to treat bacterial vagitis or a drug to treat the disease.
How can I avoid using antibiotics and antibiotics without causing problems with my patient?
How to avoid antibiotic use:
1. Use a sterile syringe or needle.
2. Avoid injecting a needle into the skin of your patient.
3. Do not inject a needle in the urine of your patients.
4. Do NOT use an intravenous drip, or inject a syringe into your patient's blood stream.
5. Do a regular test to see if your patient is using an antibiotic.
6. Do use an X-ray for anemia.
7. Do have a urine test for bacterial infection.
8. Do take a test for the presence of a virus or bacteria.
9. Do test for a new infection. Do this for

Expected Response: your doctor may only test you for bacterial vaginosis if you: have symptoms. are going to have a hysterectomy or surgical abortion ( bacterial vaginosis increases infection risk afterwards). are pregnant and have had a preterm delivery in the past (a past preterm delivery may have been caused by infection). your doctor can diagnose bacterial vaginosis based on your history of symptoms a vaginal examination and a sample of the vaginal discharge. laboratory tests to detect signs of bacterial vaginosis may include: wet mount. a sample of vaginal discharge is mixed with a salt (normal saline) solution after placing it on a microscope slide. the prepared slide is examined to identify the bacteria present to look for white blood cells that indicate an infection and to look for unusual cells called clue cells. the presence of clue cells is the most reliable indicator of bacterial vaginosis. whiff test. several drops of a potassium hydroxide (koh) solution are added to a sample of vaginal discharge to determine whether a strong fishy odor is produced. a fishy odor on the whiff test suggests bacterial vaginosis. vaginal ph. the normal vaginal ph is 3. 8 to 4. 5. bacterial vaginosis usually causes the vaginal ph to rise above 4. 5. gram stain. a sample of the vaginal discharge is placed on a microscope slide. a special dye is applied to the slide causing certain types of bacteria (gram-positive bacteria) to turn a shade of purple while coloring others (gram-negative bacteria) pink. in bacterial vaginosis gram-negative bacteria especially gardnerella vaginalis are most common. oligonucleotide probes. this test detects the genetic material ( dna ) of bacterial vaginosis bacteria. oligonucleotide probe testing is very accurate but is not routinely available in most labs. the presence of clue cells an increased vaginal ph and a positive whiff test are enough evidence to treat for bacterial vaginosis. bacterial vaginosis may be detected during routine pap testing. but pap testing is not a standard test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: why do nipples get hard during exercise? . i'm not cold when i exercise in the gym but my nipples are always erect. what is the physiological response that's taking place?
Baseline Response: -

Yes, i have the same feeling of a hard nipple. i am cold and i need a cold shower to get some moisture in my body.

. i'm curious to know if your body is very cold during your exercise.

Answer

Expected Response: your nipples most likely become erect during exercise as part of the thermoregulation process of maintaining your body’s internal core temperature or as a result of other stimuli. there doesn’t seem to be a clear agreement for the physiological response that is taking place during exercise specifically but here are a few ideas: • your body heats up during exercise and it produces sweat as a response. your sweat evaporates from your skin removing heat and cooling your body in the process. your nipples can become erect as they are being cooled since coldness is a stimulus for erect nipples. • exercise shirts are designed to be “breathable” by increasing circulation to disperse heat away from your skin. this increased airflow and circulation could compound the cooling effect of evaporation. • your nipples are very sensitive so the continual friction caused by your shirt vigorously moving back and forth as you exercise may be irritating them. • your body may just be at a heightened state of arousal during exercise. this doesn’t mean sexual arousal rather just a physiological state of heighted autonomic arousal that you experience during exercise in the same way that you experience changes to heart rate respiratory rate perspiration etc. erect nipples may just be another natural component of that. try to take notice of when you first experience this happening so that maybe you can better identify what’s triggering it. if it bothers you i would suggest wearing a padded exercise bra if you’re a woman or experiment with different clothing materials for your shirt. try putting your exercise shirt as a base layer and a cotton t-shirt over it to help keep you warm and to cover it up. you can also buy nipple covers or put a band-aid over them to help conceal them.

Question: how do you get tendinitis?
Baseline Response: You may need to start by cleaning your body with a little soap and water, but you'll find that it's actually quite easy to clean up your tendinosis.
What it looks like on your skin:
The most common symptoms of tendinosclerosis are redness and redness on the skin.
The redness is usually caused by the redness of the blood vessels lining the skin, which can lead to blood clots.
Redness is a sign of a problem with the body. The most common type of redness in the body is the red spot on your face. It's caused by a red spot that is often called a red rash.
When you see a redness, it's usually because of the red skin around your eyes.
A red rash is a blood clot that forms in the blood vessel around your eye. It can lead directly to the skin's red spot.
If

Expected Response: tendonitis is usually caused by overuse of a muscle group or joint. repeated sliding of the tendon during heavy use especially when a person is unaccustomed to it can result in irritation causing pain in and around the tendon. “tennis elbow ” or lateral epicondylitis is an example of tendonitis resulting from overuse or strain. other sports activities (e. g. golf) and chores (house painting) can cause tendonitis too. for some people with tendonitis no repetitive activity can be blamed as a cause; wear-and-tear from aging probably plays a role in these cases of tendonitis. using proper swing mechanics in tennis and golf and trying not to overdo it when starting a new activity are the best ways to avoid tendonitis. should i get an xray to determine whether i have a tendinitis or fracture round my knee?

Expected Response: the single most important step to keep your skin youthful is to avoid the sun. use sunscreen with antioxidant vitamins and wear protective clothing and coverings.
================================================================================
Question: what can i do about cesarean section or pregnany scars?
Baseline Response: cesoraphores are the most common scars on the inside of the vagina. They can also be the most painful. If you are pregnant, you will have cesory plexuses. The plexus is the part of the vaginal wall that contains the clitoris, and the plexis is the area that contains both the cervix and the labia minora. You may have a plexal plexoma. It can be found on the right side of the cervice. It may be found in the cerviculus, on the upper left side of your vulva. The cesary plexia is a scar on the outside of the uterus, but it may be located on the inner side of ovaries, on top of the uterine wall, or in the vagina itself.
You may have:
- Pregnancy- It may cause vaginal

Expected Response: scarring results from a either a tear in the dermis (stretch marks) or an overgrowth of collagen with raised scars (keloids ). there is really no way to prevent scars completely. if you are genetically predisposed to scar formation you probably will have a scar. once a keloid scar develops intervene early (before the scar is raised and thickened) and massage your scar frequently with a vitamin e based moisturizer; this helps break down additional collagen build-up. during pregnancy remain well-hydrated in order to keep the dermis healthy and less susceptible to tearing also moisturize with a vitamin e based moisturizer.

Question: can a urine test detect chlamydia if a tampon was worn while urinating? . does wearing a tampon or having your cycle affect the accuracy of the test?
Baseline Response: no. The tests used to test for chlamydialysis are not reliable. The test is not used to detect chlodex, gonorrhea, or syphilis.

Expected Response: a tampon will not affect the accuracy of a urine test. these are two different "compartments". a urine chlamydia test or any other urine test would still be accurate whether you had a tampon in or not.
================================================================================
Question: i have pierced ears and the holes are getting stretched out. can dermal fillers fix my ears so they are like new again? . does this hurt and who can do this? do i need to see a dermatologist or an ent doc?
Baseline Response: i am not sure what to do next.
Answer #2: i need some type of medicine to prevent the ear infection. i am a diabetic and i have a lot of water and a lot to drink and it will make my ear infections go away. i want to go to an ENT doctor.
Solution: i would recommend going to an ER doctor. they will do a lot more to treat the infection.

Expected Response: dermatologist plastic surgeons and certain ent doctors who are aesthetically trained can inject dermal fillers into the earlobes to create more volume which will make the hole smaller; and this is a temporary fix for this problem. over time if that earlobe continues to stretch if that hole continues to stretch and pull the earlobe down with earrings then it can actually be removed and sown back together and then you can make a new hole to solve that problem on a permanent basis. however it also might help if you wear an earring that has a larger back that gives more support and try not to wear earrings that are too heavy that are going to pull down or if you do wear those once in a while try not to wear them for longer than you absolutely have to.

Question: is a blood pressure of 153/94 dangerous when i have always had a very normal blood pressure before? . i have had normal blood pressure for years but now i have excessively rapid resting pulse and bp in the 150/95 area. i have had a nuclear stress test that showed normal parameters.
Baseline Response: 

Expected Response: i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!

Question: what kind of doctor should i see for high blood pressure? . i need a physical and recently i've checked my blood pressure and it has been high. i want to know what kind of doctor should i see?

Expected Response: the best plan is for you to see the primary care doctor. that person can complete your physical assess your blood pressure concerns possibly start treatment if necessary and refer you to other medical specialists as needed. while waiting to see your primary care doctor i would continue to periodically take ramdom b/p readings. start a journel to record those readings along with the date and time taken whose machine was used (your own or a local pharmacy etc. ) arm used for testing standing or sitting position and all recent activities that you were engaged in (eating exercise etc. ) prior to the testing. show the journal entries to your doctor during the office visit. if you used your own machine to obtain the readings it is advisable to also bring it to your medical appointment for confirm of its accuracy.

Question: i had my genital warts removed by surgical excision 3 days ago how do i know if they're infected. . i have been cleaning with soap and water 2-3 times a day and apply bacitracin as well. i did not get stitches he used silver nitrate to stop the bleeding. in these places it looks as if they're oozing with puss but it seems more gooey and doesn't come off.
Baseline Response: my only hope is that you have the right to have your genital wart removed. If you have it removed by an optometrist or doctor it is highly recommended you take it out to your doctor for an appointment. If it is a small wart it is probably too small to be removed by the doctor. You can always go to your local optometrists office and have your doctor check it.

Expected Response: it sounds like you're doing a good job caring for your post-surgical wounds. be sure to keep following all the post-surgical instructions you were given. the risk of infection for your procedure is relatively low. the classic signs of infection are: fever loss of appetite feeling like you're coming down with the flu severe pain/swelling/bleeding in the surgical area. if the "gooey pus" you're seeing is yellowish in color chances are good this is not an infection. as the skin heals itself it tends to over-produce protein cells. these cells look kind of yellow gooey and sticky. if that's what you're seeing it's probably a normal part of the healing process. don't scrub these cells off. just gently wash with warm soapy water and rinse well. if your surgeon told you to use antibiotic ointment like bacitracin then continue to do so according to the post-surgical instructions you were given. as your wounds heal you also can apply a vitamin a & vitamin d ointment (often used for diaper rash) to help your skin heal. if you develop a fever or any other signs of a true infection contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Question: my daughter has cavities in her bottom molars. she needs a root canal and a silver cap. why is this done for baby teeth?
Baseline Response: she is born with a root cavity. She also needs a silver molar and a root cap.
Answer #2: I have a small molar in my left eye. I have an irregular tooth. My doctor is trying to make sure that my child does not have cavities. I am not sure if the cavities are caused by the cavitation, or if the child has a very small molars in the left eye and a very large molar on the right.
My daughter has a small cavities, but her right eye is not very well protected.
This is not a problem for me, because I have had a minor cavities for many years. I need a root and a stem to help protect my right eye.
The root and stem are very easy to use, but they are not

Expected Response: the simple answer is probably yes. the premature loss of a baby tooth can damage other teeth alter the eruption patterns of the other teeth and dramatically change any orthodontic intervention. so see the dentist and follow their recommendations.

Question: i had a tubal ligation in aug. of this year and now i'm aroused all the time. why is that?
Baseline Response: It's because i'm so horny and horny that i can't even stand up without a pillow.
Answer 5: When i was growing up, i was told by my dad that my mum was a bit of a slut. she said that i was so shy that i couldn't take a boy in my bedroom.
So, i got really horny and wanted to take a girl in my bed.
After a few months, i finally decided to get in touch with my mom.
She took me to a local pub and asked me if I was going to take her in my room.
I said yes, and she told me that i wanted to go in there.
And then i was in my bathtub with her and she came up and said that she would like to see me with a boy.
The next day

Expected Response: well that's an interesting question! i suggest you consult your gynecologist to make sure everything's doing fine medically speaking. some women find they feel more frisky after tubal ligation or hysterectomy because they know they can't become pregnant. for some women this knowledge makes them feel more relaxed and playful about sex. perhaps this is the case for you. i can't think of any medical reason why a tubal ligation would make you feel aroused all the time but if it's a problem then i certainly suggest you consult a medical professional. if it's not a problem i'd suggest going with the flow and enjoying yourself. take care!

Expected Response: i suggest going to your doctor and describing exactly what you are going through. also if this is not the first time this has happened you need to mention that as well. when you are severely agitated do you feel like you are outside yourself looking in and wanting to stop yourself from doing or saying whatever is going on but it's like you have no control over what you are doing? make a list of all the things that you do or feel so you don't forget like if you have tons of energy out of the blue or go on major shopping sprees or if you feel like no one cares about you or your feelings. search deep within yourself even the things that you hate to think about much less talk about and write it all down and go to your doctor. he may have some options for you. i am no doctor but by what you described is what i used to feel like and then some. i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. i used to get panic attacks all the time but they went away. i'm not diagnosing you but suggesting that you see a doctor. you may just be going through something that happens when the seasons change ironically called seasonal affective disorder (sad. )

Question: why can't you give children baby aspirin?
Baseline Response: because it's not a good idea.
The FDA says that when a child has taken an aspirin, they should not take it without first knowing what is in it.
But they are not talking about aspirin. The FDA says you have to know what is inside the aspirin, and what is not.
What is in an aspirin? A lot.
An aspirin is a lot more than just a single pill. It is the most important ingredient in every medicine. It contains the key ingredients that are essential for a healthy body.
You can see in the picture above that we are talking about the aspirin.
It contains the calcium, the vitamin C, the magnesium, the vitamins A and C.
And the reason why it is called an aspirin is because it is the one that is most important for a normal body to function.
So, it is important for the body to do the right thing, but it

Expected Response: basically there is no need for children to get aspirin now that acetaminophen and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter and approved for children. these are safer alternatives and it is best to just avoid giving aspirin to children entirely. aspirin has been linked to causing a rare but severe reaction called reye's syndrome in children who have certain viral illnesses. reye's syndrome can be fatal and causes damage to the liver and the brain.

Question: what are the health risks of ulcerative colitis?
Baseline Response: ulceration of the colon (e.g. colonic ulcer, colonic adenocarcinoma, colonitis, etc.).
The most common causes of ulcers are the following:
Unhealthy growth, weight gain, weight loss, and weight gain in the past year or so
Sudden weight loss after a period of illness
Low-grade inflammation or inflammation in the rectum or rectum area
Increased risk of disease
Decreased quality of life, and low-grade illness
Somewhat more than one-third of people who have ulcer disease have a history of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease.
Uniformity in the disease is due to a combination of several factors.
-The patient is more likely to be older and more likely than others to be overweight
-Excessive body weight
-Sugar, or other substances

Expected Response: because ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine it can cause severe and sometimes bloody diarrhea putting patients at risk for iron deficiency and anemia. ulcerative colitis can also deplete stores of folate. that's especially dangerous for women of child-bearing age since folate deficiency is linked to birth defects. fluid loss from diarrhea can also cause electrolyte imbalances. severe infections can occur in the large intestine but they are uncommon. ulcerative colitis is also associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. for that reason doctors recommend frequent colonoscopy examinations. your doctor may discuss other risks with you.

Answer to your question: I have been pregnant for

Expected Response: this early a pregnant woman may not have sufficient hcg to be detected on those tests so repeat them the blood test in a few weeks. so yes you can be pregnant. if you are having sex not using birth control and you and your partner is not sterile it is only a matter of time before a pregnancy will happen. yes! i had negative blood and urine test but i felt pregnant this was my third pregnancy so i knew a thing or two. i did not have a missed period but i just knew. when friday came i was three days my period i said ok if this is negative then im not and my mind is playing tricks on me. everything was negative both blood and urine. fine went out bought a box of pads my period would be here monday and i was over it. monday came and no period bought a pregnancy test just to make sure and there were those double lines. called my dr. she ordered blood work my hcg levels were crazy high and she had no words. so a woman knows hopfully this helped. no you can not be pregnant. blood test are very accurate and if it came out negative then you are not pregnant.

Question: how much should i weigh?
Baseline Response: 3-5kg
1-5-6kg
2-5 kg
3-5.5 kg (5-7kg)
1 kg for people who are overweight
3 kg for those with diabetes
4-5% for those who are obese
6-10% for people with type 2 diabetes
11-15% for persons with type 1 diabetes
16-20% for obese persons with diabetes and those with type 3 diabetes
21-25% for anyone with diabetes.
16% for any type of diabetes.

Expected Response: doctors nutritionists and public health authorities most often use the body mass index to define a healthy weight. body mass index (bmi) is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2). according to the cdc a bmi of less than 18. 5 is considered underweight. a normal bmi falls within the range of 18. 5 to 24. 9. the bmi range of 25. 0 to 29. 9 is considered overweight and a bmi of 30. 0 or higher is considered obese. . obesity increases the risk for diabetes high blood pressure heart attack stroke certain cancers. losing weight reduces your risk. waist size matters too. even in people who are only slightly overweight a waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women increases health risks. don’t believe your pant size; it often underestimates waist circumference. measure your waist yourself with a tape measure just below the belly button.

Baseline Response: The above question is about the corporation and is of no significance to us. We do not have a separate sub corporation. We are the only stockholders. We have a stock of 1120 Form 941 in our name. If we were to take the same risk, we would have to take that risk.

Question: what are the post-op instructions after an embryo transfer?
Baseline Response: the post office is the first place that you will receive the post of embryo transfer.
The post office will do a brief interview, which is usually in person, and will ask you to explain what you're looking for.
You'll then be asked about the specific procedures you'd like to perform, and how you would like to be treated.
After that, you'll be given a list of all the procedures you would want to perform and what you'd want to do.
Once the interview is over, you can sign up for a free 3-day consultation with a specialist.
How to start the postop process
The first step is to make sure you're in good health, and that you're doing everything you can to make the best possible impression of your new child.
As a result, your postop services will be available to you in your home or office for a period of

Expected Response: there is no clear evidence that activitiy restrictions after an embryo transfer increase pregnancy rates. . most of the reproductive endocrinologists that i work with do advise light activity for a few up to 14 hours but not strict bed rest. personally i do advise patients to avoid sexual intercourse for up to a week because the prostaglandins in semen can cause strong uterine contractions. again i believe that this is empiric as i don't know of good evidence that demonstrates that intercourse lower the chances of conception. unfortunately we don't have evidence to support everything that we do. .

Question: is eating chicken bone bad for our health?
Baseline Response: chicken bone is a common problem in the United States, especially for people with pre-existing conditions. People with chicken bone often have very little or no health benefits, including weight loss, low blood pressure, and reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.
People with pre and post-existing health problems often have a range of health benefits from eating chicken bones, including:
• low cholesterol and blood pressure
• a lower risk of diabetes
• improved blood circulation and better overall health
• better bone health and well-being
• increased bone density and strength
• more healthy bones
• fewer cavities and more bone loss
• less chronic disease
• lower blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol
• reduced risk for heart disease, stroke, and other heart problems
• greater bone density, better bone texture, and increased bone mineral density
• higher blood pressure (and blood cholesterol)
• faster and more stable

Expected Response: i once assisted an extensive abdominal surgery on a person who was eating chicken (including the bones) and one of those shards perforated his bowel. i often seen people in my practice who have pieces of bone (fish or chicken) caught in their throats. i never give chicken bones to any of my pets since i don't want to risk the same problems so when you eat a chicken bone(s) you take a chance.

Question: is surgery an option for ulcerative colitis?
Baseline Response: Yes. The problem is that we don't know how to treat ulceration. We can't predict what kind of treatment will help. We need to make sure that we're getting the treatment we need.
If you're at all concerned about your health, you may want to look at some of the things you can do to prevent ulcerations.
1. Go to your doctor.
2. Ask your doctor about the treatment options available.
3. Talk with your doctor and his or her office about any treatment options you'd like to see.
4. If you feel like your doctor may be right, talk to your insurance company.
5. Find out if your doctor is willing to discuss treatment options with you.
6. Take some time to think about what to do if you feel you have a condition that prevents you from getting the right treatment.
7. Ask a doctor

Expected Response: the only true cure for ulcerative colitis is the removal of the colon a procedure called a colectomy. however this means that a permanent external bag to drain the stool is needed. surgery is considered a last resort performed when the disease does not respond to medication. surgery is also indicated when there are precancerous or cancerous lesions of the colon.

Question: my 3 year old son has ringworm and it’s spreading. what do i put on it? how long does it take to go away?
Baseline Response: the ringworm can stay in your glove for about 2 weeks.
Solution: if your glove is too tight, you can use a cloth to wrap it around your hand.
Answer 1: your glove may not be comfortable to wear with your gloves. your glove can be adjusted to fit your body.

Expected Response: i would be sure to see his pediatrician and/or pediatric dermatologist. they will most likely do a culture to identify if it is truly ringworm (which is a fungal infection of the skin that appears in worm-like round patches) or if it might be simple eczema or dry skin. using hydrocortisone on a fungal infection without properly addressing the infection could cause the rash to worsen. depending on how much of the body is affected the physician might recommend topical and or oral antifungal medications to get the rash under control.

Question: are estrogen pills good for breast enhancement? . men take estrogen to grow breasts when they want to become transsexual. i am 30 and have never had firm breasts or large breasts. is estrogen a good method to restart breast growth naturally for me? i would like to grow to be a full c cup if not a small d cup.
Baseline Response: yes, but i am not a full size c cup. The c cup is a natural way to begin the process of growing breasts. i feel like i am able to do it as a full sized c cup and then i can do my own breast enhancement.
I'm 18 and my first breast enhancement is a c cup for me. I've had some good results with my c cup, but most of them were from my own breasts. I'm just starting to gain weight. I'd be interested in getting some other options if you have a c cu and/or size that is good for me!
Answer 2: I am not

Expected Response: estrogen is not an acceptable nor "natural" pharmacological method of enhancing the size of your (female) breasts otherwise women on birth control pills or women who are taking estrogen after menapause would have enlarging breasts. what nature has not provided clothing or bra choices can help compensate or you will need to see a plastic/cosmetic surgeon. estrogen is not the way to go.

Question: my dr told me i was in diabetic range he perscribed me some medicaion and i refuse to take it. . i want to know what are the risks of not taking medicine when i am looseing weight and on a regular exercise plan.
Baseline Response: I was diagnosed with my diabetes in the mid 2000s and I have been taking medicaison for over 2 years. My doctor told me that I could not take it because of the diabetes. The doctor was not aware of any risks associated with taking medicine. I also have a few other conditions, such as a heart attack or stroke, but none of them are risk factors for my diabetes. I have tried medicaisons, but have not found any benefit. I am willing to take the medicaib to treat my condition but I would be reluctant to take medicait because it is not effective for me.
I have been using medicaite for about 2 years now. My problem is that my

Question: what are some low-impact weight-bearing exercises for osteoporosis?
Baseline Response: You can use a lot of different exercises for low-to-moderate-impact osteopors. Some exercises will help you lower your body weight. These are:
-Lifting weights in the chest
-Standing with hands on hips
-Rushing with hands off hips
/rushing with feet on hips.
-Sprinting on your back, back, arms, and legs with hands in front of you.
There are many exercises that will help reduce the amount of weight on your body. You can do any number of these exercises. One of the most common exercises is walking.
The other is the squat.
One of the best exercises is the pull-up.
It's a very good exercise to do when you're not doing any specific exercises.
Do any of these lifts in the gym?
These are some of the low-intensity weight

Expected Response: if your doctor determines that it's not safe for you to perform high-impact weight-bearing exercises he or she may recommend low-impact weight-bearing exercises that are less likely to cause fractures and also build and maintain bone density. these include: elliptical training machines low-impact aerobics stair-step machines walking (either outside or on a treadmill machine). if you're new to exercise or haven't exercised for awhile you should aim to gradually increase your level of weight-bearing exercise to 30 minutes per day on most days of the week. although exercise can benefit almost everyone with osteoporosis it's important to remember that it's only one component of an overall treatment program. other essential lifestyle recommendations include a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption. you also may require osteoporosis medications to either build or maintain bone density. by working with your doctor you can develop an osteoporosis treatment program that's right for you.

Question: lately i have had pain towards the end of my urination & after i am finished. i also have to urinate more. possible uti?
Baseline Response: i have to be very careful to not pee. i have not seen anyone else pee in my urinals. i am not sure if it is because of urination, or if i am peeing in the toilet. i would like to know if it could be the same problem in your toilet?

Question: i heard that on my mother’s side of the family there are people who get their adult teeth twice. can this be true?
Baseline Response: i have heard that when i am in the car, my mom always takes me to the dentist and then I have to clean my teeth. I have heard about people getting their teeth removed twice because their mother always tells them to "clean your teeth". So, my mother always goes to the dental clinic and she says "it's your right to do that, but you have to have a good toothbrush and a good car". So I have been told that she will get my teeth removed, and that is what she does.
(This is not true. My mother did get her teeth removed on her own, but my dad did.)

Expected Response: your aunt is pulling your leg! [this is not true. ]
================================================================================
Question: i have medical issues and my husband is healthy. . would it be more advantageous for us to have individual health insurance plans and deductibles?
Baseline Response: Yes, i would.

Expected Response: you and your husband can purchase separate policies if you prefer. your eligibility for a tax subsidy to help you purchase your policy if you qualify would be based on your household income. so if you are purchasing two policies you would each be able to use half of the credit. whether you should purchase an individual or a family policy based on you and your husband's health circumstances will depend on the policies available to you. you should look at whether the deductible applies to each of you individually or whether there is a family deductible. in the case of the family deductible your husband's health expenses may satisfy the deductible for both of you and it could be advantageous to purchase a family policy vs. two individual policies.

Question: if your doctor refuses to test you for something you think you have should you switch doctors? . i've been reading about my symptoms on the internet and i'm pretty sure i may have adult sids but my doctor refuses to run tests for it. how can i make him run the tests without making him mad? i want to do it tactfully. i feel like he's not listening. he just looks at me like i'm crazy when i express my concerns. should i switch doctors?
Baseline Response: I have a very serious issue. I have a heart condition and my doctor told me I needed to be tested for heart problems. When I was admitted to the hospital I was told I was not healthy. I was taken to the operating room and I was given a card with a picture of my heart. I started to feel very sick and the doctor told my doctor that my heart was just too small to see. I took my card and went to my doctor to get a

Expected Response: you should always have the final say with what goes on with your health and your body. if you believe you have a health condition you did a good thing to express your concerns with your doctor. unfortunately your doctor doesn’t seem to be legitimizing or validating your concerns. your doctor may have good reason however to not support your claims. think back to the explanation that your doctor provided for you – is there any possibility that he or she could be right? research online is great but medical advice from a doctor is of course very credible as well. your doctor may have limited exposure to the condition though so maybe you could find a specialist in the area. it’s important to consider the source of your information. another point to consider is that maybe you didn’t express yourself well enough. print out some of the research that you’ve found and try talking to your doctor about what could be causing some of the specific symptoms. in general it’s also important to consider the test itself too. how accurate and reliable is it? is it invasive or are there risks to having it done? what are the pros and cons of doing the testing? there’s no harm in getting a second opinion. just as different people may have different political views; doctors may have differing medical views as well. maybe you can find a different doctor that will better support your views or help you to understand why testing may not be in your best interest. you always have the right to change doctors especially if you have one who will not listen to your concerns. maybe he is not familiar with this condition called sads. <link>

Question: what is emend for injection?
Baseline Response: emend is a way to create a list of emend commands in a file.
The emend command is used to generate a list. The list is then read from the command and added to the emend list.
If you are using emend to create files, you can create a file that is called a .emend file with the .eme file name. If you are not using emenv, you must use the .env file name in your emend file. This will be your default file name for your emenv.
In this example, we have created a file called .emex .
emend -v .emx .emf
This will add .ememx to the list of commands in your .emen file. The command will be added to your .en file by default.
You can create emend files using the command emend -u .

Baseline Response: - "I have been to a lot of different places and they are all so good. i think that people who are not used to their deodorances would never know that they are good for them. i do not feel that they should be used on a regular basis. I think that if people could not get used to deodorans, it would be a huge problem for them

Baseline Response: it is possible to use ammonia and the flu. If you use ammonia it is a good idea to do so.
In fact the way ammonia is absorbed by the body is what makes it good for the body. The body absorbs the ammonia from the body, it is then converted to the bacteria. The bacteria then enter the body and there is a high concentration of ammonia in the body for the bacteria to get in. So it is the bacteria that are the most active in the digestive system.
So the process of ammonia digestion is what is going on in the stomach.
The digestive system is the one that is responsible for the digestion of ammonia and its energy.
If you look at the digestive tract you will see that the digestive process is quite different from that of the brain.
But the digestive processes are very different.
They are very similar in that they are both a part of the body that is

Expected Response: pneumonia and flu? yes you can have both at the same time.

Question: what are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?
Baseline Response: the patient has a fever, and the doctor has been told that the patient is sick. The doctor has indicated that the fever may be related to a problem with the immune system or to the presence of a substance that is not a natural part of the body.
This may include the following:
Fever: the fever is caused by a fungus that has been present in the blood for a long time, and may have been present when the patient was infected with the fungus
(fungi) that has a tendency to cause an infection with the body
(fluid) that is causing a loss of fluid in the body, such as a fluid in a urine that is used for drinking or as a lubricant
(water) that can be used to control the body's immune system
(spore) that may cause an immune system reaction, such that the body is unable to protect itself from an

Expected Response: common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding and diarrhea but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. generally patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. the different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation: ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. in many patients with ulcerative proctitis mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may in addition experience rectal pain urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling) and tenesmus (ineffective painful urge to move one's bowels). proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). symptoms of proctosigmoiditis like that of proctitis include rectal bleeding urgency and tenesmus. some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and the descending colon). symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal cramps weight loss and left-sided abdominal pain. pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon left colon transverse colon and the rectum). symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal pain and cramps weight loss fatigue fever and night sweats. some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. generally however patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration severe abdominal pain protracted diarrhea with bleeding and even shock. they are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colon rupture (perforation). patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. unless they respond to treatment promptly surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colon rupture. while the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. therefore when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his disease the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. nevertheless a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. thus patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis.

Question: how should i take requip for parkinson's disease?
Baseline Response: I would ask the parkinson disease team if they are able to answer this question.
Parkinson's Disease is a disease of the respiratory system, which is the part of the body that contains the lungs, and it is one of the main causes of death. The respiratory system is the body's primary organ and is responsible for protecting the heart from harm. As the disease progresses, the air and water in the lungs become congested. When this happens, the lungs and heart become congester and cause a condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).
In order to prevent CHF, the body must provide oxygen to the airway and supply oxygen to each vital organ. This oxygen is then used to help maintain the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.
In addition to the oxygen, the heart also receives an enzyme called vitamin D, which helps the heart process calcium. This vitamin D

Expected Response: be sure to take your requip exactly as directed by your doctor or healthcare provider. three times a day is the usual way to take requip for parkinson's disease. your doctor will start you on a low dose of requip. your doctor will change the dose until you are taking the right amount of medicine to control your symptoms. it may take several weeks before you reach a dose that controls your symptoms. if you miss a dose do not double your next dose. contact your doctor if you stop taking requip for any reason. do not restart without consulting your doctor. your doctor may prescribe requip alone or add requip to medicine that you are already taking for parkinson's disease. you can take requip with or without food. taking requip with food may decrease the chances of feeling nauseated.

Question: how can i help my 50 yr old fiancee' through issues in her menstrual cycle? . prior to menstruation she not only is irritable but easily angered and flies into rages she becomes despondent and paranoid starts to drink heavily often becoming drunk. when her flow arrives it is extremely heavy clots and heavy pad soaking in 2 hours or less. she becomes weak and tired. she has been prescribed 20 mg evanapril once daily for during menstruation but does not take it. she is a little overweight but active and in good health non smoker. what should i do to assist her?
Baseline Response: i have a wife and 2 children and i am not in a hurry to do anything for her.
Answer 1: i am a young woman and i have been using citalopram for 2 years now. i am trying to get a good dose of citalo but i am still not satisfied with the results. i have tried citalup for 2

Expected Response: good for you for trying to help your partner! i can only imagine how this takes a toll on you. i agree that she should see her doctor again and get a few blood tests done. if she is losing that much blood she may be anemic causing her to feel weak and tired. try to get her to a gyno and go with her if possible. i personally would be most worried about the drinking and paranoia. alcohol is a depressant and is more than likely making things worse though she may feel a bit better at the time she is drinking. there could also be some underlying depression. until she gets to the doctor do your best to be patient and kind. she is clearly not herself at this time and probably feels bad about how she treats you afterwords. try distracting her and getting her to do a bit of excersice (a walk around the park) as it can help some period symptoms. worse comes to worse offer chocolate!

Question: i dont have insurance what is the ball park figure for having a planters wart removed by chemicals or laser therapy?
Baseline Response: i can see that it is very likely that the wart was removed.


Answer :


"I can see it's likely that it was removed due to chemicals or lasers"

Answer , no, i dont see the chemical or laser treatments.

 (Answer : )


If you are a patient and want to see the wart removed, i would suggest looking at the picture of the wart. The wart is about 1.5mm long. If the wart is not visible, i suggest that you look at the wart at the base of the hair.

.

If the wart has the hair on the back, then you can see the tip of the nail.

,


The wart is very small. The diameter of the tip is about 6mm.

:

The tip of a nail is about 3mm

Expected Response: there are no good ballpark figures so my suggestion for you is to call several podiatrists in your area and get the price. many will offer cash discounts to patients without insurance. it would be unusual to get out of any doctor's appointment anymore for $100 to $150 but of course procedures may cost a bit more.

Question: does treatment reverse osteoporosis damage or just stall it?
Baseline Response: it's very difficult to tell, because it depends on your genetics and your health. You could be in the middle of a bone marrow transplant, or you could be living with a normal bone marrow donor. It is possible to do a bone transplant and you can see the progression of the disease, but it is very difficult. If you have a bone that is normal, you can continue to live with it. If your bone is in a condition that is not normal, it may not be able to go back to normal.
If you have any questions about the condition or what your treatment may be for it, you may want to ask your doctor.
What is the best way to get your bone back?
A bone marrow patient can receive a bone broth, a bone-in-one, or a bone bone-out.
The best way is to get a bone out first, then do

Expected Response: most treatments for osteoporosis -- like bisphosphonates and serms -- work by slowing down the process of bone loss. since your body is always naturally remodeling bone slowing down the rate of bone loss may allow it to make new bone faster than you lose it. however forteo is the first treatment that directly spurs the growth of bone. it's usually given as an injection once a day in the thigh or abdomen. prolia works to stop bone loss by directing inhibiting cells that remove bone before they cause bone loss.

Question: what are some exercises that i can do while traveling without carrying any equipment?
Baseline Response: I can walk up and down stairs without carrying a backpack. I can use my backpack to go up stairs and down. I also can walk through the city without carrying anything.

Expected Response: you can do lunges and stair climbing for your legs. no external resistance just your own body weight. if you have someone to hold you by the legs you can do back extensions by lying on your belly with your torso off the bed and lift your back up. you can also just do this lying on the floor then you won't need anyone to hold you. for lats you can lie down on the floor bring your arms up in front of you elbows on the floor and press down trying to lift your torso off the floor. that will work lats. you can also do chair dips they will work your lats a little. it can be more difficult to exercise while traveling but it’s certainly still attainable. here are some ideas and suggestions for ways that you can get exercise while traveling: • there are plenty of different body weight exercises calisthenics or stretches that you can do in your hotel room. here’s a great list of exercises that don’t require equipment: <link> • many hotels have onsite fitness rooms or swimming pools that you may have access to • try to find nearby parks or ways to get involved in recreational activities outdoors • go for a walk or run outside or do stair climbing • resistance bands require little space so they can be packed easily and be used in a hotel room • if you’re bringing a laptop you can bring an exercise dvd to use in your hotel room. if you don’t own an exercise video you can search for free ones to watch online be unconventional and think outside of the box if necessary. if it’s still a challenge for you to do exercise while traveling make it a point to be more diligent by doing exercise on days where you have more control of your environment or try to plan your exercise around travel as best as possible.

Question: can you mix naproxen 500mg with antihistamine
Baseline Response: I use naproxene and naproxilene for the first few days after I take it. I have seen other people with acne, and I know they have some problems with it. The only thing I have noticed is the increase in the amount of the side effects. It's hard to tell with the results. It seems like the only way to get rid of it is to take it without taking it for the rest of the day. I don't like the side effect of naproxenes because it's a lot more expensive. I think it's because I'm using naproxes that I don. I feel like I'm not getting the benefit of the naproxine.

Expected Response: two different drugs. they can be used at the same time.

Answer #2: Is this a pregnancy test or a blood test?
The most common question in pregnancy testing is: "Is this pregnancy test? If so, how do I get the test?"
Answer#1: The test is called a Pap smear. If you get it the first time and you have a positive result, it is called an Pap smear or Pap smear + Pap smear test.
There are many different types of tests available that can be used to test for pregnancy. Most commonly, you get an Pap test that says:
A positive test shows that the child has a testicle. This means that

Question: i have an abscess tooth been treating w/anitbiotics. cant be pulled for another year due to insurance. will it be ok? . the tooth has been abscess for about 6 months now. i have another year to wait until my insurance will pay for the partial i need. i'm a woman and it's a front tooth and i don't want to go toothless for over a year. i don't want to hurt myself either so i need to know if i keep treating with antibiotics when it abscesses will i be ok until i can get my partial?
Baseline Response: it is possible that the abscess is not healing properly and it is very painful. If this is the case, the pain can be very intense. If the pain is not so intense, the absolutes are not in place and the problem is not being treated with antibiotics. It is possible the absolve is only the end of the problem.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: that is a question that only your dentist can answer. waiting a year being toothless is not something that anyone would want to do. i really have no idea if you can wait a year. some medical and dental problems precede our insurance. you couldn't wait a year with appendicitis so you may not be able to wait a year before you have the proper insurance.

Question: how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: it's quite simple.
So, as mentioned, there are several ways that you can manage your dizziness during pregnancy.
First, you can start taking medication for the condition by drinking water (or even by using your own body's own natural medicine) to help you manage the condition.
Second, you may be able to use herbal medicine (or the like) to relieve your dizzyness.
Third, you might have other symptoms of pregnancy (such as headache or pain).
Fourth, you have a history of breast cancer, which is usually not something you want to deal with in pregnancy. So, you could try using a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy (or try to get pregnant before you know).
Fifth, you're probably getting an allergic reaction to some foods or other foods (such like nuts, seeds, and fruit).
Sixth, your fetus may have a lot

Expected Response: dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.

Question: are there any types of blood pressure devices that are inserted inside of you invented? . any types of blood pressure checking devices that are inserted inside of you to check blood pressure? and by inserted inside i mean inserted permanetly inside of you. . thanks <positive_smiley>
Baseline Response: there are several types of devices that can be inserted inside your body and the more commonly used ones are the blood pressure device (blood pressure reading device, blood pressure reading syringe or syringe, blood test device, or blood pressure sensor).
<positive_sugar>
<negative_smoke>
The syringe and blood pressure reader are inserted into the blood vessels of the penis and can be used to check the blood flow.
< positive_smoker>
These are usually inserted inside the penis or the penis itself.
The positive smoke device can be connected to the blood vessel to check for any blood pressure changes and can also be inserted into a vein to check

Expected Response: to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it.

Expected Response: at consultation the evaluation includes a lot of factors some patients aren’t aware of. it’s not just the shape or size of your nose. it’s the quality the material there that is available to work with. for example thick oily skin tends not to drape down even though you shave down the bump and narrow the tip because what you are doing is narrowing the under the surface structures the bone and the cartilage. but the upholstery meaning the skin it does best when it’s thin and will shrink down uniformly and give a nice contour. so thick skin is a bit of a challenge for us. and oily skin has a greater tendency to have breakouts and all those things that kind of be a bit of a hassle for the patient. and the other question is even the strength of the cartilage because strong cartilages are really ideal because you can work with them easier. people that have very soft cartilage there’s a very narrow window in which you can work because if you’re a little over zealous and take out too much that cartilage is so weak that often the nose will kind of start to collapse and dip down. you’ve got to factor all these things into your decision making but that decision making is done really at the time of consultation. that’s where our most intense thoughts are being hatched because we have the patient in front of us we have the ability to feel to look size up the situation. we need to look inside the nose and see if there’s blockage because often if you make the nose a little narrower and the airway isn’t so super to begin with the patient may note afterwards that gee my breathing isn’t quite as good as it was before what’s going on here? so that patient may need to have the discussion about gee i think we need to open up your air passages a little bit while we’re there because after all the nose is still a functional organ regardless of how good it looks if it doesn’t work the patient is not going to be happy.

Question: my daughter is having pvcs and palpatations. . she is an 18 year old female in college who is 5 ' 1 and weighs 97 pounds. what can cause this sudden onset? she had a stress test yesterday and her resting heart rate was 111 and higher.
Baseline Response: the stress test was negative.
The stress test is a measure of a person's ability to endure a stressful situation. It is important to note that stress test results are not a good indicator of a child's ability.
A child's stress test scores are not indicative of a healthy child's mental health. The best way to measure a child is to measure his or her cognitive performance, including verbal fluency. A child's test scores can be extremely accurate.

Expected Response: many things. too much caffeine drugs/medications. or even the emotional stress of college. right now the medical provider is trying to rule out any cardiac (heart) causes for those symptoms but many times there are other factors in play. since i do not know your daughter or her medical history it would not be possible for me to be specific on the many possibilities.

Question: i have bruises and swelling on foot and ankle due to an accident can i exercise?
Baseline Response: i was in a bike accident and i was riding on a public road when i hit my bike. my head was just spinning in the air. I was hurt and my head started to spin and my hands were flying. I went to the doctor and he told me that the swelling was from the head injury. i am so sorry.

Expected Response: no way! it is not worth the risk of giving yourself a bigger pain with that ankle. what i now know is that when an ankle bruised. all those muscles that were able to help you not get hurt before are strained and stretched and if it heals proberly then you might be able to continue same lifestyle. after it has mended. if you make one simple bad move that might not seem difficult. it could. that is when you potentially always have a bad ankle. really just sit this one out.

Expected Response: there is a lot of hype around "detoxing" and "cleansing" these days. most of what you'll hear is untrue and can be just a waste of your time and money. there’s no evidence that detoxing and cleansing has any health benefit. nonetheless there are lifestyle changes you can make to “detox” your body. cutting back on saturated fats daily calories refined grains sugar and sodium can help you reap all kinds of health benefits. instead choose fruits and vegetables whole grains fat-free or low-fat dairy lean protein seafood and healthy fats. detoxification or “detox” is a buzzword that has no medical rational or scientific basis for its claims. the simple fact is that your body already has the full capabilities to remove toxins and if anything you may actually be harming your body through commonly promoted detox pills and diets. if you feel as though you might need a detox try making lifestyle changes through eliminating processed foods eating more whole foods like fruits and vegetables and beginning an exercise routine. check out the following articles for more information regarding detoxification: <link> and <link>. here are some things to do to help you cleanse your body naturally. drink water. exercise and do aerobics. take a fiber supplement. add body cleansing foods to your diet drink green tea use colon cleansers supplement today's many product in market but look on the colopril reviews to get the solution of your problem. 1. by drinking plain water about 2 litres everyday. 2. eat more fibres to induce excretion from our body. 3. eat less frozen or ready made food (fast food) cause it contains preservatives that slow the cleaning or detoxification process. they may also promote more toxic inside our body) 4. drink green tea with much plain water. (must increase your water intake at least for 2 litres or the green tea may harm your body since the medium which is water is insufficient) 5. exercise. 6. smoking and drinking alcohol less. ( they only promote more toxic inside our body. ) 7. practice a healthy life-style. 8. take care your kidney (detoxification process happen there). detoxification does happen and can be done naturally without any medication. detoxification helps in curbing unhealthy cravings for food makes you feel lighter medication if being taken act better and generally promotes a feeling of well being. you can try this with complete switching over to salads and fruits only once a week and drinking plenty of water. for full benefits please adopt naturecure procedures

Question: i am overweight and take synthroid. is it ok to take phentermine (generic for adipex) as well?
Baseline Response: no.
Answer 1: i do not take phenters, i do take phenphentermine.

Expected Response: when you have your prescriptions filled your pharmacist should screen for any potential interactions between these two medications. that is why it is so important that you have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. there are no significant interactions between synthroid and phentermine but you should only take phentermine if your doctor approves.

Question: should you drink milk while taking augmentin to help it better absorb into the system?
Baseline Response: yes, if you have not already taken it.
If you have taken augmentin, you should drink milk for at least 5 minutes.
There is no need to take milk if you are taking an augmentin.
The supplement is not required to be taken once a day, but if you take it every day, you will be taking a dose every 6 hours.
A dose of 50 milligrams of augmentin is taken on the first day of the week.
When you take augmentin on the second day of each month, it will take up to six weeks to reach the maximum dose.
After this, you can take it twice a day.
You should not take augmentit in the same day. It should be taken in the morning and you should not be taking it in the evening.
How does augmentin work?
The mechanism of action of

Expected Response: milk does not enhance the absorption of augmentin. as a matter of fact if you can take it on an empty stomach (some people get a considerable amount of gastrointestinal responses like nausea gastritis or diarrhea when on higher doses) it would absorb better. while taking antibiotics with food is not ideal it is better than not taking it at all.

Expected Response: unfortunately you've missed the open enrollment period for signing up for health insurance for 2015. the next open enrollment period won't come around again until november of this year for health insurance that starts no sooner than january 2016. there is one possible exception however. if when you file your 2014 tax return you learn that you owe a penalty because you did not have insurance in 2014 you may qualify for a special enrollment period that lasts only until april 30th. the idea here is to help you avoid two years in a row of tax penalties for going uninsured. if you think you may eligible for this special enrollment you'll also be eligible for financial assistance as long as your income qualifies you. i suggest you go right away to healthcare. gov to see about signing up for health insurance.

Question: what causes a low white blood cell count?
Baseline Response: the reason white blood cells are so low is because they are often not in the form of cells that are able to produce oxygen, such as mitochondria and other metabolic machinery.
The reason white cells are low is that they are not able to metabolize and release oxygen efficiently.
These metabolic machinery are the cells that make up the body's oxygen supply.
So, the reason we don't see blue blood cells is because we don
The other reason white cell count is low is due to the fact that they aren't able to form and release sufficient oxygen to produce the necessary oxygen for their cells to function.
Therefore, they need oxygen to do their job.
They need oxygen for a lot of things, including, but not limited to, running, walking, and so forth.
This is why we see many white blood blood cells in the body.
For example, we see a large number of blue

Expected Response: white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. as they mature white blood cells are continually released into the bloodstream. white blood cells circulate throughout the body ready to fight infections. they live about two or three weeks when they are broken down and recycled by the body. a normal white blood cell count is between about 4 500 and 10 000 cells per microliter. many conditions can cause a low white blood cell count: • infection (which usually increases the white blood cell count but may decrease it). • drugs especially chemotherapy. • human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). • severe alcohol abuse. • radiation therapy. • cancer affecting the bone marrow. • connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). many african-americans have a naturally lower white blood cell count. this is caused by a gene mutation that may have evolved as a defense against malaria. most often a low white blood cell count is temporary and improves on its own.
================================================================================
Question: what causes parkinson's disease?
Baseline Response: It is a common genetic disorder that causes parkinsons to become smaller and shorter, and this may be caused by the presence of a gene that causes them to become larger. The disease may be inherited from a parent.
Parkinson's is not an autosomal recessive disorder. It is inherited from an inherited genetic disorder. The cause of the disease may not be known until it is discovered.
What causes parkinosis?
Parkinosis is a genetic disorder caused by a defective gene. It may be hereditary or acquired through natural selection.
If you have parkinitis, your genetic condition may be related to the genetic disorder of the parkinoid.
There are four common causes of parkinosclerosis:
1) a genetic disease, including parkinism, a genetic defect in the gene responsible for the parkinsonism, or
2) a disease of the skin that is caused by mutations in the

Expected Response: bodily movements are regulated by a portion of the brain called the basal ganglia whose cells require a proper balance of two substances called dopamine and acetylcholine both involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. in parkinson's cells that produce dopamine begin to degenerate throwing off the balance of these two neurotransmitters. researchers believe that genetics sometimes plays a role in the cellular breakdown. in rare instances parkinson's disease may be caused by a viral infection or by exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides carbon monoxide or the metal manganese. but in the great majority of parkinson's cases the cause is unknown.

Question: daughter tested positive for mono. the only symptom is swollen lymph nodes in her neck. can she play soccer? . she has no fever no swollen spleen no sore throat no fatigue. dr left it up to us whether or not she should play! just want to hear other opinions.
Baseline Response: it seems that her mother does not have a fever.

Expected Response: mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision.
================================================================================
Question: is it ok to use vaseline as a vaginal lubricant?
Baseline Response: It is not. The vaseline does not contain any harmful substances.
The best way to prevent pregnancy is to use the most effective vaginal lubricants available.

Expected Response: vaseline is not the best choice for vaginal lubrication nor is plain ky jelly. there are many good products formulated for this role that are tested on vaginal tissues and stay slippery not sticky/tacky. you can consider trying astroglide the special ky vaginal lubricant--there should be a selection at your local store near condoms or female hygiene products. some women also use sweet almond oil vitamin e oil or even olive oil. but few of the natural oils have been studied for long term vaginal effects.
================================================================================
Question: who is at risk for osteoporosis?
Baseline Response: there are a few things that can affect your risk of osteopora:
1. Your health and health care provider may decide that you are at risk of a fracture.
2. You may not be able to talk to your doctor about osteoporas and you may not have a plan to treat osteoporosias.
3. Your doctor may not prescribe you calcium or vitamin supplements, or you may be denied the use of a bone marrow transplant.
4. Your dentist may not recommend a bone transplant.

Expected Response: talk to your health care provider about your chances for getting osteoporosis. many things put people at risk for osteoporosis. the following people have a higher chance of getting osteoporosis: women who: are going through or who are past menopause (“the change”). are white (caucasian) or asian. people who: are thin. have a family member with osteoporosis. do not get enough calcium or vitamin d. do not exercise. smoke. drink alcohol often. take bone-thinning medicines (such as prednisone) for a long time.
================================================================================
Question: where do i start if i have never exercised?
Baseline Response: I don't know. I'm not really sure.
This is the question that really needs to be answered.
1. Do I need to use a gym membership to get started?
2. Do i need to exercise once a month?
3. Do they cost me anything?
4. I like to exercise and I like being physically active. What do I do with my time?
5. What is the time I should be working out?
6. What does my weight take?
7. Is it okay if I lift heavy?
8. Does my weight gain any weight?
9. Are they too big?
10. How much does my diet consist of?
11. Do my exercise take me longer to finish?
12. Is my diet better than my weight? I'm sorry but I don.
13. Is there a way to get to a gym

Expected Response: if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park further away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. if you prefer a more ambitious routine you can join a gym or try working out at home. try for 30 to 60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity (such as swimming biking walking dancing or jogging) at least three to five times a week. weight training can also help tone your muscles and elevate your resting metabolism rate. (the rate that the body burns fuel for energy) whatever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals.
================================================================================
Question: after tooth extraction do you have to replace with an implant?
Baseline Response: No.

Expected Response: teeth need to be replaced for several reasons. to prevent surrounding teeth from tipping to prevent opposing teeth from extruding for protecting the integrity of your occlusion or bite. it also helps to keep the missing tooth as a one-tooth-problem. if you feel that you do not want an implant there are other options such as bridges and removable dentures. there is also the aesthetic reason if the missing tooth is visible. and you also want to preserve the chewing efficiency of your mouth.
================================================================================
Question: i take hydrocodone 10/660 for pain. is the 10 mg the pain medicine or acetaminophen dosage?
Baseline Response: I take hydroacetic acid 10/760 for pain and I take acetaminone 10 mg for pain pain. I don't have any other pain medications. I take a hydrocolloid 10 mg every day. I have never had any pain.
Answer. I took hydrocudone 10.5 mg every time I was in pain. It took me a week to get over my pain.

Expected Response: the medication that you are on is a combination product that uses two medications to combat pain on two different levels. acetaminophen (660 mg) is an effective pain reliever and is used in combination with the hydrocodone (10 mg). you want to take the medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor or health-care provider.
================================================================================
Question: when is it safe to do heavy lifting and play contact sports after being infected with mono? . i was infected with mono about 4 weeks ago. i am training to enter a police force and need to do vigorous workouts and my doctor hasn't been very revealing about when i can safely go back to working out.
Baseline Response: - i am in the hospital for a few weeks and am getting very sick. i need to get some rest and rest in between work and play, but i am not sure if i will get any better in a few months.

Expected Response: only your doctor can give you that patient-specific "okay" or you will need to be cleared by another doctor. working out may not be an issue four weeks after mono but if your liver and/or spleen is still enlarged (not all people have this mono-related response) you should avoid contact or collision activities that could injury them. it takes an exam and perhaps an ebv titer (blood test) to know your state of recovery. some people improve rapidly and others do not.
================================================================================
Question: causes of nausea tightness around mid-section shortness of breath sweating trembling and pain (not heart or anxiety). heart had been checked 1 year ago with all tests possible and everything perfect. electrocardiogram at emergency room showed no change. have gastroparesis and esophageal spasms but have not had an attack like this before. gall bladder removed 1 1/2 years ago. had slightly elevated white count (had sinus infection) and sligtly low potassium level. woke up in the night with nausea and went downhill from there. a lot of pain and trouble breathing with sweating and trembling hands.
Baseline Response: causes a feeling of dizziness (sitting up in a chair or chair with no legs is an example) and an increase in the temperature of the blood. dizziness is usually accompanied by an increase of blood pressure which is a sign of hypertension.

Expected Response: i am not able to tell what might be going on particularly since you've had quite a few tests in the past. your condition is too complicated to figure out without the benefit of examining you. you need a doctor to examine you and i would be concerned particularly about the shortness of breath and pain/tightness. that is not something you should ignore. i assume when you had your heart checked it was because of these same types of symptoms. however they should still not be ignored and you should give your doctor a call.
================================================================================
Question: after having my appendix removed how long should it be until i have the staples from the surgery removed. (on the intestine/inside)
Baseline Response: after removing the appendix I have been able to walk for 6 months.
Answer 1: I am in a wheelchair.

Expected Response: your surgeon's office should have given you instructions on this. usually though staples come out between 10-21 days after surgery. note this is not a "do-it-yourself" deal. your doctor has a special tool to remove the staples without pain or pulling the wound open. in the meantime keep the incision clean. if your doctor told you to apply antibiotic ointment to the incision do so at least once a day. if your doctor did not tell you to apply any ointment to the incision then just leave it dry. never take a hand-held shower wand and use it to "blast" water on the incision at close range. this is a surefire way to force bacteria into the wound. just allow the shower water to run down over the incision and then pat it dry. remember to take it easy when it comes to lifting. your incision is rather fragile for awhile. in fact it takes about six weeks for scar tissue to equal the strength of sutures (below the skin). so be sure to follow all of your post-op instructions and activity restrictions carefully. wishing you well!
================================================================================
Question: i have not had an erection since my prostate gland was removed five years ago. what can be done to correct this problem? . test results have shown that i have a blood vessel that will not hold the pressure to maintain an erection.
Baseline Response: - I am a very active man, and this is what I do. my partner has not ejaculates. i have never had an orgasm.

Expected Response: if you do have a blood flow issue then you should get great results from penile injection therapy (it does not hurt) or a vacuum erection device. if those do not work for you then you can still have a penile implant placed with great results and very happy patients and their spouses. i assume you are seeing a urologist who can discuss these and other options with you. if not you should. if these options were not discussed you may want to seek out urologists who have specialized their practice in ed.

Question: i am a15 year old boy. height=160cm weight=34 kg. please suggest a diet or exercise to gain weight. is yoga suitable? . how to overcome the situation of being underweight. is exercise (weight lifting) useful for gaining weight as per my condition. is running any good? what kind of food should i consume.
Baseline Response: i would recommend to use food to boost your body's growth, which will help you to achieve your goals. and to use as many different foods as possible.
I am 21 years old and have been doing yoga for 2 years. i am in a poor mood and have not started the exercise regimen yet. i want to get rid of the weight i have accumulated. i have started to get tired and need to go to bed. i will try to do this in the evening. i need to get up a little at night. i feel a little sluggish. i wish to go for a walk and to do yoga.

Expected Response: hi you really do need to look at your body make up before you go adding weight if you do have a very small frame then your weight could be right for it. did a check and its says your underweight but see there is always a but this can not be relied on you should really see your own doctor and go from there before you go packing on the ponds. but weight lifting is very good for you as is body building for you at 15 this may be a good way to go but keep off protein drinks or foods for now just stick to drinking extra milk and on training days do drink an extra one after your workout eat a couple of bananas a day but add some weight slowly slowly. but you should really see your doctor and see just how much weight he says you do need to gain and work with him checking your gains. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what is rheumatoid arthritis and how is it different from "old age" arthritis?
Baseline Response: rheumatic arthritis is a degenerative disease that is characterized by arthritis, inflammation and inflammation of the joints. rheumatism is a condition in which a portion of the body is injured in the joints and the rest is not. rhea is a disease in which the disease progresses to arthritis. rhesus is a type of inflammation in which there is a loss of muscle or connective tissue, or joint, and there is an abnormal amount of redness or inflammation.
Answer : rheuma is a form of arthritis that is common in older adults. rhemorrhoea is a chronic inflammation of a small area of the brain. rhelioma is a inflammation of nerves, or nerves that are damaged by a nerve injury.

Expected Response: rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn on itself attacking tissue that normally helps protect and preserve joint function. during an ra "attack" -- known as a flare -- the immune system sends out a barrage of white blood cells to the affected joint which in turn causes inflammation in the area. it is this inflammation that is responsible for the symptoms of ra including joint swelling and pain. osteoarthritis also known as "old age arthritis" or "wear and tear arthritis" is a natural degeneration of the cartilage between joints that occurs with aging. the degeneration can be worsened by overuse or injury but its impact is limited to the affected joints.

Baseline Response: i have a severe rash that i had on my head, and i took a lot of medication. i have been on the medication for about 2 weeks. i did nothing to stop the rash. its gone out of my system and i feel like its gone. i took 3 different things. 1. i started taking the drug in order to stop my rash. 2. i used the medication and 2. had no symptoms. 3. i bought the medication at a pharmacy. i felt good and i had no problems with my rash, but i did feel as if i was getting a bad

Expected Response: unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to diagnosis a rash without actually seeing it first-hand. a description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call and without a diagnosis treatment suggestions would also not be possible. you will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist so that you can be be properly diagnosed and treated. are you just interested on creams and drugs which are useful to cure your skin problem or else any other source which can cure it. it is necessary to consult a dermatologist to judge on what type of rash you are suffering from and have to treat it. but before that why can't you just try products which can cure your skin problem naturally. usage of products with natural ingredients can help you to recover from many type of skin problems. best you can have from online search are products made out of argan nuts which might give positive results than other. you may try applying home remedies like paste from papayas or avocados. these home remedies may take longer time to work but are definitely safer for your sensitive skin. you may also look for hypoallergenic products that will not cause irritation to your skin. www. clearclinic. com - <link>

A garden can be built from scratch.
For many people, a home can look like:
A few simple steps:
Use a piece of wood or a piece more than a foot in length, and cut into two pieces.
Use an old wooden

Question: what’s the best diet for great glutes?
Baseline Response: I can't answer that directly. I'm not a big fan of eating too much, but I do eat a lot of protein. I do think it helps improve the glutes, but it does tend to be too high in carbs. I think that's a big part of what makes the diet so good.
In my opinion, I think it's not a bad diet because I know what I'm doing and I know it works for me. I don't really eat too much protein, but if I'm at the gym and I'm in a good shape, I'll probably eat more protein.
What do you think of the diet that you choose for the gluteal muscles?
I don't know how you guys feel about it. I feel like it's a lot more weight loss than what I thought I would.
As far as the diet, I'd say I like the same

Expected Response: quality: stick to whole foods. abandon processed and refined products because they’re not real food just “food-like” products. i like to call them science fair projects. most are laced with refined sugars that play havoc with your insulin levels resulting in a never-ending appetite for more junk. keep it simple. veggies fruits lean proteins and whole grains. eat smart fats that are healthy and satisfying like avocados and nuts. don’t forget to combine protein and fiber like a high protein greek yogurt with walnuts and blueberries. quantity: even if you’re eating whole foods you still have to rein in the calories and control your portions. steamed raw and grilled veggies especially the watery ones you can feast on. watery not densely sugared fruits are best (apples oranges berries melons). be careful with the whole grains especially bread products rice and pasta. make sure you read the labels and stick with one serving when you eat. you’ll need 4-6 oz of lean protein at any one sitting. frequency: eat a balanced meal or snack every 3-4 hours. if you do you’ll feel satisfied enough to eat less throughout the day resulting in more rapid and effective weight removal. make sure to cut off eating after dinner (which should be ideally no later than 8pm). or if you’re up and moving around after dinner and are truly hungry a 100-150 calorie healthy snack is acceptable like a yogurt or cottage cheese or an ounce of cheese.

Question: the day after my period ended i had sex with my bf he inserted his penis for a minute before putting condom on. . can i get pregnant even though it was right after my period? i've been nauseous and getting some cramps for about a week now.
Baseline Response: no, but i had some minor cramps, and i decided to put it on, and he was happy. I'm a bit upset, because i don't think it's the best idea to have sex with your husband, but it does make me feel better.

Expected Response: yes it is always possible. before a man orgasms he can release "pre-ejaculate" which is sperm and can get you pregnant. if you're on another method of birth control such as the pill iud depo provera nuva ring etc your chances are decreased. best way to tell is to either get a home pregnancy urine test or ask your doc for a lab slip for beta hcg blood testing.

Question: at what age or point is the t-score in bone density scans used instead of a z-score?
Baseline Response: the t, which is the ratio between the t and z in the blood, is the measurement of the level of bone density in a human being. The z-ray, which measures the bone density of a person, is used to determine the level that the person is in. If the z-rays are too low, the person may be dead. In the case of bone densities of more than 10,000, the z can be considered to be too low. The same can be said for the z. This means that there is a difference between the level in bone mass of a human and that of a mammal.
Answer 2: How many t-points in bone-density scans do you have?

Expected Response: a z-score compares your bone density to what is normal for someone your age. while a z-score alone is not used to diagnose osteoporosis in premenopausal women it can provide important information. here are some tips to help you understand your z-score: *if your z-score is above -2. 0 your bone density is considered within the ranges expected for your age or normal according to the international society for clinical densitometry (iscd). for example a z-score of 0. 5 -0. 5 and -1. 5 is considered normal for most premenopausal women. *if your z-score is -2. 0 or lower your bone density is considered below the expected range. examples are -2. 1 -2. 3 and -2. 5. if your z-score is in this range your health-care provider will consider your health history and possible causes of bone loss including secondary osteoporosis before making a diagnosis of osteoporosis. *if your z-score is normal but you've broken one or more bones from a minor injury your health-care provider may diagnose you with osteoporosis because some people with normal bone density break bones easily. as mentioned above a bone density test will also show a t-score. a t-score compares bone density to what is normal in a healthy 30-year-old adult.

Expected Response: i had the same thing happen to me while pregnant. my daughter is 1 now and perfectly healthy. you have to remember your body is sensitive now since you are pregnant. sex will make you bleed some times. you may even cramp. as long as it is light spotting or just a little blood you will be fine. when to worry would be heavy bleeding no movement and pain so bad you cant stand upright. i promise you will be ok <positive_smiley>

Question: clitoris paincan't stand touch. found a white thing under hood and now i know why it hurts what can i do about it? . been to many docs they said it's normal. orgasms hurt touch hurts sitting hurts. my sex life is ruined. i didn't have pain when i was younger. looked at it today and there is a white thing maybe ripped skin is it fixable? i am very concerned! . i also have something that is getting bigger by the day in my vagina. whatever it is blocks entry. i had stage 4 cervical can er a few years ago it burns to touch. refuse to see docs here they are horrible i think it will kill me what can it be?
Baseline Response: I think that it's probably more of a problem with the skin around the penis. I don't know if it's the skin or something else but it seems to be getting bigger. I can't imagine having that happen to me.
Answer 1:

Expected Response: hi the white thing under the hood could be a cyst and if i'm right you could try this in a very hot bath try just squeezing it to see if it pops but if a real old cyst then it a lump you may need to see a gyno about removal. your vaginal blockage could be a prolapse and what you feeling could be your cervix as you wont see a doctor if you can find a good gyno he should be able to help with both of your problems. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: what are the treatment options for low estrogen levels in a young woman? . i have had depression for the past 10 months and always felt that it was hormonal. about a month ago i got diagnosed with an ovarian cyst and it got me thinking that i should get my hormone levels tested to see if that was the cause of my depression. i got a saliva hormone test done and the results showed that i had menopausal levels of estrogen (i'm only 21! ). are saliva hormone tests acurate? what are my treatment options? should i share my results with my doctor and see what she thinks?
Baseline Response: yes.
This is an important question because it is a very important question. It is important to know your doctor. If you feel that your hormones are low, there are many treatments for you to choose from.
When I started my treatment, I was very worried that I would not have the testosterone I need to have a normal life. I would be afraid of

Expected Response: the low estrogen level could be the result of stress hormones on the brain and not early menopause. depression can cause alterations in the complex interaction of hormones that result in monthly periods. restoring balance into your life by treating depression might be all you need to regularize your periods. yet other hormones should also be analyzed. simple blood or urine test are needed to determine whether this is the result of depression or something directly hormonal. premature ovarian failure elevated prolactin levels thyroid disease etc occasionally more specialized stimulation test are needed as is a referral to a hormone specialist such as an endocrinologist or reproductive endocrinologist. for now protecting your bones is utterly important until a definite diagnosis is made. a diet rich in calcium vitamin d and estrogen are considerations to prevent bone loss and restore periods. birth control is an option given your age but a more intensive evaluation is needed first.

Question: the zoloft my doctor prescribed five weeks ago isn't working. i've been referred to a psychiatrist. what can i expect?
Baseline Response: it's hard to say.
I've had a couple of treatments and it seems that it's getting better. I'm trying to get it started again, but it's a long road.
So what's the best way to get your doctor to change your medication and get it back to normal?
I have a prescription for the Zoloft Zolomile. I have a 2 week prescription for it.
They've been doing this for a couple years.
Why does the medicine look different than the one you've tried?
It's different.
What are the benefits of this medicine?
There's a lot of things that you'll notice about this medicine.
First off, it's much better for you.
It relieves symptoms of the symptoms that you've had for a long time.

Expected Response: psychiatrists unlike psychologists don't usually use any type of formal questionnaire/tests. it's usually just an interview that can be as long as one hour or as short as 15 minutes. this can be an indication of nothing really and depending on where you go it can be an indication of how long the patient waiting list currently happens to be. of course you have problems and the psychiatrist expects you to have them because you're being referred by someone. so that's a given. the fact that your med hasn't worked in five weeks may indicate that it's too low a dose or isn't the med for you. all of this depends on the psychiatrist's experience and training.

Expected Response: hi try these for help. vitamin e is vital to scalp circulation and cell regeneration both necessary for hair growth. the daily recommended dose is 15 to 19mg. vitamin c is a natural antioxidant and helps maintain healthy hair. it aids in synthesis of collagen and is readily available in the diet. the daily recommended dose is 90 to 120mg. biotin deserves special mention. it is also a b vitamin but its importance in the role of hair growth cannot be overstated. while it can be consumed it was once said by clinical researcher andrew lessman that thousands of calories would have to be eaten to get the amount of biotin needed to make a difference. it promotes hair growth and is crucial to prevent hair dryness. the daily recommended dose is 30mcg. b complex just as the name suggests the bs are complex. there are many of them and some of them depend on one another in order to function. b12 can be responsible for hair loss by itself simply due to a deficiency. frequently injections of b12 can resolve hair loss issues. it is not stored well by the body and is required for the body's use of oxygen and for metabolism. it is needed for activation of b6 and helps in creating niacin. b12 is most absorbable when taken with vitamin c and the daily recommended dose is 50mg. b6 is also thought to prevent hair loss. it also aids in hair coloring and has a major role in creation of niacin which is needed for healthy circulation. b6 must be entirely obtained through diet or supplementation because the human body cannot synthesize it by itself. the daily recommended dose ranges from 1. 3 to 2mg. b3 also known as niacin is thought to reduce cholesterol in the scalp which inhibits hair growth. it is also essential for healthy blood circulation to the body and scalp. the daily recommended dose is 16 to 18mg. vitamin a is an antioxidant that aids in scalp oil production. it's important to note that excess amounts of vitamin a can have undesirable effects by inhibiting hair growth and can even be toxic. the daily recommended dose is 5 000 iu however the linus pauling institute of oregon university has noted increased risk of developing bone diseases such as osteoporosis associated with 5 000iu intake and therefore some supplement manufacturers have reduced content to 2 500i this above info come from livestrong com once a month you could also try giving your hair the olive oil treatment leave it on for a hour before washing it out great for hair health. do hope this helps you and your hair. good luck

Question: would signing up for obamacare save me costs on my blue cross supplement? i am currently on medicare.
Baseline Response: no.
It's not a problem.
There are no big savings on the insurance that comes with signing up.
I've seen a lot of people say that the cost of a year's coverage is going to be $100 less.
That's right.
The cost of insurance is not a cost.
So, I think the best thing that can be done is to buy insurance for the first time.
If you're willing to sign up for a free plan, you can get it.
You can get a policy for $1,000.
But, if you want to get a free policy, you'll have to pay a premium.
Why would I need to pay $100 for insurance for a year?
I don't know.
No, no. I'm not going to need to spend $100 on insurance

Question: why do i have gray pubic hair at the age of 43
Baseline Response: because it's so hard to do. I have been using my pubic hairs for about 5 years now. I don't even know if it's a problem or not. I just like the look of it. I'm a bit of a tomboy but I like to try new things.
I love the look but it's not as fun as a pubic beard. I guess it's just a matter of time before I can get my hair in.
What do you think about this?

Expected Response: i don't know. the greying and whiting of hair is usually genetically determined so blame it on your parents or grand-parents. my head hair turned grey in my 30's and by my mid-40's i was as white as snow. if you don't like grey pubic hair shave it off. or dye it a different color. or just ignore it as part of our progressive aging cycle.

I also have a free recipe for making it with a little bit of cooking oil. The food processor I use is the same one that I use for the crockpot. I have no idea how to make it from scratch.
How to Make It
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Place the chicken thighs in a large bowl and whisk until they are completely coated. Add the chicken, and whisk again until the chicken is completely coated, about 2 minutes.
3. Place chicken in the crockspot and add the flour.
4. Add in the dry ingredients.
5. Turn the heat down to medium.
6. Place a lid on the crocker pot, and let it

Expected Response: it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food

Question: can cocoa butter on skin raise cholesterol
Baseline Response: not really. I've been using cocoa butter for about 3 years now, and I've always had a pretty strong aversion to it. So I've decided to try it out. I'm not sure if I've ever felt more confident about the effects of cocoa butter, but I do like the idea that it's a better option than the other ingredients in my diet.

Expected Response: cocoa butter is not absorbed through the skin into the systemic circulation so it should not have any adverse effects on your cholesterol.

Answer - I am not certain that I am a man, but it is possible. I'm not sure that I can have sex without the help of the "male" who is not my

Expected Response: assuming you had unprotected sex. and are not taking any form of birth control then the answer is yes. you can be pregnant. you can take a home pregnancy test anytime; repeat it again in one week if it is negative. if you miss the next cycle and your pregnancy test is still negative ask your medical provider to order a more sensitive blood pregnancy test. if a pregnancy was not in your plans why not use contraception and avoid all of this angst?

Baseline Response: yes, the medications are good for the baby, but if the baby is not breathing, it is unlikely that they will cause any harm.
Answer to

Expected Response: most asthma medicines are considered safe and are used in children. for example albuterol is sometimes used in babies and young infants if they have an asthma type reaction. speak to your doctor about your specific medicines to get more information. most medications used to treat asthma appear to be safe especially those that have been around for many years and have been time-tested. unfortunately it is very difficult to conduct adequate studies in pregnant women to prove the safety of drugs.

Question: what factors place women at high risk for heart disease?
Baseline Response: many factors have been identified, but there are many more that are not yet known. The primary reason for this is that many of the factors are not understood or considered in a systematic way. Therefore, we present an attempt to explain the health effects of different types of heart disease.
The following are some of the main factors that could affect the health of women with heart disease:
1. Women with heart diseases may develop diabetes or other diseases, which may affect their health
2. Women may experience problems with weight gain
3. Women who have had breast cancer may develop breast cancer
4. Women have low HDL cholesterol levels
5. Women are more likely to have diabetes mellitus
6. Women experience a higher risk for hypertension
7. Women develop a higher blood pressure
8. Women live longer than men
9. Women often have high blood pressure (including hypertension)
10. Women regularly

Question: what vitamins are needed for 11 thru 18 old girls that refuse to eat breakfast lunch live on bean burritos. no vegatable
Baseline Response: they are not vegan
Answer #2: No, they are vegan

Expected Response: any multivitamin is fine. some are formulated just for teenagers. a health food store can help you select one. the issue is not just vitamins but basic nutrition. many teenagers and pre-teens dabble with becoming vegetarians but have absolutely no idea on how to do it nor do they have a knowledge of general nutrition. make them attend a class on vegetarian lifestyle. also watch their weight carefully. weight loss or obsession with weight can signal an eating disorder.

Question: how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?
Baseline Response: hypothyroxinemia is the diagnosis of hypothyrosclerosis. It is caused by the breakdown of the thyroid and is usually caused by an overactive thyroid gland. Hypothyroidosis is caused when a person's thyroid is too weak to function properly.
Symptoms: hypomania, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar are common symptoms of hypomanic hypothyrophy.
Causes: The hypothyrotoxic syndrome is caused because of the hypothyronism of the body, which is caused due to the breakdown and breakdown of thyroid hormones. The thyroid is underdeveloped and the body is unable to produce enough thyroid hormones to maintain normal thyroid function.
Treatment: The treatment for hypothyropyrophy is medication to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone that is produced by the thyroid.
How to get help: Visit our website at: www.pennedaily.com

Expected Response: if you have symptoms of hypothyroidism your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. these may include: thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) t4 (thyroxine) lower-than-normal t4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. however some people may have increased tsh levels while having normal t4 levels. this is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. it is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. if your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan to check for nodules or inflammation.

Question: sharp back neck and arm pain on the left side. this began suddenly about 12 hours ago. the pain worsens with movement such as using my left arm turning my head to the left or lifting my head in general. the main spot of pain feels like it's near my spine just under my left shoulderblade. if i sneeze the pain shoots up and down on my spine and out to my left arm occasionally leaving a numbness in my left hand. i am not an "active" person i primarilly work at my computer every day.
Baseline Response: Answer 1:
If you are having a bad back and neck pain, use a pain reliever that is effective in relieving the pain.

Question: is hpv contagious?
Baseline Response: It is not contagious.
Answer : it is contagious.

Expected Response: hpv or human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted disease. it's usually detected as warts in the genital area of women and men. hpv is a serious disease that can cause several types of cancer including cervical cancer. hpv most certainly is contagious. hpv is transmitted by direct sexual contact with a person who has the virus. unfortunately many people who have hpv do not know it because they have no symptoms. using a condom during sexual encounters may help minimize your risk of getting hpv from a sex partner. two vaccines have been developed in recent years that can protect you from getting hpv. the vaccines will not cure hpv if you already have it. the centers for disease control and prevention recommend young women and men receive the vaccine to protect against getting and spreading hpv. you may want to speak with your healthcare provider to get more information about hpv and the two vaccines. hpv is contagious. there is a vaccine for girls but there is not one for boys. also i don't think there is a test that males can take to find out if they have hpv - but there is one for girls.

Remove medicines that have not been prescribed
Take any medicines that you have taken
If you have any of the following symptoms, your doctor may want to consider:
The number of hours you

Expected Response: what do i mean by touch? well touch is everything from sheets to your mattress and to your pillow. there’s lots of different theories and thoughts out there but one of the things i can tell you is that if you’re not comfortable on the surface on which you sleep and the system in which you sleep you will get a bad night’s rest. and that’s one of the things i talk about with my my boomers is you know let’s make that bed as comfortable as possible. most people don’t know this statistic and it’s kind of gross but so i’m gonna warn you but the weight of your mattress will double every 7 to 8 years based on oil sweat and dust mites. it’s pretty gross but the truth of that matter is people don’t change their mattress enough. you can only imagine what this does to your pillow. so you need to be changing your pillow probably about once every 18 – 24 months you need to be changing your mattress about every 7 years. sheets are another factor. the truth of the matter is sheets anything over 450 threads it’s almost impossible to get more than 450 – 500 threads in a square inch and that’s how they measure sheets by thread counts. there is a thread count myth out there. if you buy a 1 000 thread count sheet it’s actually 2 500 thread count woven together. so it may last a little bit longer but it’s not going to get you any softer than a 450 to 500 thread count sheet.

Question: how can i prevent a sting reaction?
Baseline Response: no, you can't.
If you feel like you're in a sting, don't be afraid to ask the person to leave the room.
Be sure to tell the person immediately if they're feeling like they're in the sting.
Try to get your partner to leave, but make sure they're not taking any actions that could be harming their feelings.
Do not let the person leave you alone.
Make sure you have a clean room, safe room and comfortable area for your partner.
The reason you're scared of a sting is because you're afraid of it.
A sting reaction is when you feel the sting and you can feel it. It's when you have to take action.
It's when the person feels the sting, and you are forced to act.
To help prevent a stinging reaction, you need to be aware of what you're doing.
You don't want to

Expected Response: to avoid a serious reaction to a bee or wasp sting carry a bee-sting kit (be sure you know how to administer a self-injection). you should also wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace describing your allergy. if you have had a severe reaction to a sting and a positive venom skin test venom immunotherapy -- a series of weekly shots of venom -- works well to prevent anaphylaxis. reduce your chances of being stung by avoiding brightly colored white or pastel clothing. don't use cosmetics or perfume with floral scents. food odors attract insects especially yellow jackets so be alert when you are cooking or eating outdoors.

Question: what is the common cold and what causes it?
Baseline Response: The common cold is a serious illness caused by a viral infection. The virus can cause a variety of illnesses including pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis and even meningiitis.
The common cold can also affect the immune system, including the blood, which is the main source of blood. The common round is caused by an infection called the herpes simplex virus. It is a viral virus that is caused through a virus called the E.coli virus.
People who have the common round are more likely to develop meningococcal pneumonia and pneumoniae. This is caused when a person's immune system is weakened. Meningococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial infection that can cause meningosclerosis in the gut and may also cause pneumoniae in the mouth and throat.
What causes the common flat?
The flat is caused mainly by a common viral infection called E. coli. It may be caused

Expected Response: the common cold is a self-limited contagious illness that can be caused by a number of different types of viruses. the common cold is medically referred to as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. symptoms of the common cold may include cough sore throat nasal congestion runny nose and sneezing. more than 200 different types of viruses are known to cause the common cold with rhinovirus causing approximately 30%-35% of all adult colds. other commonly implicated viruses include coronavirus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. because so many different viruses can cause a cold and because new cold viruses constantly develop the body never builds up resistance against all of them. for this reason colds are a frequent and recurring problem. in fact children in preschool and elementary school can have six to 12 colds per year while adolescents and adults typically have two to four colds per year. the common cold occurs most frequently during the fall and winter months. the common cold is the most frequently occurring illness in the world and it is a leading cause of doctor visits and missed days from school and work. it is estimated that individuals in the united states suffer 1 billion colds per year with approximately 22 million days of school absences recorded annually.

Question: what are some physical symtoms that are caused by thyroid disease? . i was diagnosed with hypothyroid disease i have 13 nodules that are enlarged on the thyroid. i have had some biopsies which all came back negative. i have joint pain and read that could be caused by lack of thyroid hormone.
Baseline Response: thyroid disease is a disease caused by the thyroid gland. This is why it is important to check thyroid hormone levels in your thyroid gland to find out if your thyroid is affected by thyroid diseases.

Expected Response: hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can cause many symptoms. you asked about joint pain - yes joint pain and muscle aches can occur in people who are hypothyroid. other common symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain fatigue feeling cold constipation dry hair and skin and slow heart rate. here is a link to an article with more info- <link> take care

Question: can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?
Baseline Response: There are several ways to prevent arrhythmias, including:
1. Exercise
1: Exercise is one of the most common ways to treat a cardiac arrhymatosis. Exercise increases the blood flow to the heart and helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes.
2. Sexual activity
2: Sexual activity is one way to treat an arrhydmia. Sexual activities can cause arrhynchogenic heart attacks, such as heart attack or stroke, which can be treated with a combination of physical activity and medications.
3. Stress Reduction
3: Stress reduction is one possible treatment for an arrhymia. Stress reduction can help to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.
4. Exercise and stress reduction
4: Exercise and exercise reduce the number of heart attacks by up to 20%. Exercise can also reduce the heart rate by up into the 70's.

Expected Response: hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: why do you take some medicines on an empty stomach and at the same time every day?
Baseline Response: it is a very important question. It is also a question of self-awareness.

Expected Response: some medications have to be taken on an empty stomach because it helps the medication dissolve and get into your bloodstream quicker. certain medications need to be taken around the same time every day so you have a consistent level in your bloodstream and body. a good example of this is blood pressure medications -- you should take your dose at the same time each day so you benefit from the medication. if you ever have any questions about how to take your medications ask your pharmacist. we are happy to help.

My partner is very happy. My partner is a very happy man.
Is my partner going to have any problems with my genital herpes because of my genital HPV?
My HPV is a type of cancer that can occur in the cervix. It's a very rare disease, and it's a risk factor for genital herpes.
How does the herpes virus affect my partner?
This is a big question. It depends on the type of genital HPV you have.
My genital HPV is about the same as my partner's. I

Expected Response: the biggest impact of genital herpes is usually emotional. painful symptoms limitations on sexual activity and that it's an incurable lifelong condition can lead to depression. if your partner is pregnant or trying to get pregnant however genital herpes is a major concern. her doctor must be made aware of it. genital herpes is also more serious for people with hiv and other conditions that weaken the immune system. you may have heard that genital herpes causes cervical cancer. that's not exactly true. it may be a factor but it's not the main cause.

Why are there so many people in the world who think measles is a disease?
How can I get measles-related symptoms?
Do I need to get my child vaccinated?
Is there a chance that I will be sick enough to get measles?

Expected Response: many rashes look similar to measles but a vaccinated child at age 12 months should not be contracting measles unless there was a confirmed direct exposure. measles is uncommon in the u. s. now but i do not know where you live. have her examined by her medical provider and read a bit more about the signs and symptoms of measles on webmd. a rash is not the only sign.

Question: i have another question for rod moser pa phd re: partial hysterectomy question previously posted. the person who presented the story about the 40 yr old woman w partial hysterectomy is very distraught over losing this child they even named her. he never was at any appts with her she said she had an ultrasound but there was no pic he has seen no pregnancy test or labs. he says she has 2 small incisions one by the belly button and one on her left side. is there any medical documentation he could ask for to prove her story? .
Baseline Response: no. he has only seen a few pictures of her. but he is still interested in the baby. she is very sad.
Answer 1: no, she is not pregnant. she was not given any hormones. she has no history of cancer. she would have been in the hospital without her ovaries. she had no other complications.

Expected Response: sometimes a person wants to be pregnant so desperately that their brain creates a false-pregnancy. i had one patient who had a complete hysterectomy that even sent out birth announcements and started wearing pregnancy clothes. she wanted a miracle birth where none could exist. could it be that this person was experiencing a similar false-pregancy and a "loss" of that pregnancy? this person may have lost a "child" that never really existed except in her own mind. i do not know any of the details of this case as you know so i can only speculate. if there is medical evidence like ultrasound results pregnancy tests etc. only she has the right to reveal it. or not. she may need some psychological help not trouble her for documentation to prove or disprove her story. she has experienced a loss but perhaps the loss was her inability to ever have a child because of the hysterectomy. this can be very very difficult for a woman who wanted a child so desperately that her mind may have created one. i trust that you will approach this with sensitivity and understanding. my heart goes out to all of you.

Question: i ache all the time mostly my neck shoulders arms and hands and tired all the time. bloodwork came back good
Baseline Response: My neck was not broken for 4 weeks. I had a lot of blood work and I had to go to the hospital. I felt like I had had my neck broken. I'm pretty sure that I was hit by a car and it's just that I had no idea it was a car. My neck is a little bit swollen but I can tell it's not a car, I'm not going to let it get to me.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. the symptoms you're describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue. spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age (though i don't know how old you are) and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone. either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs. i'd suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted. blood work won't help diagnose a spinal injury or degenerative disc disease. i wish you all the best! i suffer the same symptons pains in the neck and both shoulders leading down to the top of my left arm i have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis and spondylitis in my hips and knees i have always had trouble with slipped discs and repetitive strains don't help the matter i have tried tramadol robaxing nurofen codeine and paracetomol. the symptons you have mentioned does probably lead to an injured disc which you may of done recently or some time ago get checked out by a chiropractor or ask your doctor to refer you for physio i am waiting on results from mri scan to determine what damage i have done. hope this helps

Baseline Response: I would recommend that you take at least 2 weeks before taking any drug, as you may have an increased risk of infection.
For the most part, the most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and diarrhea and constipation. However, if you are taking the drug twice a day, or you have other side effects, you may need to take at a later time.

Question: does penile massage work. i am a 56 yr old male and have had shrinkage over the last year. does the massage help or is there anything possible to stop it and bring it back to what was normal. this just might be a very stupid? but very concerened.
Baseline Response: I have a 25 yr old female friend who was very much in love with me when I first started working at the clinic. She was having a very difficult time getting my body back into shape. She is still having some issues and the massage seems to be helping her out.
I have a 26 yr old man who was having trouble getting his penis back to normal. he has had a lot of problems with his penis. He has had problems with ejaculation and ejaculation issues. I have had a few prostate issues.
After a few days of this, I felt pretty good and started getting my penis back in shape. I went to the ER and had a very good consultation

Expected Response: penis massage sounds suspiciously like plain 'ol masturbation and no it will not enlarge or restore your penis other than getting an erection. are you doing this yourself or paying someone to do it for you? if you are paying i would advise you to save your money. talk to your doctor or better yet a urologist. there may be a few things that can be done to help you but you may need a few diagnostic tests.

Question: was it a miscarriage if there was a lot of bleeding and something jelly like when using the restroom to change her pad? . my fiancee and i is not sure if she was pregnant but when she believed she had her period she had massive bleeding to the point that it would leak out from the side of her pad and when she used the restroom to change pads something jelly like about 4inches came out of her vagina as well. our parents are old-fashioned japanese and because we are not married yet only engaged we can't just go to the hospital plus i live in japan and she lives in n. y. . what should i do or what should she do?
Baseline Response: If she was having her period, we will go to an OB to see if she has a problem. If she had a hard time getting her period started she should see an obstetrician or an obstetrical surgeon. If her period was caused by any cause and they could not tell us

Expected Response: hi question if she's in ny why cant she go to an er? it would be between her and the doctor she sees unless she's underage? but if your that worried then you should be by her side. what she sore may just have been her uterus lining it can happens to women from time to time most of the time women don't even know this happens or see it pass. if it had been a miscarriage she would have seen flesh and skin. do hope this helps. good luck

Question: been on birth control for almost a year but i've been having pregnancy symptoms? . i've been on loloestrinfe since last september and have not had a period since then which i believe is normal for that medication. over the past few days i've been really constipated had cramps and when i've wiped there's been a little bit of light pink. and i have no idea what it is? my boyfriend and i have sex without condoms but i've never missed a pill. a lot of times it's rough/deep sex and i've had cramping before from him hitting my cervix but i've never had the light pink symptom?

Question: i have stretch marks on my calves inner thighs and hips. cocoa butter diminished the redness. what else will help?
Baseline Response: i think cocoa butter is going to help with the red spots. i think i could use a little bit of a dose of cocoa butter.
I've heard that some people have reported that they feel like they have red spots on their calves. I have seen no evidence of this. I think that maybe they are just getting used to it.
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
My husband, who has a lot of red spots, told me he has been experiencing some discomfort in his thighs. He says he feels like he has a "chubby" feeling around his thighs, and his thighs are not very tight. I can't tell you how many times I've seen him complain about his thighs feeling tight and "stuck" and he has also been having trouble with his thighs getting a proper stretch.

Expected Response: congratulations on your weight loss! unfortunately one of the side effects of such weight loss is the appearance of stretch marks. stretch marks are a form of a scar and as such will never completely go away. using creams and lotions will help to minimize their appearance as will the passage of time but unfortunately your skin will never return to its pre-stretch-mark state.

Question: i see that aloe is in my diet pill i thought that was for wounds. is it safe and does it work?
Baseline Response: I think it works. i have had a lot of pain with it. i am not sure if it works or not. i dont know if it is safe or not, but it is very effective and helps me with my pain.
1.9.1 I am seeing a lot more people on the forums. I will update this post once it has been updated.
I hope you guys get the results you're looking for.
Thanks!
i hope you enjoyed this post.

Expected Response: actually. aloe is a product that topically is okay but when you take it orally it's not. we have found out that it is a very very strong laxative and oral use shouldn't really not happen. so i would advise this patient to not take that product at all and avoid it. aloe can be a weight loss regimen because it has the ability to clean the colon. cleaning out the colon will definitely improve your energy level and can make your weight loss efforts more productive. no surgery fat process - <link>

Question: what other conditions can cause dementia?
Baseline Response: there are many factors which may be involved.
Answer 1: There are many conditions which are related to Alzheimer's Disease. For example, there are certain medications which can cause the loss of the memory, which can lead to memory loss, which is a condition which is more common in people with Alzheimer's. These medications may cause the damage to the brain, which in turn, can lead the brain to deteriorate.
Solution:
If you have Alzheimer's disease, there is a risk that it can cause damage to your brain.
If your brain is damaged, you may not be able to get back to normal.
The following are some of the more common symptoms of Alzheimer's:
- Loss of motor coordination.
- Brain fog.
These symptoms can lead you to believe that you are being watched or controlled.
This may lead to the belief that you have dementia.
Your doctor may also need to look

Expected Response: doctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. many of these conditions are reversible with appropriate treatment. reactions to medications. medications can sometimes lead to reactions or side effects that mimic dementia. these dementia-like effects can occur in reaction to just one drug or they can result from drug interactions. they may have a rapid onset or they may develop slowly over time. metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. thyroid problems can lead to apathy depression or dementia. hypoglycemia a condition in which there is not enough sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion or personality changes. too little or too much sodium or calcium can also trigger mental changes. some people have an impaired ability to absorb vitamin b12 which creates a condition called pernicious anemia that can cause personality changes irritability or depression. tests can determine if any of these problems are present. nutritional deficiencies. deficiencies of thiamine (vitamin b1) frequently result from chronic alcoholism and can seriously impair mental abilities in particular memories of recent events. severe deficiency of vitamin b6 can cause a neurological illness called pellagra that may include dementia. deficiencies of vitamin b12 also have been linked to dementia in some cases. dehydration can also cause mental impairment that can resemble dementia. infections. many infections can cause neurological symptoms including confusion or delirium due to fever or other side effects of the body's fight to overcome the infection. meningitis and encephalitis which are infections of the brain or the membrane that covers it can cause confusion sudden severe dementia withdrawal from social interaction impaired judgment or memory loss. untreated syphilis also can damage the nervous system and cause dementia. in rare cases lyme disease can cause memory or thinking difficulties. people in the advanced stages of aids also may develop a form of dementia (see hiv-associated dementia page 14). people with compromised immune systems such as those with leukemia and aids may also develop an infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). pml is caused by a common human polyomavirus jc virus and leads to damage or destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells. pml can lead to confusion difficulty with thinking or speaking and other mental problems. subdural hematomas. subdural hematomas or bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer covering (the dura) can cause dementia-like symptoms and changes in mental function. poisoning. exposure to lead other heavy metals or other poisonous substances can lead to symptoms of dementia. these symptoms may or may not resolve after treatment depending on how badly the brain is damaged. people who have abused substances such as alcohol and recreational drugs sometimes display signs of dementia even after the substance abuse has ended. this condition is known as substance-induced persisting dementia. brain tumors. in rare cases people with brain tumors may develop dementia because of damage to their brains. symptoms may include changes in personality psychotic episodes or problems with speech language thinking and memory. anoxia. anoxia and a related term hypoxia are often used interchangeably to describe a state in which there is a diminished supply of oxygen to an organ's tissues. anoxia may be caused by many different problems including heart attack heart surgery severe asthma smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation high-altitude exposure strangulation or an overdose of anesthesia. in severe cases of anoxia the patient may be in a stupor or a coma for periods ranging from hours to days weeks or months. recovery depends on the severity of the oxygen deprivation. as recovery proceeds a variety of psychological and neurological abnormalities such as dementia or psychosis may occur. the person also may experience confusion personality changes hallucinations or memory loss. heart and lung problems. the brain requires a high level of oxygen in order to carry out its normal functions. therefore problems such as chronic lung disease or heart problems that prevent the brain from receiving adequate oxygen can starve brain cells and lead to the symptoms of dementia.

Question: what is chlamydia?
Baseline Response: chlamydialystrophositis (Chlamydia trachomatis) is a bacterial infection caused by a bacterium called Chlamydia. Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease that affects more than 3 million people worldwide.
In most people, chlamydomyolysis (chlamydia infection) is caused by chlamysplastic filtration. This allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream and cause infection. The disease can be fatal if untreated.
What is chydomydiale?
Chlamydiosis is a condition where the chlamyl-clotting of bacteria can cause infection and/or death. It is caused when chlamiesplastic material is rubbed into the skin or the skin of a person with chlamelia. Chlorophyll bacteria may live in the skin, causing chlamia. Chylophos bacteria can also live in a

Question: can an antihistamine allergy pill be taken with high blood pressure medication?
Baseline Response: Yes, and you can take it with high-blood pressure medication. It's not a painkiller, but it's very effective.
It's also very effective for people who have a history of other allergic reactions.
I've never used an anti-histamine medication. I'm not sure if it's something that people want to take, or not, but I've never taken any antihistamines.
Do you recommend that people who are taking antihistaminants take antihistams?
It seems to be the case. I've heard from people who do not take anti-epilepsy medications. I think that's true.
If you're taking anti-hypertensive medications, do you recommend they be taken as well?
I don't think so. I don't know if it would be a good idea to take antihypertensives with anti-

Expected Response: most antihistamines are safe to use with medications for high blood pressure. but i would avoid the ones that also contain a decongestant as these may raise blood pressure. i would need to know which medications you take in order to provide a more precise answer. you should talk to your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medications especially if you have high blood pressure.
================================================================================
Question: is coffee healthy for kids? . how much is. to. . much?
Baseline Response: not much. It is safe to assume that the most important thing that a child can do to improve health is to eat a lot of food.
This is a good question. But I think it is more important to think about what happens when kids consume too much coffee. If you are looking at the question of whether or not coffee is good for children, you are going to have to consider the question "How much does a child need to eat to have a good health?" And if you are trying to determine whether or how much coffee is right for a child, you have to look at the data.
I have a question for you: can you imagine what you would eat if you were to consume all of the coffee you would have?
So, the answer is no. It does not. There is no real health benefit to coffee. It only benefits children. But there is

Expected Response: children rarely need the stimulant effects from coffee. i see nothing wrong with coffee being available in high schools to keep teenagers awake during afternoon math classes but i cannot see toddlers or younger children walking around with a cup of coffee. they don't need it and who really wants children to be more hyper? is it healthy for kids? probably not. caffeine zips them up and speeds up their little hearts. it is harmful? probably not but there have been little or no studies to back this up.

Question: i had a period apri 1-7 then another april17-21 and then off and on april 29-may 1. is it too eary to test i. i had a period apri 1-7 then another april17-21 and then off and on april 29-may 1. i am on norethindrone for birth conrol. i have taken like i am suppose to and if i am late taking it or miss it my husband and i don't do anything or we use condoms. i have not had a period yet and a little worried i might be pregnant. would it be too early to take a home pregnancy test?

Expected Response: hi you have just had 3 periods in 30 days so with that somehow i don't think you are pregnant. but if you want to test now would be the time to do it. hope this helps you and yours. good luck
================================================================================
Question: how do you control hypoglycemia when your trying to lose wieght?
Baseline Response: by trying to control it. I'm not saying you should try to control hypo hypoglycemic. I am saying that you can control it by changing the amount of food you eat and by increasing the amount you drink. If you try to get a little hypo, you will have trouble with your body. If your body is not functioning properly, then you will probably have trouble getting food.
How to Control Hypoglycemic Hypertension in Your Heart
If you are in an uncontrolled state, you are going to have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.
The only way you can prevent hypoglycosis is to get regular exercise.
What You Should Do
If your body becomes too stressed, then it will become more prone to hypoglycymia.
Take a few days to take care of your body and then get on with your life

Expected Response: the easiest way is too eat small amounts often. every few hours. a few slices of apple is enough to bring up your blood sugar and make sure your diet includes adequate protein divided up through the day as well.
================================================================================
Question: i've had chest/neck/back pain recently with bad headaches does this sound like stress or something more? . last night i had a lot of chest and back pain with no apparent cause. i have been having neck aches and headaches over the past week and i know it wasn't a panic attack (i've had them before). is this just stress related or should i be more concerned? about 2 months ago i got a new job which has been a stressful adjustment. i've also been very tired recently and it almost feels like my brain isn't working correctly. it's like i can feel something is missing mentally that used to be there.
Baseline Response: yes, it's a stress disorder, and it's not a panic disorder.
A panic attack is when a person experiences intense, uncontrollable, intense, intense pain. It's not an attack of panic, but rather a physical reaction to a situation. It can be as simple as a fever, or as complex

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're suffering like this. it's bad enough to take on a new job without then coming down with mysterious physical symptoms! unfortunately it's impossible to tell whether this is serious or not. obviously you should know the symptoms of a heart attack and also know the risk factors for heart disease. while anyone can have a heart attack it's more likely among people with multiple risk factors. i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to evaluate your symptoms. your provider probably will want to run some tests such as blood work or possibly and ekg. many medical conditions could cause the symptoms you describe including low thyroid. your health care provider can correlate your health history with your new symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis. i hope you feel better soon!
================================================================================
Question: i had anterior cervical discectomy & fusion 2 weeks ago now having severe pain between shoulder blades. normal? . had discs c4 and c5 c6-c7 removed. mesh was put around spinal column titanium plates and screws applied. i am now having severe pain between my shoulder blades. is this normal?
Baseline Response: i have posterior cervical discussure. and have a slight pain in my shoulder and my back. now is my back okay?

Expected Response: it's always concerning to have unexpected after-effects from surgery. the pain you're describing isn't unusual after an anterior cervical discectomy. the surgical positioning for that procedure can cause upper back muscle stiffness and soreness that lingers. in addition sometimes as the previously compressed spinal nerves come back to life they can cause tingling shooting or stabbing pain in areas where sensation previously was limited. all that said if your post-surgical pain is getting worse instead of better it's always a good idea to call your surgeon's office and speak to the nurse or physician assistant (pa). he or she can tell you what's expected in terms of pain and the general course of recovery. best of luck to you!
================================================================================
Question: 3 questions: does pheromone sprays work does ion/power bracelets work does penis enlargement pills/exercises work?
Baseline Response: 1.

Expected Response: no these are all basically worthless "quack" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain.
================================================================================
Question: i took my blood pressure meds this morning but it's still very high could i take a second pill
Baseline Response: i take my blood pressures meds every day
Answer 2: i have been taking blood pressure pills for about 2 months now. I have been using my bloodpressure meds for about 4 months now and i'm doing well.
Answer 3: i'm trying to get my blood Pressure meds to work but i'm still not feeling good.

Expected Response: i can't answer that. i don't know anything about you your blood pressure readings or even the type of blood pressure medication you are taking. dosage adjustments are best made by the medical provider who is treating you.
================================================================================
Question: can fibromyalgia cause profuse sweating?
Baseline Response: Yes, it can. The fibromyastin is a common inflammatory inflammatory factor that is commonly present in the body during sleep, and it is a major contributor to many chronic conditions. In fibromyalgic patients, there is little or no treatment for this condition. The typical treatment for fibromyacosis is a sedative, often used in conjunction with a massage, or a combination of both. If this is the case, it is likely that the patient will experience a small amount of sweating.
What are the symptoms of fibromyacia?
It is a mild to moderate sweating sensation.
It may appear to be a small, light-colored rash on the forehead, and may appear in the middle of the chest.
The rash is caused by the fibromyococcal conjugation of the fibroid tissue. The rash may be a large, red rash.
If the rash is large, the

Expected Response: sweating problems are common in fm because of the autonomic nerve dysfunction. the sweat glands receive nerve supply from specific autonomic nerves called sympathetic sudomotor nerves. sweating regulates our body temperature (called thermoregulation). in fm dysutonomia is present and causes too much sweating usually but sometimes the opposite occurs and our skin can be too dry. throw in the usual suspects that overstimulate our autonomics: weather changes heat sunlight certain meds esp ssri's & snri's position changes i. e. laying down stress exercise attempts etc. and we become bona fide sweating machines! treatments for excessive sweating are limited. i advise my patients to avoid aggravating factors if they can use antiperspirants not deodorants and sometimes an anti-cholinergic medicine can be tried. work with your doc.

================================================================================
Question: i have contact dermatitis. is there an over-the-counter ointment that i could buy to help heal this up?
Baseline Response: no. My dermatitis has not been resolved and i am not able to buy any ointments. However, there are many ointlements available to help with this.
I have contact skin and am able to find a topical ointmentation product that works. I have not been able to determine the exact dosage, but it works to help you.
If you are in a hurry, i would recommend that you go to a dermatologist and see if you can get a free consultation. If you are unsure about what a free ointlement is, see my article on free oints.
Do you know if there is an ointin in your skin that works?
Do your skin have ointins?
If so, how?
How do you know how to get your skin to work properly?

Expected Response: this is a popular question that i get at the pharmacy. typically the topical hydrocortisone products are very effective to use as long as the skin isn't broken or bleeding. if the itching is really bothersome an antihistamine like benadryl or zyrtec may be appropriate as well. be sure to have your medication list handy when you are talking to the pharmacist and let us know any other over-the-counter products you may have tried already too so we can help make the best decision.
================================================================================
Question: i have shingles and was with my daughter who just found out she is pregnant. is there a danger to the fetus
Baseline Response: There is. The unborn child is not a potential threat to the mother. The fetus is a potential victim of rape. It is not the baby's fault, as you might imagine, if he or she is raped. It's the mother's fault.
Answer 1: It is the mother that has the right to decide when the child is born.

Expected Response: from what i've learned in a short amount of time is that if you have shingles you are to stay away from pregnant women and people who have not had chicken pox.

Question: if my girlfriend has mrsa on (or in) her bartholin gland could i get it from us having sex? . hi there . my girlfriend said something about having mrsa on the glands in her vagina that make natural lubrication which i am assuming are the bartholin glands. my question for you is: if we have sex is it possible for me to contract it from her? this might be a silly question but i am actually kind of worried about it. thank you for the help!
Baseline Response: I've had a few people ask me if I could get a mrsb from them if I'm having a bad relationship. I've had many people ask about it and have been very, very happy with it. My girlfriend and I have had a lot of sex and I think she is just a good girl and she really enjoys it. I'm happy with my girlfriend having a mrb from her and would love to have her having a

Question: runny nose took antihistamine. developed fever. reaction to drug or cold/allergy symptom? . took over the counter diphenhydramine hci 25 mg. no fever prior to taking it but i had a bad runny nose.
Baseline Response: i tried to take the drug twice a week and only took it once a day. it worked for me. i thought i was going to be sick after taking the drug but after taking it i felt better.

Expected Response: benadryl (diphenhydramine) does not cause a fever nor is fever an adverse reaction to this antihistamine. allergies do not cause fever so any elevation in temperature that may have experienced is most likely do to your cold (assuming you have correctly diagnosed yourself). fever is the body's natural response to fighting off an infection.

Question: is it okay to finish a pack of birth control and stop cold turkey?

Question: are all-in-one shampoo and conditioners as healthy for my hair as washing with separate shampoos and conditioners?
Baseline Response: yes, the best shampoo and conditioning products can be found online at salon.com. However, there are a number of other products that can be used separately.
This is one of the most common questions about all-ins-one products. It is important to know the basics of all-solutions before you begin using all-purpose shampoo and Conditioner.

All-in One is the name given to all-out products that are designed to provide the best results for your hair. This includes all-natural products that include natural ingredients and ingredients that will improve your hair's appearance, and all-over products that will provide your hair with a clean finish.
All All-ins In One is a great way to get started. The product is designed to work in conjunction with other

Answer : you feel like you're on a computer.
When you feel a feeling, your body starts to release a hormone called testosterone.
If you have a feeling of high testosterone, you can be aroused by a strong orgasm.
But if you don't have high testosterone or if you're just starting out, then you may experience a sense of worry.

Question: can your lungs be ruptured if you cracked a rib?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 2: yes
Answer 3: yes (more...)
Answer 4: yes or more (more)
Answer 5: yes, yes, or more
Answer 6: yes(more...) (more...

Expected Response: well not exactly. the lung doesn't "rupture " exactly. it can collapse though. this is called " pneumothorax. " a broken rib can indeed puncture your lung. in fact it's not all that uncommon. if you watch any of those real-life trauma shows on television you will see emergency room personnel placing chest tubes in patients due to collapsed lungs and you can bet some of those collapses occurred due to fractured ribs. but if by "cracked" you mean "not completely fractured or displaced " then the answer probably is "no. " when a rub breaks and the two sides pull away from each other then one of them can puncture the lung. if a rib is "cracked" but the ends never comes apart then it's unlikely to penetrate the tissue surrounding the lung. on the other hand if you took a forceful blow to the chest that alone could cause a collapsed (not "ruptured") lung. so if you experienced chest trauma sufficient to crack a rib you certainly could experience a pneumothorax. surprisingly you can experience a collapsed lung without any known cause whatsoever. wishing you well!

Question: can rupturing a cyst under the skin cause cancer
Baseline Response: This is a tricky question. It is possible that rupture of a cyt could cause cancer, but not if the rupture is small. It could be that the cyst is too small to be of any concern, but if the cyt ruptures, it could be cancer. The size of the cysteine in the cytoplasm of the tissue is small, but it is not enough to cause cancer.
It is also possible that the rupture of the cell membrane of the breast tissue would cause cancer in the breast, but this is not the case. The cyst rupture is a type of cancer that can be prevented with surgery, which is known to prevent breast cancer. In the case of breast cancer, the cysts can become cancerous, and the cancer can be removed with surgery.
The size of a breast cyst may also be important. In some cases, a cytoprotection

Question: how can you cool down the main vein in a males testicle that gets too hot and causes infertility?
Baseline Response: this is where the "bipid" testicles get their hot and dry. When the male gets too much hot air, they can't get enough of it, so they end up with a male that is too hot.
If you have a female testicle, you can get a male with a hot testicle (that's what the bipid testicles are called). When this happens, the male will have a hot and humid testicle. The male will then have a cold and dry testicle which will be more than enough for him.
So if you want a male to be hot and cool, you need to do a couple things:
1. Add hot air to the male. This can be done by placing a thin layer of warm air on the male's penis or by placing warm air around his penis.
2. Place

A vaccine should only be given to those who are at risk for transmission to others.
If you are pregnant or have a child, you should not use the vaccine if you do not know what is

Expected Response: i was just diagnosed after being faithfully married for 10 yrs and only 1 other partner before him so i would like to know the answer to your question as well. i am sure you feel just as hopeless as i do and i still have so many unanswered questions it seems. <negative_smiley> life is so unfair.

Question: i lost 74 pounds and have wrinkled saggy skin. what natural product can i use for collagen and elastin production?
Baseline Response: i used a natural product called Tylenol which has been shown to stimulate collagen production and it has a good effect on the appearance of wrinkles.
If you are using this product, you should also use a natural moisturizer like hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer called Eucalyptus.
It also has a very good effect. I usually use this product when i am going to be washing my face, or in a different place, or I am going in a dark room.
I usually use a gel so that i can feel it's going to work.
And my skin is so soft and moisturizing.
i do not have any wrinkles, but i think it is very good.
Answer, i will use it once a month for 3 days and then i will apply a thin layer of moistur

Expected Response: tretinoin contains compounds that have been shown to increase cell turnover and collagen formation. unfortunately with severe weight loss there can be a loss of elasticity in your skin. therefore you may want to discuss these "problematic" areas with your dermatologist or a plastic surgeon.

Question: how can i stop my dog from chewing wood? . my st bernard keeps chewing the side of his dog house (made of wood) as well as almost anything made of wood . how can i stop that? is there a product i can put on the wood? . the side of the dog house (made of wood) is also painted.
Baseline Response: there is a product I can put in the wood. i just put the part of the wood in the paint and it will not do any harm.

Expected Response: i'm not a vet but i have 3 dogs and 3 cats so i'll weigh in based on personal experience. there are products that you can spray on wood that make it taste bad to dogs. it makes the wood taste very bitter. one product i can think of off the top of my head is called bitter apple. however if it's a large area that might not be possible. you could ask your local pet store what products they have to see if they have something that works for a larger area. i have had good luck with those products but the problem is you have to keep using them until your dog associates the bad taste with chewing the wood. then he may just turn to something else so ultimately it might be worth finding a professional that works with behavioral issues with dogs to get some pointers and try to get to the bottom of what might be causing him to chew.

Expected Response: there are a couple of possible explanations for this light spotting. the most common one would be light breakthrough bleeding due to the hormones in your birth control pill (bcp). with prolonged bcp use the lining of the uterus can become thinner. this can make it easier for spotting to occur. often such spotting will present after intercourse or even heavy exercise. typically it does not develop into a full on "period-like" bleed. other reasons for spotting after sex can include problems with the face of your cervix. for example if you have a new infection with chlamydia that can make the cervix friable (easier to bleed when touched by fingers penis etc). if you had a polyp in the cervical canal the polyp tissue is very fragile and bleeds easily. . my best guess is bcp caused spotting. if the spotting persists or you have risks for chlamydia (e. g. new partner or multiple partners) you should see your gyn of clinic for follow up. if the bcp is the culprit for the poor cycle control a change in bcp formula or brand can be helpful.

Question: what pulmonary rehab exercises can be beneficial to someone with copd?
Baseline Response: there are a number of different ways to do pulmonary rehab. These include:
The first is to use a pulmonary rehabilitation tool such as the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Technique (PPRT) or the Pulmic Rehabilitation Program (PPS). PPRT is a different way to do this than PPS, but it does work. PPRTs can be performed in many different ways. Some of the most common ones are:
PPR Tension (PTS) is a simple movement that involves the hand pressing the foot, while the other hand is pressing the other foot. The PTS is an exercise that can be done in a variety of different positions. You can also do the PPR in the middle of the leg. This is often done by using a pulley or a rope.
PPS (Posterior Pneumonadism) is an example of a PPR

Expected Response: the most important part of any pulmonary rehabilitation program for copd is exercise. all pulmonary rehab centers offer exercises to improve physical fitness. some pulmonary rehab centers provide an exercise program only. other centers provide access to specialists education and psychological support in addition to exercises. pulmonary rehab exercises include: lower-body exercises: most pulmonary rehab centers provide a regimen of exercises that centers on leg workouts. these exercises vary from simple walking on a treadmill or around a track to more intense stair climbing. most of the proven benefits of pulmonary rehab come from studies in people doing leg exercises. upper-body exercises: the muscles in the upper body are important for breathing as well as daily activities. arm and chest exercises might include turning a crank against resistance or simply repetitively lifting the arms against gravity. exercises for breathing muscles: breathing through a mouthpiece against resistance during pulmonary rehab may increase the strength of the breathing muscles. these exercises are infrequently used but may be helpful for people with very weak breathing muscles. strength training : most pulmonary rehab exercises concentrate on building endurance. adding strength training like lifting weights has been shown to increase muscle strength and bulk as well.

Question: what are some good romantic/love rock songs? . trigga trey x darrius millsz - where da opps at <link> <link> <link>
Baseline Response: what's a good romantic song?
A good romantic (or love song) is a song that sounds like a romantic song and is not only about love, but also about being alone. There are many great romantic songs that are not about love.
The romantic song is about the love of others. It is a love song about love and love that is meant to be sung. It's not about being loved by other people. It isn't about being lost or being lost in the world. It doesn't just mean being happy or having a happy life. It means being together with someone you love. It also means being with someone who you love, who you share your life with, who gives you a big hug, who is open to your needs and who doesn't give you the

Question: what causes eczema?
Baseline Response: eczemesis is the condition in which the symptoms are present (e.g., chest pain, cold, itching, and/or a burning sensation) and the underlying cause of the condition is unknown.
Solution: I suggest that you do a physical examination on your patient and ask him/her about the condition. Ask him/she to sit or stand for a few minutes and then, when asked to sit again, ask him or her to sit for a minute.
It's important to note that if you have an eczebic dermatitis, you may need to ask your doctor about a possible medical condition that may be causing your symptoms.
In the event that you're not able to see your patient, your doctor may ask you to wait until you're ready to treat your symptoms to get a diagnosis.
How do I get my symptoms back?
In order to get your symptoms back, you need to get

Expected Response: the exact cause of eczema is unknown but it's thought to be linked to an overactive response by the body's immune system to unknown triggers. in addition eczema is commonly found in families with a history of other allergies or asthma. some people may suffer "flare-ups" of the itchy rash in response to certain substances or conditions. for some coming into contact with rough or coarse materials may cause the skin to become itchy. for others feeling too hot or too cold exposure to certain household products like soap or detergent or coming into contact with animal dander may cause an outbreak. upper respiratory infections or colds may also be triggers. stress may cause the condition to worsen. the condition is not contagious and can't be spread from person to person.

Baseline Response: it's really hard to get my voice back to normal. I have been having trouble with this for a few months now, and i've been getting pretty sick and tired of hearing it all the time. I've tried to take my voice to another level by using my earphone and voice recorder, but I've only gotten better at it. My voice has been getting more and more loud, but i'm not sure if it's because i've stopped using my

Expected Response: unfortunately i have no way of seeing those "red stripes" over the internet to offer you a patient-specific answer. if you are concerned you will need to have a medical professional examine you first-hand. not something that i can accomplish in this forum. sore throat and ear pain are all reasons to seek medical care.

Question: what increases the risk of getting rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: there are many factors, including the type of child, the age of the child, and the location of the infant. If you are at risk for getting rh, you may need to consider a range of interventions. If the risk is high, it may be because you are allergic to the rhinoceros horn, or you have a history of rhinitis.
This is one of the most common types of rhs sensitization, with the highest rates of rhinephrine and corticosteroids (e.g., corticosterone). However, it is not always the case that the risk factors are the same. In fact, many factors may have different effects on the risk for rhinoconstriction (e

The risk of developing rhinoid sensitization is higher in people who are overweight and have lower levels of corticostriatal corticotropin (CRT)

Expected Response: rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. during pregnancy an rh-negative woman can become sensitized if she is carrying an rh-positive fetus. factors that increase the risk of blood mixing and sensitization during pregnancy include: 2 delivery. abdominal trauma such as from a car accident. abdominal surgery such as a cesarean section. placenta abruptio or placenta previa both of which can cause placental bleeding. external cephalic version for a breech fetus. obstetric procedures such as amniocentesis fetal blood sampling or chorionic villus sampling (cvs). miscarriage (spontaneous abortion ) ectopic pregnancy or elective abortion (medical or surgical abortion) after 8 weeks of fetal age (when fetal blood cell production begins). partial molar pregnancy involving fetal growth beyond 8 weeks. although rare rh sensitization has been known to occur after needle sharing between intravenous drug users. transfusing rh-positive blood in an rh-negative person can also trigger sensitization. but this is extremely rare because blood is always tested prior to transfusion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how to know when cats run fevers
Baseline Response: because they run
Question
Question 1: I was on my way home from work when I ran into a cat. I had heard about a cat that ran in a rush. I thought that the cat had run a bit too fast. But I didn't know what to do. So I decided to find out why cats run so fast.
Question 2: I'm trying to find a cat with a high-speed run. I can't find a good cat that runs fast. I've got to find the one that runs slower.
Answer
Question 3: I know there are many different ways to find cat's run. It depends on what cat is running fast. Can I find the cat that is running faster than me?
Question 4: If I have a cat running fast, I can tell what its name is.

Expected Response: hi if a cat temperature goes up by just 1 degree over its norm its not good for it they can get a bit robotic when walking. so with a thermometer do this. lubricate the bulb tip with a little petroleum jelly lift the base of the tail and gently slide it into your cat's rectum until half of it is inside. keep it in for three minutes withdraw and check the reading. you should seek veterinary attention if your cat's temperature is under 99°f (37. 2°c) or over 104°f (40°c). hope this helps you. good luck

Question: is malaria a particular problem for children?
Baseline Response: There are several different types of malaria, and each of them are different types.
The first type of malaria is caused by the malaria parasite, the diphtheria varroa (DVT). It is a parasitic infection that is spread by biting, licking, biting, and sucking blood. In this way it can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and death.
However, the second type of infection is caused primarily by the parasite, diphatitis varrosa (DVM). It affects the nervous system of people who are infected with malaria, or who have malaria.
In most cases, the parasite can only be found in the genital area of people with malaria. If you are infected and have symptoms of malaria such as fever, headache, sore throat, and a headache, you may want to avoid all mosquito bites.
How can I avoid mosquito bites?
When you get bitten by mosquitoes,

Expected Response: yes. all children including young infants living in or traveling to malaria risk areas should take antimalarial drugs (for example chloroquine and mefloquine [lariam]). although the recommendations for most antimalarial drugs are the same as for adults it is crucial to use the correct dosage for the child. the dosage of drug depends on the age and weight of the child. a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases is recommended for consultation in prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment of children. since an overdose of an antimalarial drug can be fatal all antimalarial (and all other) drugs should be stored in childproof containers well out of the child's reach.

Question: is zosyn the same as clindamycin? . 48 yr male severe tooth abcess. has heart disease.
Baseline Response: zosine is the same thing as zosylcin.
48 yr female severe tooth incontinence. has a heart attack.

Expected Response: no those are two different antibiotics. zosyn is a combination of two medications -- the antibiotic piperacillin and the medication tazobactam which helps the antibiotic work better and lessen the likelihood that the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic. clindamycin is a completely different antibiotic. zosyn is given in the vein whereas clindamycin can be taken as a pill (also can be given in the vein). both antibiotics could be helpful in treating a tooth abscess depending on the bacteria causing the abscess.

Question: why do new dads get depressed?
Baseline Response: because they're depressed.
You can't help it. I'm not a therapist.
I'm not an economist. I've never seen this. I mean, that's just what I do. I go on dates with my girlfriends. I don't like to get too much into it.
But it's just like any other relationship. I love you, I love your family, I'm the only one who can love you.

Expected Response: you’d think any new parent would be elated to hold a precious newborn in their arms. although guys can’t blame it on their hormones sleep deprivation has a major impact on someone’s view of life. spend two (or more) months with three-hour stretches of sleep and see how you feel! some dads also get stressed about 50/50 shared parenting responsibilities. (although they are happy to help many of them don’t have their own dads as role models. ) dads’ depression symptoms often go unnoticed. that’s because men don’t cry. depressed men may act angry withdrawn or even abusive. it’s important for friends family and health care providers to identify dads with postpartum depression and encourage them to seek help.

Question: how can i get rid of the nasty taste in my mouth from the inhaler?
Baseline Response: by taking a small amount of the food and drinking it with the rest of the diet.
The food will taste better if it is eaten with the food that is in the mouth and you can eat it with a spoon.
In the end, you will be able to eat the food with the mouth. It is a nice taste and the food is good to eat.
I think that it is possible to get rid from the taste of the foods in your mouth with a little bit of the money.
Thanks for reading this!

Expected Response: this is another great question and i can tell you that nine times out of ten when i have patients who come to me with this question it’s because they’re spraying it in their mouth and not inhaling it the way that they’re supposed to. i actually offer to retrain them on how they’re using their inhaler. if they do it the right way they should really not have any bad taste in their mouth. but they can rinse their mouth afterwards which is absolutely fine.

Question: can high blood pressure cause night sweats
Baseline Response: no, night sweats are caused by excessive sweating.
This is the most common cause of night sweats. The most common causes are:
1. Sore throat. This condition is caused by the fact that the skin is not dry enough to absorb moisture from the air, and therefore the skin gets too dry.
2. High blood pressure. This is caused when you feel the temperature of the blood drop below zero.
3. High cholesterol. This causes your blood sugar to rise, and that increases your risk of heart disease.
4. Over-excited. The more you exercise, the more you will get tired.
5. Hormonal imbalance. If you get too much insulin, you will feel more tired. If your blood pressure drops, you may need to take a blood thinner.
6. High triglycerides. This can cause your blood to become too high in triglycerides, which causes your body to

Question: how to get fluid behind the eardrum to drain. i have been to the doctors several times and on several antibiotics and i have no pain in my ear but i cant hear from the fluid built up. what can i do
Baseline Response: the earthen sound is what i hear when i sit in my car. the sound is just a sound coming from the earmark. it is very hard to hear. i cant even say how much this sounds like the sound of a car. i just heard the sound and i cant say how hard it is.
Answer to question #1: what is the best way to get the fluid from the Eardrum through the earthria?
Answer. The best way is to get it through the Earthria. i am not sure how to do this, but its easy to do. i would recommend this for people who do not have a lot of fluid in their ears.

Expected Response: there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion (fluid). 1. you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent. 2. decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc. have all been used with limited success. sometimes it helps. sometimes it doesn't. antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of "plumbing and ventilation" issue. not an infection. 3. an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid (tympanostomy) or suction and place tubes in your ears. i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum. i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside-down. with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i couldn't hear much through that ear. after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube. now apparently that tube isn't there to drain liquid or it would have done so already; i bet it's just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors. whatever. it's the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it's connection to the nose. i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped. that's the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way. apparently i didn't do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it'd get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside (where the ocean was). then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction. i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube. after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear. fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear. i caution you though about the decision to have "tubes" put in the ear drum to drain this fluid. i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out. i actually had the little tiny plastic rings. they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic. most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not. i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem. i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on. many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts e-coli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water. you do not want this to fester in your ear. depending on the type of tube used scar tissue can be left behind and ear drum will not heal on it's own. so you need another surgery to attempt to have the ear drum heal. the first attempt and it is beyond me why they even do this one the surgeon roughs up the ear drum and then places a thin patch of some kind of material over the hole(s) and hope this will work. this is only 60% effective. but it's your only option. i don't like the odds but that's all i was offered. i did not sneeze nor blow my nose for two months. and i was diligent in this i did not want another surgery i wanted this to work. it did not work at all. so now if i want to pursue it i have to submit to another surgery more anesthesia. risk. and the surgeon doesn't like this one because it's "very tiny surgery" is what i was told. they have to stitch the hole closed and i would imagine it's a big pain in the you know where. so don't just jump into this surgery. especially if you are not having pain. i would try more medications give it some more time try decongestants or antihistamines to dry out the ear(s). another go with antibiotics which i know is a real pain in and of itself. but don't just jump into surgery especially if you want to be able to swim this summer. pools are a better choice because the water is chlorinated but chlorine can damage as well. you will need ear plugs to swim but that's not a 100% guarantee that water will not get into the ear. i was told to use cotton balls covered in vaseline petroleum jelly when bathing or when swimming. this is disgusting and it does not come out of your ear. so you walk around with vaseline in your ears. really think about it. when i was a little girl i had swimmers ear; water behind the ear. i went to the doctor and he told me to drop alcohol in my ear until i heard it 'fill up'. you do this by tilting you head to the opposite side that has the water and slowly drop alcohol in the ear until you hear it 'fill up'. then press a kleenex or clean cloth against that ear to restrict the exit flow of alcohol and slowly tilt your head toward the side that has the water and slowly release the alcohol from the ear. you will hear it chug chugging as it exits and the last bit of flow should feel warm; that is the trapped water. i have used this technique for years when swimming or anytime i think i have water behind my ear. it works beautifully. i have had this for a month and apart from a nasal steroid spray the doctor says it will go on it's own accord. i have tried holding my nose and blowing hard into your cheeks but you just have to keep trying. try drinking laying down as well. it's a miserable complaint.

Question: i am almost two weeks late on my period it comes 1st of every month could i be pregnant. i am almost two weeks late on my period it comes the 1st of the month every month but last month i started 1-6 then stopped and lightly bleed 15-19. and i havent started this month i am trying to conceive. took two pregnancy home test and came back negative. should i take another one in a couple days or call the doctor .
Baseline Response: i have a few questions that i am not sure about but i think it would be better to ask it first before you decide to get pregnant.
Answer 1:
I am currently thinking about getting a hysterectomy and it would probably be best if i was not pregnant. I am still in my late teens and I don't have a baby yet but I am not really sure if i should get an abortion. I have never had a hysexectomy and I would definitely consider it.

Expected Response: your menstrual cycle could be affected by a number of things. are you under any new stress have you started a new exercise routine have you changed your diet? all those things can cause your period to become abnormal and even cause you to spot throughout the month. there is a chance that you could be pregnant. when i was pregnant with my first child i had a normal period for the first 5 months. i would take another test in a couple of days (remember first pee of the morning is always best) if that test comes back negative i wold recommend seeing your doctor. hope this is helpful.

Question: is counting calories really the trick to losing weight?
Baseline Response: The trick is to avoid fat.
The trick is not to lose weight because of calories. It's the trick.
So why do we use the same technique?
We use the trick because of a lot of different reasons.
First, the trick is simple. You don't have to be a calorie cutter to get your weight off.
Second, the technique is easy to follow. It takes only a few minutes to follow, and you'll be able to follow it every day for years.
Third, it's easy to know how to follow the trick correctly.
Fourth, it allows you to be confident in your weight loss and to get the most out of it.
It also allows you, as a person, to be more confident in the way you choose to use your body.
How do you get to the top of your weight? How do you gain weight without losing it?

Expected Response: healthy weight management is all about energy balance. that means burning more calories than you're consuming. so it is helpful to become familiar with the calorie counts of the foods you eat most often. keep a food diary for a couple of days and then look up the calorie counts of the foods you've eaten. you can get that information by referring to the nutrition facts panel on packaged foods or by looking online at websites like the usda national nutrient database. this will give you a sense of where your calories are coming from and help you identify some smart and easy ways to cut calories. for instance if you normally drink whole milk you can switch to fat-free milk and save 60 calories per cup. after a while you'll become a good diet detective and be able to estimate the calorie counts of your most regularly eaten foods. also remember that the higher the fat content the higher the caloric level. and of course the larger your portion the more calories you're consuming.

Question: my parents stay with me. my father has been unemployed since jan. 2013. . i have health insurance through my employer and it covers my wife. my parents are 62 and 57. can i include them in my health insurance coverage by applying on the website?
Baseline Response: My parents are in a family of three and my father is a U.S. citizen. I have no health insurance. I am on my own. My insurance company said that I should be able to stay on my parents' insurance but I did not. My parents have been unemployed for years and I have been able to pay for my own medical expenses.

My brother works as the home manager. My sister works as part time and my sister is a nurse. My father is retired and his wife is a nursing home manager at

Expected Response: you generally won't be able to add your parents to your employer insurance. employers have rules on who is considered a dependent and the affordable care act does not change those rules. your parents can apply for their own coverage through your state's marketplace and may qualify for a premium subsidy based on their income.

Question: my 2-yr-old son has a very red and swollen penis painful to touch. he peed without any complaints. what can this be? . he is not circumcised
Baseline Response: he is circumcised

Expected Response: i think you should get this looked at. whatever is causing the problem it's not normal. you may want to gently inspect the position of the foreskin. it should naturally cover the head of the penis (the glans). you should never pull the foreskin back on a boy younger than about age 5 not even to clean. at age 2 you can easily damage your son's penis by forcibly retracting (pulling back) the foreskin. at any rate a red swollen painful penis in a child is not something to take lightly. i'd suggest you put a call in to his pediatrician as soon as possible. best wishes to you both! your son has been jacking off to much tell him to stop or maybe he needs to have sex more you irresponsible parent.

Question: what is polymerase chain reaction?
Baseline Response: polymerase chains are enzymes that convert one molecule of protein into another molecule of RNA. The enzyme is a type of polymerase called a "polymerase chain" that is the type of enzyme that converts protein to RNA.
Polymerase chains convert RNA to RNA by polymerase reaction. The polymerase is a process called polymerase-coagulation that converts DNA to RNA and then polymerase reactions.
As a result of polymerases reactions, the DNA undergoes a polymerase process called "coagulated polymerase" which converts the DNA to a "protein". This process of coagulation is called polymerases reaction.
What is the difference between polymerase and coagulated reaction? Polymerase reaction is a reaction that takes place when the DNA is coagulating. In a coagulate reaction, the polymerase acts as a catalytic reaction in order to remove the enzyme.
The enzyme that

Expected Response: polymerase chain reaction is a method to analyze a short sequence of dna (or rna) even in samples containing only minute quantities of dna or rna. pcr is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of dna or rna. previously amplification of dna involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria and took weeks. but now with pcr done in test tubes it takes only a few hours. pcr is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the dna. moreover pcr uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying dna: two "primers" short single-stranded dna sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the dna stretch to be copied. an enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of dna reading its code and assembling a copy. a pile of dna building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy.

Question: what is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd)?
Baseline Response: I have been doing research into this for about a year and a half now. It is an interesting concept that has been around for quite some time. It was first proposed by a group of researchers in 2005. They decided to focus on an implant that could be used to train the patient to lift a heavy object. The idea is that when a patient lifts a heavy body, it will induce an immune response. It's not that it would be effective in training, but it could be a good tool in treating chronic pain. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that an implant can be used in a way that would be useful to patients who are suffering from chronic pain and who are not able to lift heavy objects. The results of the trial were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
I have a lot of experience with this kind of device. I had been using it

Expected Response: an icd is a sophisticated device used primarily to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation two life-threatening heart rhythms. the icd constantly monitors the heart rhythm. when it detects a very fast abnormal heart rhythm it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. there are several ways the icd can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. they include: anti-tachycardia pacing (atp). when the heart beats too fast a series of small electrical impulses may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. cardioversion. a low energy shock may be delivered at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm. defibrillation. when the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly a higher energy shock may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal rhythm. anti-bradycardia pacing. many icds provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.

Question: what are some effective relaxation exercises when you have breast cancer?
Baseline Response: In the case of breast cancer, breast cancer treatment is often very effective, and can be beneficial for a patient's recovery.
In addition to the many health benefits of breast treatment, there are some benefits that may not be obvious from the initial diagnosis.
The most important benefit is the reduction in the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
One of the most common problems with breast cancer is the formation of benign tumors. In the early stages of breast-cancer, the first signs of cancer occur.
After a few days, the benign tumors grow and spread into the breast. These benign tumors are called metastases.
At first, the cancer cells can't get inside the breast tissue. These tumors are usually benign. However, as the cancer cell grows, the tumor cells can grow into other tumors and become cancerous.
When the tumors grow, they become metastatic, causing the breast cancer to

Expected Response: here are some relaxation exercises to try: two-minute relaxation. switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. take a few deep breaths exhaling slowly. mentally scan your body. notice areas that feel tense or cramped. quickly loosen up these areas. let go of as much tension as you can. rotate your head in a smooth circular motion once or twice. (stop any movements that cause pain. ) roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. let all of your muscles completely relax. recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. take another deep breath and exhale slowly. you should feel relaxed. mind relaxation. close your eyes. breathe normally through your nose. as you exhale silently say to yourself the word "one " a short word such as "peaceful" or a short phrase such as "i feel quiet. " continue for 10 minutes. if your mind wanders gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. let your breathing become slow and steady. deep breathing relaxation. imagine a spot just below your navel. breathe into that spot and fill your abdomen with air. let the air fill you from the abdomen up then let it out like deflating a balloon. with every long slow breath out you should feel more relaxed.

2. In an environment where i was not using any medications that would be harmful to my body.
3. In my home, where i lived in a group setting, where my roommates and I lived together, where I would not have any other medications that could cause my body to react as expected.
4. In any other place where i would not be exposed to an overdose or drug that would result in me having an overdose that would potentially lead to a fatal overdose. This is not a hypothetical scenario.

================================================================================
Question: are men less prone to getting genital herpes than women and is it less severe than in women
Baseline Response: not as much as the answer. It is more like an average, but it is still not much, but the prevalence of genital herpes is higher in men than in the general population. This is probably due to the fact that women are more likely to have sex with men than with women. It seems that men are more prone to get genital herpes, which is a better predictor of whether or not they have a partner. This could be because they have more children, or because they are more inclined to have kids.

Source(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_are_more_prone_to_get_genital_hepatohem

Expected Response: both men and women can contract herpes equally. women do have a larger area of the type of mucoid tissue that may make their outbreaks seem worse but basically. herpes is herpes. it is bad for both partners and the first outbreak is always the worst.
================================================================================
Question: i had partial hysterectermy for prolapse uterus. i seem to be haveing same problem again. i am concerned and worried
Baseline Response: You must have an ulcer.
Answer #1: There is no ulcer in the uterus.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this issue especially during the holiday season! the problem here is that people use the term "partial hysterectomy " to mean different things. it can mean you had your uterus removed but not your cervix ovaries or other reproductive structures. the term "partial hysterectomy" also can be used to mean the uterus and cervix were removed but not the ovaries and fallopian tubes. because you had your uterus removed it is not possible for that organ to prolapse again. it is gone. i suppose it is possible for the cervix itself to prolapse (that is to hang down outside the vaginal opening) but this would be relatively uncommon. more common would be a possible prolapsed bladder. this can occur when the muscles that hold the urinary bladder in place become weak and the bladder collapses down into the vaginal wall. this certainly could feel the same as a prolapsed uterus and you may have symptoms such as pelvic pain difficulty urinating and tissue protruding from the vagina. i suggest you see your gynecologist or primary care provider to get this checked out. it's not a medical emergency but obviously you want to get an examination soon if only to make yourself feel better in finding out what the problem is. i wish you all the best.
================================================================================
Question: i am a college student and wonder what could be causing headaches during exercise?
Baseline Response: no

Expected Response: this could be a problem with your neck even something simple like a muscular strain in your neck can cause similar problems. there is also a type of headache triggered by exercise. for exercise induced headaches i usually recommend starting with aerobic exercise only for a very short time (just long enough to feel a very mild headache) every day and gradually increase the length of time you are exercising. if this doesn't really help you would need to see someone at your student health center (and they might need to refer you to a neurologist)
================================================================================
Question: what is the difference between percocet 5-325 and 10-325?
Baseline Response: Percocets 5-315 are the equivalent of 10-315. 10-305 is the equivalent to 10-355. 10/325 is equivalent to 1.5-1.75.
10/325 = 1.25-1/2.25
10-315 = 1/2/2
10=1/5.25 = 1
10>1=1.25


The difference is 1.75 = 1 percocc.

10 = 1-1 perc.


If you are a beginner, it is recommended to take 10-30 minutes to get into the sub. If you are in a team, try to get a 30-50 minute time to get in.




I have taken Percot 5-335 and PercOT 5-350.



Percot 2.5

Expected Response: the 10 -325 is twice narcotic the strength (the "325" is just the mg of acetaminophen which remain the same) than the 5 -325.
================================================================================
Question: are there any sleep aids that a pregnant woman can take?
Baseline Response: there are some sleep aids, including the Sleep Aid which helps you sleep, but there are other sleep aids which can help you feel your baby is sleeping and that you have to go to bed, or that your baby has been sleeping for the last few days.
I have a baby who is sleeping for about 15 minutes, but I have to stay in bed and wake him up every hour or so. I have a nightstand that I can use to get him to go through the day.
If I'm not going to go into bed and he's not asleep, he's going to be in bed. If he's asleep, I'll sleep with him in the same bed.
What about when he's up to his head?
What if he's over-sleeping?
Will he be able to go back to sleep?
Can he go to sleep on his own?
If he

Expected Response: unfortunately sleep aids are not recommended for use in pregnant women. there are some "best practices" that you may want to try such as creating a relaxing sleep environment (make sure your bed is comfortable keep your bedroom at a controlled temperature minimize light and noise and remove clocks so they cannot be seen from the bed) establish a regular sleep schedule (basically going to bed and waking up around the same time each day) avoiding naps during the day establishing a relaxing bedtime routine and avoid activities such as watching television in bed.

Baseline Response: what is the cause of your white blood cells?
Answer 1: the white blood can't keep up with the oxygen in your body.
Answer 2: it's the result of a faulty oxygen supply.
Solution: try this
Answer 3: try another, or try a different
Answer 4: try a whole new system
Answer 5: try to get a better understanding of how your white cells work
Answer 6: try your own system
Solution 7: try and get your own answers
Answer 8: try new ideas
Answer 9: try things that are new
Answer 10: try it all
Answer 11: try an old system

Expected Response: that is probably since no one knows what is going on at this point. an elevated white blood count can be caused by hundreds if not thousands of things. your doctor is trying to determine a cause by doing additional tests.

It is very important that I have a healthy relationship with my husband. We are both very happy with my life and we are doing well. We have always been married and have been together for many years.
I would like to ask you about your family.
We have been in a good relationship for many, many years and we have been very happy.
My husband has always been very supportive of me and always has been a supportive person.
He always is the one who gives me a lot of help.
When I was in my mid-30s, I was diagnosed with breast cancer

Expected Response: it is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. once you do get pregnant you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. before you start trying to get pregnant it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. sometimes medicines should be changed and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. each woman is different. so you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own. if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant: do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.
================================================================================
Question: what causes atopic dermatitis?
Baseline Response: As a result of an increase in the number of sunburns, and a decrease in the amount of sun exposure, atopic skin can become more sensitive to ultraviolet light. This is why sun exposure is considered a sign of the severity of the condition.
Solution: The sun is very bright, and the sun rays can easily penetrate the skin.
When sun exposure occurs, the skin is often exposed to ultraviolet rays, which can cause redness, irritation, and itching.
Sun exposure may also cause irritation of the eye, especially if the person has had sunburn.
The most common cause of redness is an increase of the amount or intensity of ultraviolet light, which is known as a corneal blemish.
This is caused by the fact that corneas have been exposed to UV light for thousands of years.
Because corneocytes are so sensitive to light, they have been found to be able

Expected Response: the cause of atopic dermatitis is poorly understood and is the subject of active research. research shows that it develops as a result of interaction between the environment your immune system and genetics (heredity). people with this condition seem to have very sensitive immune systems that are more prone to react to numerous irritants and allergens. most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergic conditions such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ). the skin inflammation that causes the atopic dermatitis rash is considered a type of allergic response. research has shown that even the unaffected skin of people with atopic dermatitis does not hold water as well as it should. 2 3 itching and rash can be triggered by a variety of factors including: exposure to allergens such as pollen animal dander or molds. dust mites may be an allergen although experts don't know whether they affect atopic dermatitis. exposure to irritants such as using soaps rubbing the skin and wearing wool. exposure to workplace irritants such as fumes and chemicals. climate factors especially winter weather and low humidity. cold air does not contain much moisture which can result in drier skin and increased itchiness. temperature changes. sudden changes in temperature can result in increased itchiness. a suddenly higher temperature may bring on sweating which can cause itching. lying under blankets entering a warm room or going from a warm shower into colder air can all promote itching. emotional stress. emotions such as frustration or embarrassment may lead to increased itchiness and scratching. exposure to certain foods typically eggs peanuts milk soy or wheat products. up to 40% of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis also have some type of food allergy. 4 but experts do not agree on whether foods can cause atopic dermatitis. excessive washing. repeated washing dries out the top layer of skin leading to drier skin and increased itchiness especially in the winter months when humidity is low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: is diarrhea a symptom of lung cancer?
Baseline Response: No, diarrhea is a symptom. The same is true of the other two types of cancers.
The most common form of lung disease is pneumonia. It is caused by an infection in the lungs. The person with pneumonia may have a sore throat, cough, or sore throat. The cause of the sore throat is not known. If the person has a sore mouth, the person may have pneumonia. The common symptom of pneumonia is the swelling of the mouth.

Question: how do i make a persistent dry cough go away for good? . it's been about two weeks now since i've had a cold/flu and i can't afford to go to a doctor right now. how can i treat this at home? or will i need to go see a doctor for this?
Baseline Response: I'm a long time patient of yours and you're a very good doctor. The dry cough is a very serious illness. The doctor is your best resource and will do what he can to help you. If you're not sure what you need to do, you can always ask for an appointment at your local hospital.
The first thing you need is a prescription for a cough medication. I recommend the same thing for cold and flu. I can't wait to see your doctor because the cough medication will help you get better.
You need to have a cough medicine, which is usually a prescription that you have to get from your doctor. It is an inexpensive

Expected Response: most helpful answer you are coughing for a reason. coughing helps clear your airway of mucous so if you are still coughing then perhaps you are still having post-nasal drainage. coughing can irritate the respiratory track so the more that you cough the more that you may feel the need to cough. assuming that you are not having signs of a secondary infection like pneumonia (fever chills rapid respiration) or an asthma-reaction (wheezing shortness of breath etc. ) you can quiet an annoying cold-related cough several ways: hydrate: drink plenty of fluids humidify: use a cool mist humidifer or at least take a steamy shower before bedtime soothe: try some honey to coat your throat suppress: you can take an over-the-counter cough suppressant that contains dextramethorophan (dm). a pharmacist can help you select a good one. try some cough drops. many contain soothing glycerine to help the irritated throat. don't leave them in your mouth at bedtime however! control post-nasal drainage. an antihistamine may help dry up a drip. avoid decongestants at bedtime (they increase post-nasal drainage) any persistent cough should be taken seriously so you may need to see a medical professional if the cough does not quiet down and completely resolve.

Question: to dr. moser i hope you read this. thank you for answering my question. some more information would be appreciated. it was a staph infection that was in his testicle area. i know the needle would've hurt. but should he have felt much more after that. it was a min or less that the dr. waited before he started to lance the infected area. it was a very small incision that he made. no bigger than the tip of a pen
Baseline Response: to Dr. Moser i would like to thank you, for your kind and compassionate response. Dr. Moses is a pediatrician at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of The Newborn Infant Syndrome and the Birth of a Newborn. Dr Moser has published several articles in the Journal of Birth and Development. He is the author and co-author of "The Birth of the Newborn and the Baby's First Born" (2011) and "The New

Expected Response: most helpful answer a staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced. i have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as i am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved. just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use. many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them. in order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected in the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus. this can be very difficult. sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is less painful that trying to numb up this challenging area. hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now. if the staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again.

Question: am i more vulnerable to "catching" a cancer if i currently have the flu.
Baseline Response: the flu can make you sick. It's not that bad, but I don't know if the flu helps you or not.


"What is a cancer? I don´t know, but it is a virus."

The flu can cause cancer.

(The flu doesn´t cause cancer, but rather, it is caused by a virus.
. It is a disease. You can kill a cancer by getting rid of it.
: It is not that good.



I have a question about "catching a cancer". I was diagnosed with a cancer in my left arm and am now on the verge of getting a new one. I have to start over. My doctors told me that they could treat me with chemotherapy but that it is not possible to treat a cancer without chemotherapy. I am in a very difficult situation, I am at the

Question: how can a complex cyst on the thyroid be diagnosed as benign just by ultra sound? . how can a complex cyst on the tyroid be diagnosed as benign by a ultra sound?
Baseline Response: the thyroid is not a brain tumor. It is a tissue that is located in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is the brain's central nervous system. The body produces hormones called hormones to control the body's metabolism and function. The hormone system is responsible for making the body more energetic. The adrenal gland produces the thyroid hormone, which helps regulate the body. The gland also produces the hormone cortisol, which is a hormone that helps control the hormones that make up the body and make sure that the body is being maintained and healthy.
If a cyst is benign, it is a benign cyst. A benign cyste is a cystic tumor on the top of the thyroid. The tumor is located on the base of the gland and is located deep in the central nervous and

Question: is there a test to tell if mono is gone? . my son is 17 and has mono. he was sick for a couple of week before it was determined that he had mono. no it has been 4 weeks and he is feeling great. is there a way to tell if he still has mono or can he go back to full daily activities.
Baseline Response: I'm sure there are many ways to test if a person is still alive and healthy, but this one is a little more complicated.
My son is currently in a coma and my son has been living with a friend. My husband and I have been together for 12 years and have been friends since we were kids. He has been with my wife for about 7 years and he has been very supportive. He is very active and I am very grateful for him.
I have been very fortunate to have him in a very loving and supportive relationship. He will be able to continue to have normal life. I'm sure

Expected Response: that will be up to his medical provider to decide. while there are blood tests (ebv panel and liver function tests) that can determine the current status of this pesky viral infection a hands-on examination may be necessary to know if he is now good-to-go. since some "daily activities" may include contact or collision sports (like football) it is best to get the patient-specific okay from his doctor or health care professional. the fact that he is feeling great is the best news of course so the mono may have completely resolved by this four week mark.

Question: vaseline safe for anal sex. is vaseline safe for anal sex? if not then what is safe to use? also should my partner wear a condom? is do what kind and brand? thank you.
Baseline Response: no. if you use a condom and you don't want your partner to get pregnant then you can use a vaseline injection.
This is the most common way to get vaseline from a pill, it is a vasilical injection and it is the safest way to use it. There are a few different types of vasilicals and they are all very different.
The main difference between vasilics and vases is the amount of time you have to take them to release the vaseline. The more time you take, the more vaseline will be released. It is much more common to take one type of vaseline than another.
If your partner is having a vasectomy or a vasectomies then you will need to wait a

If you want to use this, then you will need to do the following:
1) wash the vagina
2) apply the soap to the clitoris (the part of the vagina that is most affected by the soap)
3) apply it directly to the genital area of the woman and then apply it in her vagina to remove any unwanted bacteria
4) apply a white liquid to the area of her clitoris and then wash it
5) apply soap to this area
6) remove the soap and continue to apply the white liquid
7) apply white liquid in a manner that removes the excess soap
8) apply an adhesive to the areas where the white gel is applied
9) apply this white liquid over the area where the soap was

Expected Response: any soap that you use for your face you can use for your genital area. rinsing with fresh water is always advised. the vagina has a natural lubricant so it should not be the soap that is responsible for any dryness. check with your medical provider if this is an ongoing issue.

Question: how can i tell if i’m sleep deprived?
Baseline Response: you can't tell if you're sleeping or not. I know this is a tough question, but if you have insomnia and your computer crashes and you need to call your doctor, they can help you.
If you have any questions about this question, you can email me at: hutchinson@gmail.com or call 1-855-638-4488.
I am the CEO of a local hospital. I have an active and well-liked family. I am not a doctor, but I have been diagnosed with insomnia and I am concerned about my health. I don't sleep well and it is not a problem. I want to help you and if you need help, please call 1.855-644-4483 or 1-877-634-2785.

Expected Response: if you fall asleep before your head hits the pillow that’s not a good sign. that means you’re sleep deprived okay. if you fall asleep in less than 5 minutes on a regular basis you probably need more sleep. if you fall asleep while driving that’s a big danger zone factor a big red flag that you’re going to want to understand a little bit more about. driving a car and operating a vehicle and while it may seem very rote and may seem very easy to do if you notice yourself moving over lanes not being able to stay in the lane as you normally would that’s going to be a definite sign of sleep deprivation. if you’re not thinking as clearly you’re not making the decisions that you would normally make as quickly that’s going to be a sign of sleep deprivation. and just overall movement your reaction time slows down with sleep deprivation your cognition time slows down. believe it or not even your creativity slows down with sleep deprivation. so if you’re at work and you’re trying to answer to a big problem or trying to understand what’s going on and you’re just not clicking you’re not finding the words you’re not doing the right thing or what you would normally do it could be a sign of sleep deprivation.

Expected Response: i'm not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this? my friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds. i was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight. the first thing i did was not allow her to make her own plate. she thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate. a sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein (1 sausage) and a glass of orange juice. or since you're young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal that's healthy and without all that sugar. an ex could be kashi or something like raisin bran. the second thing i did was teach her about nutrition. her mom is 300+ pounds so i knew there was no one there who knew either. if you ball your hand into a fist that's the size of your stomach. that's how much food can actually fit. anymore than that then you're stretching your stomach out. the more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size it's supposed to be. third which should probably be first but i wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise. you have to exercise. skipping at school or pe isn't enough. i walked with her everyday for 30 minutes. she didn't think she could do it but i stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her. we were even able to start doing it twice a day. hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging. fourth you have to drink tons of water. sometimes your body might feel like it's hungry when you're actually thirsty. a good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day. to help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cups/glasses and that's how you can keep track. fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods. i made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal. her snacks were fruit. also a good time to say eat 5-7 small meals everyday and when i say small i mean the size of your fist small.

Answer to

Expected Response: no it is not normal to have pain with vaginal sex especially three years after a c-section. i would strongly suggest that you see your gynecologist so that you can be properly examined to determine why this is happening. hi as you have not said have you changed partners since your c-section and is your new partner on the larger size penis wise or has your partner been doing some pe exercises so he now has a longer and larger penis apart from that cant think why this is happening. so suggest just get off to your gyno let him do some tests. do hope this helps. good luck

Baseline Response: what is it that keeps you from healing?
Answer, you should start taking a daily dose of the antihistamines (TicTac) for at least one week, with or without taking a regular pill.
you should take the TicTacs every day

Expected Response: there is no way to calculate an individual's hiv risk from just one encounter but you did have some very risky sex. unprotected open wound on penis bleeding female partner and someone who's sexual history is unknown. i would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and have std testing especially for hiv.

Baseline Response: no, there is no medical condition that would cause this.


It is possible that an overactive thyroid may cause symptoms which are not indicative of a hypothyroidism. This is the reason why people should stop smoking and start using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the first time.

Question: my girlfriend has genital herpes but i love her to pieces for who she is. should i stop dating her because of this? . my girlfriend of 2 months recently told me that she has genital herpes. i didn't react badly i tried to support her and tell her that i won't cut her out of my life because of it however i'm stuck on what i should now do. i love her to pieces for who she is not what she has. i want to be able to be with her but i've been worrying a lot about how much we can do with one another before risk of catching it comes in. i have no intentions of catching it but i have every intention being with her.
Baseline Response: no, i have herpes and i have always wanted to be close to her. i don't know why she's so upset at me. but i want her to know that I love her and that she will always be with me. i am not going to cut off her

Expected Response: i wouldn't ask the general public for an opinion on this matter but there are two paths: 1. stay with her in aspiration you become married in which then you would be susceptible to herpes and have the risk your child may become infected. 2. leave and play life a couple more rounds. in my personal opinion it seems pretty obvious for the second option but it is your choice.

Question: i am almost eight months pregnant with my first child. is there anything i can take or do to reduce my back pain?
Baseline Response: It depends. My doctor said that i have a pain in my back that has increased significantly in the last year or two. So I've had to take some extra medication to help my back ache. I'm trying to get back to having a normal pregnancy and getting back to normal weight. I've also been working hard to improve my blood pressure.
Now, i'm a huge fan of the internet and my blog. My husband has been telling me about how he's been able to get through his first pregnancy and how much he loves his husband. He's also been really supportive and has been doing a lot of things for me. I have a lot to learn from my husband. I don't know how to go about getting back into my normal routine.
I'm also working hard on getting back on track to be able to have

Expected Response: the real question is what type of back pain are you having? is it constant or intermittent? if it comes and goes you may be having contractions and should contact your physician. if it is constant then it most likely is related to nerve impingement related to the pregnancy. exercise is a very good idea. you may want to take a warm bath keeping the water temperature less than 104 degrees preferably around 100. this may be relieving. depending on what the pain is your physician can possibly provide you with ideas on how to better handle the problem. there are different exercises alternative type of therapies and there are safe medications that can be used to help as well.

Question: why does coffee give me such an energy boost?
Baseline Response: because it gives me a boost in my energy level.
You can read more about how coffee affects your body in this article, but for the time being, I'm going to focus on the effects of coffee on your body.
It's important to note that a good coffee drink doesn't have to be a cup of coffee or a bottle of water. The caffeine and alcohol content is just a matter of taste and volume.
A good coffee will have a very similar caffeine content to your favorite drink. So if you like a bit of coffee, you should be able to get a little bit of it from a bottle.
The problem with this is that you can't get the right amount of caffeine or alcohol in a cup.
So if you're going to drink a cup, you have to make sure that you have enough caffeine or Alcohol in your system to keep your body going.
One of the best

Expected Response: as you're drinking your morning cup of joe you're probably just waiting for that wonderful rush of energy and alertness you've come to know and enjoy. within 15 minutes of gulping your caffeine your adrenalin rises increasing your heart and breathing rates your stomach starts to produce more acids and your urinary output rises (as anyone with a small bladder knows! ). but i bet you didn't know that caffeine tweeks your adrenal glands to produce more cortisol (stress hormone) which then stimulates the release of the liver's stored sugars. any endurance athlete knows this and uses it to their advantage. you drink your caffeine and then use the newly circulating sugar fuel to power through another workout. but what if you're sitting at your desk sipping your coffee with nowhere to go? then you might have problems because when the sugar levels rise with caffeine so do insulin levels which when they finally plummet after handling the circulating sugar leave a rip roaring appetite for more sugar in their wake. for runners and bikers this makes sense since you've just burned a zillion calories and need to replenish the sugar stores. not so for someone in an office cubicle with nowhere to go. here are some suggestions. to kill carb cravings associated with caffeine ingestion make certain to eat a combo of protein and fiber. how about peanut or almond butter on a multigrain cracker? or have that caffeine with a yogurt and blueberries or eggs and veggies. you get the point. when you're downing lots of coffee with nothing in your stomach you're more likely to reach for sugary foods so watch out. or you can just drink beverages with less caffeine in them: 6 ounces brewed coffee 105 mg caffeine; 6 ounces instant coffee 55 mg; 12 ounces colas 35-45 mg; 6 ounces tea 35 mg. now remember when you go to one of your fancy schmancy coffee houses you'll often be purchasing at least 8 ounces of coffee and closer to 12 ounces so you're really consuming over 200 mg of caffeine. all the more reason to be cautious if you just happen to be one of those people who is affected by the sugar rush.

Question: what's the difference between "situational depression" and depression that's not situational?
Baseline Response: there's an important difference between them, which is the difference in the way that you're able to cope with the stresses and the stressors that you have to deal with. When you're in a relationship, it's like you're dealing with a very high level of stress and that's the kind of stress that's going to be out there. When I was in a crisis, I would just go to work, I'd go to school, I went to school to go to college, I'm in a stressful situation. And when you're stressed, you're going to do things that are not going to work.
The stress that you've been in a situation for so long will change your life, and you'll find that you can do things differently, but you're not going back to your normal life, which has been a great experience for me.
It's

Expected Response: depression is depression defined by a series of symptoms that involve changes in sleep energy concentration appetite etc. one does not need to have a reason to develop a depression though if there is a particular event that may have precipitated it (e. g. a loss a separation) that may be relevant to the psychotherapy and understanding one's vulnerabilities to depression. not everybody who has a loss or stressful event occur develops a depression so the thinking is that someone either is or isn't biologically vulnerable to developing depression. depression is different from normal grief or sadness. grief or sadness related to an event does not involve disruptions of sleep and appetite or thoughts of suicide. in fact normal grief can become complicated by a depression which in turn can interfere with the resolution of the grief; so in other words depression is a syndrome involving many components and whatever causes it (we don't really know) it should get treated. when the syndrome involves strong physical symptoms (sleep energy concentration not functioning thoughts of suicide) medicines are especially likely to be helpful.

Question: my implanon is expired by 3 months having irregular bleeding and sore breast. can i become pregnant if its expired? . i have had my implanon in for 3 years (sept. 26th it was placed). i have not been able to get it removed but my insurance kicks in the first of the year. i have had sore breast some nausea and i've had my period 3 times in less then 2 months. they have not been regular ones tho. i have taken a pregnancy test but was negative. is there a good chance of getting pregnant while the implanon is still in place but passed the 3 year mark?
Baseline Response: I am currently on a 3 year period and have a new pregnancy test that shows it has passed the 2 year mark. i am not sure if my pregnancy test was tested or not but i'm pretty sure it was tested. i did take a pregnancy exam but i did not know if my test was done or not. i would have thought

Expected Response: yes you can get pregnant. that is why the implanon has an expiration date. the point where the hormone has depleted. this may be why your period is not normal. use a secondary form of birth control (like a condom) or you will be just taking chances.

Question: i am employed full time and contribute toward my health care insurance. . what will be the incentive for employers already providing very good health care coverage to maintain the plans they have? it seems to me that this opens that door for everyone to have access to coverage whether they go to work every day or not but for those who do get out of bed every day to go to work (and have had good insurance coverage until now) will most likely get their plans downgraded to be more in line with what everyone will qualify for. what will be my incentive to keep working when my unemployed neighbor gets the same insurance i do for staying home?
Baseline Response: It will be more expensive for me to keep going to work than if I were to stay home and get a good job. I will probably be able to pay for the cost of the health care I have and get coverage for my family, but I will not have the same benefits as if I was to stay at home and have to rely

Expected Response: employers have plenty of incentive to offer health insurance. for one it's a very important tool for attracting top-notch employees a fact the law isn't likely to change. second employers reap significant tax benefits by offering employees health insurance. in addition the health reform law requires employers to continue offering coverage or pay fines for failing to do so. and any changes employers make to their plans will have more to do with controlling costs than anything else -- a trend that's been in place long before the affordable care act became law.

Expected Response: although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. a moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men (under 65 years old) and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old. a serving is considered: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits so the answer to your question depends on if you’re male or female how old you are and whether you’re having an appropriate serving size. if you’re already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isn’t to suggest that you start drinking if you don’t already. the potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too. this would be an area to discuss further with your doctor. drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems. keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension. it’s typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you don’t already and it’s important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol.

Question: how can i convince a reluctant child to get a flu shot?
Baseline Response: It depends on what type of flu shot you are taking. If you have a flu vaccine, you should be able to get the flu shot without any discomfort. If not, you can try other flu vaccines. If your child has any allergies to the flu vaccine you can get it without any pain. If the flu does not work for you, you will need to get your child vaccinated. You can also get a free flu shot at your local pharmacy.
How do I get flu shots?
There are two ways to get flu shot. The first is to buy the flu shots through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). You can find the CDC's website at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccines.
The second way to get vaccinated is through the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The NICE website can be found

Expected Response: why [not] flumist? it is an equally effective (some studies say "more effective") flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose. no needles. when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things: 1. i give them choices. they can have one shot (assuming they only need one) or two! 2. i can give them a "booster" instead of a shot. (it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful! ) 3. they can get it in their arm or leg where it doesn't hurt very much or their eye! (of course we don't do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice. 4. i tell them this: "i am not supposed to do this but if you don't tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle. the one we use for infants instead of the big-person needle. how about that? " 5. and finally. "if this little "booster" hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately! " (of course she is going to do that anyway. ) the games we play.

Question: what does ventral fat hernias and enlarged spleen have to do with drinking a few alcoholica drinks. ive never heard of su
Baseline Response: It is possible that they have to be a result of drinking alcohol and that they are the result of an enlarged spasm. ives never heard about this but they are a result from the fact that the spleen is larger. The spleen has a large volume that it needs to maintain. ivit
Answer that if you drink more than a few drinks a day, the spasm will be less. ix
Answer. It is a possible that the amount of alcohol in your diet is causing the spasms and that you need to increase your intake of alcohol. if you are at a high calorie deficit then the spasms should be small and this will decrease your intake. y
Answer, this is a common situation, but it is not a problem. 
Answer I am not aware of

Expected Response: this all depends or what you call a few drinks and just how often?

Question: how can an antihistamine cause hives? . when i take zertech i break out in hives from head to toe?
Baseline Response: it doesnt work that way.
The only way to make a hives is to get a lot of it to the surface of the hives, so that you dont get the hive stuck in the ground or even in your skin. If you dont have a lot, you will not get a good hives.

Question: is there something otc for low testosterone?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure what to make of this. I think this is an interesting question. I don't think that the answer is the same as "what do you think about low testosterone?" I think it is that there are some people who don't know what to do with their testosterone levels. They are just looking for a way to stop having testosterone and start getting it back.
I think that if you are going to get low testosterone you need to get it back, and that is what you need. You can't get it to go back to normal. You need to be aware that you are not going to be able to get the same amount of testosterone as you used to. I would say that if your testosterone level goes down, then you need a lot of other things to take into account. I have seen people who have low testosterone who have had a stroke or who have suffered from some form of heart disease

Expected Response: no. there is not. if someone needs testosterone replacement for low levels only the prescription versions have been proven to be safe and effective.

Baseline Response: Tb or parasite infection is not a cause for this condition. Tb is a symptom caused by a parasite, which is a parasite which is an infectious virus that causes infections in humans. Tt is a viral infection that can be transmitted by saliva, saliva, feces, or other bodily fluids. tt is not contagious but it can spread to others. tb is not transmitted by any other means

Answer,
I'm in the middle of my first major blood clot and i need to check my blood glucose. my doctor tells me to take one more dose of insulin and one more pill every other day. i start taking insulin when i'm about 20 minutes late. my insulin level goes down and i get really sleepy. my body is not responding as well. i am about to have a seizure. my doctors tell me to stop taking the medication and I'm told i'm not taking the medicine and i

Expected Response: keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day. exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards. stress can influence blood pressure too. in fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldn’t be elevated otherwise. make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible. for these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people. also because your blood pressure can vary it’s important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern. the best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel. the accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device. some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too. to determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device. it is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day. the most important reading would then be the average reading so just take your bp a few times a day and write it down. as long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important. my moms blood pressure is 56 over 40 what

Question: what are the symptoms of crohn's disease?
Baseline Response: Crohn's is a chronic condition in which the immune system is unable to fight off the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The symptoms of Crohn' disease include a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The disease may then develop in the person and is often referred to as "crack." Crohn is a common and difficult disease to treat, so it is important that you learn to treat it with the right medications.
What are the signs of Crohns Disease?
Crohn's Disease (also known as Crohn ulcer disease or Crohn disease ulcer) is a condition in the bowel that causes inflammation of the bowel and affects the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even death.
Crohns disease is a disease of the rectum. It is caused by a bacterial infection in the rectus abdominis, which is the

Expected Response: common symptoms of crohn's disease include abdominal pain diarrhea and weight loss. less common symptoms include poor appetite fever night sweats rectal pain and rectal bleeding. the symptoms of crohn's disease are dependent on the location the extent and the severity of the inflammation. the different subtypes of crohn's disease and their symptoms are: crohn's colitis is inflammation that is confined to the colon. abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are the common symptoms. anal fistulae and peri-rectal abscesses also can occur. crohn's enteritis refers to inflammation confined to the small intestine (the first part called the jejunum or the second part called the ileum). involvement of the ileum alone is referred to as crohn's ileitis. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. obstruction of the small intestine also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis is inflammation that affects only the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum) the part of the small intestine closest to the colon. abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's enterocolitis and ileocolitis are terms to describe inflammation that involve both the small intestine and the colon. bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain are the common symptoms. small intestinal obstruction also can occur. crohn's terminal ileitis and ileo-colitis are the most common types of crohn's disease. (ulcerative colitis frequently involves only the rectum or rectum and sigmoid colon at the distal end of the colon. these are called ulcerative proctitis and procto-sigmoiditis respectively). up to one-third of patients with crohn's disease may have one or more of the following conditions involving the anal area: swelling of the tissue of the anal sphincter the muscle at the end of the colon that controls defecation. development of ulcers and fissures (long ulcers) within the anal sphincter. these ulcers and fissures can cause bleeding and pain with defecation. development of anal fistulae (abnormal tunnels) between the anus or rectum and the skin surrounding the anus). mucous and pus may drain from the openings of the fistulae on the skin. development of perirectal abscesses (collections of pus in the anal and rectal area). perirectal abscesses can cause fever pain and tenderness around the anus.

Question: how do i know when a burn is serious enough to see a dermatologist?
Baseline Response: it's pretty simple. I have no idea.
I started doing this last summer, but I didn't see any results. So I decided to look into it myself.
First, I went to dermatologist.
He said that the only reason for that is that the skin doesn't heal properly. He said that you can't expect the skin to heal when it's just a few weeks old, but that's not the case.
So I went out and saw a dermatology doctor, but he said that he had no way to tell you what's wrong with your skin.
The dermatologist said that it's not as bad as I thought it was, and that it was a minor problem. I went into a dermatological hospital, and I took a couple of days off.
Then, the doctor came back and said that there is no reason to have a skin

Expected Response: if the burn covers over 10% of your body surface area or is blistering you should see a dermatologist or go to the emergency room immediately.

Baseline Response: when are you going to be able to return to your normal routine and be able, again, to run/jog again?
Answer - 1/1/2018 -
Answer : you can return to working in the ER with a cyst. no pain, no pain. the pain is not so bad it is not a problem. the patient is happy and there are no complications. the surgery is good and no pain or any of the side effects is present. i had the cyst last week. there are only 4 of the 4 and they are fine.
If you are going to do

Expected Response: you will need to be specifically cleared by the medical provider who is treating you -- the one familar with the details of your case. healing time varies from person to person so there is really no set rules for when to return to strenous activities.

Question: had unprotected sex about 2 weeks ago. i'm on birth control. can i be pregnant? . been on bc for about 4 months and now i'm on placebo week. if i don't get my period during this time would i be pregnant? i haven't had any symptoms of pregnancy whatsoever. i mean i don't think i have?
Baseline Response: no. i think i just have an issue with my period. i don't think i should go into the hospital or anything like that. so i just need to have a baby.
Answer
Answer : no.

Expected Response: birth control pills are highly effective in preventing pregnancy so your chances are small. i would advise against unprotected sex in the future however since condoms will add one additional layer of pregnancy protection and excellent protection against sexually-transmitted diseases

Question: how is having a $3000 health care deductible better? . since the aca i now have a $3000 deductible for medical care and $1500 deductible for prescriptions. in effect i pay $200 a month for insurance that does not pay for anything. i will not meet those deductibles within 12 months unless something catastrophic happens (and i cant afford that). i fail to see how this is improving health care in america. all it has done is ensure people go to the doctor less frequently even if they need care and and that they don't get the medications they need.
Baseline Response: Answer 1:
The problem is that the people who are being pushed into the coverage gap by the ACA are doing so for the same reasons they are being forced into the health care system.
The ACA created a system that does nothing to help people with high deductible health care. It allows them to get the same insurance coverage as they would in their own state.
In fact, the ACA

Expected Response: many people have expressed frustration as you have about the cost of health insurance -- in particular the out-of-pocket costs that come with many health plans. insurers are now required to accept everyone who applies (before the law they frequently refused to sell coverage to people with any type of pre-existing medical condition). in response they have looked for other ways to reduce costs. shifting costs of care to consumers is one way to do that. the plans do provide access to many preventive services without you having to pay anything at the time of the visit. so it's important to take advantage of that -- wellness visits vaccinations many cancer screenings etc. depending on your health condition you may able to get most of the care you need each year at no additional cost. and you mentioned a catastrophic situation which is what insurance is intended to protect against in the first place. under the law your costs are capped at $6 600 for 2015. that's a lot of money but if you were in an accident or got very sick it's a lot lower than it would be if you had no coverage or even a private insurance policy before the law took effect. still i understand your frustration. no doubt there are trade offs. everyone is now guaranteed coverage but healthcare remains very pricey for most people. you might want to revisit the marketplace during open enrollment -- november 15 - february 15 -- to see if you can find yourself a better deal.

Question: my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.
Baseline Response: she is not sick at all. she has been doing well and she is fine. she can be a little more active if she has a little rest and maybe a little less. she is still getting more and more diarrhea.
What is your opinion about

Expected Response: first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book.

Answer- it was just me and my doctor and i were just having a hangover and i had no idea what to do. i did try to take a cab and a doctor told me

Expected Response: what are your symptoms? i have been bloated and burping for two months. i am nauseous too though. my sister and i are looking into our hormone levels. we found that melatonin is a hormone in your body and changes all the time like insulin levels. in the winter with lack of sunlight melatonin levels can be high and stay in the gut creating high acid levels in the stomach. we are trying full spectrum light therpy. i have a co-worker too who says he is bloated and always feels full right now. i do not feel depressed or anything but maybe it is sad (seasonal affective disorder).

Question: what are the odds of having a partial hysterectomy and then getting pregnant? . this situation was presented to me by a friend 40 year old woman hx of partial hysterectomy suddenly finds out she is 12 to 16 weeks pregnant but never knew. states there is a heartbeat and its a girl. next day she goes to the dr and finds out she lost the baby. there were no previous complaints of pain and or bleeding. how likely do you think this story is?
Baseline Response: There are no prior complaints of any sort of pain or bleeding and no previous reports of any problems with the hystretist.
In the same way, there is no prior complaint of any kind of pain, or any other problems with a hystrectomy.
What is the probability of having your baby in a hysectomy?
In a hysteplasty, you have to have your baby at the same time as you have a hyena.

Expected Response: it depends on what she considers a "partial" hysterectomy. if she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero. based on the detail of this story i would seriously doubt its validity.
================================================================================
Question: when is ringworm no longer contagious when swimming in a chlorinated pool? do waterproof bandaids prevent the spread?
Baseline Response: we know that there are no studies on this.

Expected Response: you will not spead ringworm (a fungal infection) through a swimming pool. while it can be spread through direct contact with others who may be susceptible just cover it with that waterproof bandaid so you don't have to explain it. hopefully you are treating it so it should be resolving in a few weeks to a month.
================================================================================
Question: if i'm a smoker under the affordable care act will i have to pay more for health insurance?
Baseline Response: no. The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from charging you more than what you pay for health care. However, if you are under the "premium tax" or "caregiver premium" law, you will be able to choose which coverage you want.
If you are eligible for coverage under a Medicare or Medicaid plan, you can choose whether you plan to use an individualized plan. The cost of your plan is determined by your deductible and is not subject to deductibles or co-pays.
What are the premiums I pay?
The cost of health insurance is determined as follows:
Health insurance premiums are calculated based on your individual medical history.
You must provide medical care to your health care provider (the doctor, nurse, or other health care professional)
You pay the full cost of insurance to the government (i.e., the

Expected Response: the affordable care act does allow insurers to charge smokers a 50% surcharge because of their tobacco use. that can amount to a large increase -- potentially thousands of dollars -- in the cost of health insurance for smokers. and the tax credits available to help lower the cost of insurance premiums cannot be applied to offset the smoking penalty. however insurers do have flexibility in how this surcharge is applied and some states have banned the practice meaning insurers selling in vermont and washington dc for example won't be allowed to charge smokers more for their insurance plan (you can check with your state's department of insurance to learn the law where you live). in addition the law does require insurers to cover treatments that help smokers quit. most employers make smoking cessation programs available as well. and under the law's regulations insurers will not be allowed to charge you the full surcharge if you enroll in a smoking cessation program.
================================================================================
Question: what surgery options do i have for parkinsons disease?
Baseline Response: The most common reason that people have parkinson disease is that they have a history of trauma or trauma to their body. If they have surgery to remove the scar, they will likely have a scar that looks like a large cut.
If a person has surgery to change the scar or repair the scar (which is the most common option), they are probably going to have an infection that can cause them to have a permanent scar.
This is a common problem for people with parkinsonia.
People with parkinonia have a low rate of infection and may have a disease that is not associated with the scar. This means that they may not be able to get surgery or surgery to correct the infection.
Parkinson is a condition that causes people to lose their ability to walk or even walk. It can cause people to have pain, numbness, or a feeling of numbness.

Expected Response: brain surgery may be considered when drugs fails to control symptoms of parkinson's disease or cause severe or disabling side effects. deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) is a technique for treating parkinson's disease. it affects movement by using electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. the electrical impulses are generated by wire electrodes surgically placed in the brain. deep brain stimulation may be used in addition to therapy with levodopa or other drugs when drugs alone do not control symptoms adequately. this technique is the preferred surgical method of treating most cases of advanced parkinson's disease. it does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than older more destructive surgical methods such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy. 6 deep brain stimulation (dbs) neither cures parkinson's disease nor eliminates the need for medicine. dbs of the thalamus is done to treat disabling tremor caused by parkinson's disease. procedures that stimulate the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus control a wider range of symptoms (in addition to tremor) and are used more often than stimulation of the thalamus. pallidotomy and thalamotomy are rarely done anymore. they involve the precise destruction of very small areas in the deep part of the brain that cause symptoms. neurotransplantation surgery is an experimental procedure being studied for the treatment of parkinson's disease. it involves implanting cells that produce dopamine into the brain. information about the effectiveness of neurotransplantation is limited and it is not a proven treatment or a realistic option for most people at this time. surgery choices deep brain stimulation pallidotomy thalamotomy neurotransplantation what to think about a neurologist with special training in parkinson's disease is most often the best kind of doctor to make a decision about surgery. if you might benefit from surgery or deep brain stimulation your neurologist can refer you to a brain surgeon with experience doing these operations. surgery most often becomes a treatment option for people when parkinson's disease progresses to the point that drugs can no longer control symptoms adequately. with advanced disease existing symptoms may get worse or a person may develop new symptoms that drugs cannot control. (however when a person has severe one-sided tremor deep brain stimulation [dbs] may be considered much sooner because this symptom often responds better to dbs than to medicine. ) people who have extremely advanced parkinson's or who have other serious conditions (such as heart or lung disease cancer or kidney failure ) are not usually good candidates for surgery. surgery is usually not considered for people who have dementia or psychiatric disorders. surgery is not a cure for parkinson's disease. drugs are usually still necessary after surgery but surgery can reduce the number and amount of drugs needed to control symptoms. this reduces the side effects caused by drugs while at the same time controlling symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: our son started eating rice cereal at 5 months and veggies/fruit at 6 months. he refuses the solids. any suggestions?
Baseline Response: no, he says he has no idea. I do know that he has a small amount of rice. He is in the process of eating it, but he will not eat it. I'm sure he has some other things he needs to eat, like meat, but I do not know how to tell him. I am not sure what he needs. I believe he has an issue with his stomach and that he is taking certain foods, such as soy, so he will eat those.

Expected Response: you are not experiencing an unusual challenge. many babies at this age go through refusal. be patient maybe give him a break for a couple of days and then try it again. which fruits/veggies have you offered so far and are you making/buying them? the good news is that at this age the majority of calories will come from your baby's milk source (breastmilk/formula). your baby needs a minimum of 4 tablespoons of iron-fortified cereal in order to get enough iron to prevent the onset of anemia. when you reintroduce solids i would try to establish the rice or oatmeal cereal.

Question: are there any over-the-counter treatments for cold sores?
Baseline Response: Yes, we have a number of over- the-counter solutions.
There is a wide range of treatments that are available for cold sore. Most of these include cold resorption, topical anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antiinflammatory, or anti-androgen therapy. However, the majority of these treatments are not effective for colds.
What is the best way to treat a cold sore?
Cold sore is a type of cold sore that can occur when the skin is too dry to support normal growth. It is not a serious medical condition, but it is one that can cause serious side effects, such as:
- Loss of appetite
- Losing or losing control over food intake
- Decreased appetite

- Irritability and fatigue

Some people with cold sore may be able to tolerate a cold-stirring remedy for a short time after

Expected Response: there are some topical medications that can be used for cold sores such as abreva. it comes in a pump dispenser that contains a cream that can be applied. the cold sore may not go away immediately. you may need to use the medication for a few days.

Expected Response: drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel "blood thinners" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval.

Question: what does gallbladder failure spots on liver hypothyroidism and blood loss mean?
Baseline Response: the blood loss is not an indicator of the disease. The blood loss, on the other hand, is a signal of the liver's ability to support the blood supply.
The gallbladders have a number of functions. They are placed on the abdomen and the abdominal wall. They help the liver support the liver in a way that is efficient for the liver. The gallblades are a very important part of the body's defense against disease. They also help the body to absorb toxins. In other words, the liver is the body that helps the body fight off the disease, not the gallblader.
If you have gallblada, you will be able to see the blood in your body. It is an indicator that you have been exposed to toxins. If you have an infection, you may have gallstones. You may be able see the gallstones in your

Expected Response: this could all be a direct correlation for someone who shows the signs of having cancer but before one should speculate go to your primary care doctor or local hospital and have adequate tests done to ensure your health and safety i hope this helps!

Question: can i break the same bone twice. i broke my 3rd metacarpal 10 months ago. this past weekend while doing some work outside my hand started hurting. there was no trauma that i can remember. it has swelled up and is pretty painful. antiinflamitories dont seem to be helping. is it possible i broke it again?
Baseline Response: yes. it is possible.

Expected Response: it would typically require a significant injury again to fracture your metacarpal but the only way you will know for sure it to be examined by your medical provider and perhaps have another x-ray. bones tend to heal well if the fractures were properly lined up but bones can re-break.

Question: is it normal that my period is late? almost 8 days now. i've never had sex so i can't be pregnant. i'm 16 and i'm always regular. it was ramadan recently. so i fasted. and my sleeping pattern kind of messed up. i went to sleep at 4 am and woke up at 3 pm like the whole month. but before that i've always went to sleep at like 11 pm. plus i ate a lot less. everyone says i've lost weight. and i don't know if i should be worried or not. i'd reaaaaaaally appreciate your help.
Baseline Response: it's normal that your period is on late. but it's also normal that you're not getting any good news.

Expected Response: oh thank you so much. i really appreciate this. i was worried but i'm okay now. thanks once again. <positive_smiley>

Question: is itching similar to a yeast infection a symptom of uti or bladder infections? . i have had this issue for about a month. went in for annual examine and doctor said everything looked fine. however the itch continues heaviness/bloated feeling some leaking when i exercise or sneeze no fever or pain but feel sluggish. i am wondering about bladder infection or uti but i have never had either of these so don't know. i am not sexually active and am 45 years old and still getting normal periods.
Baseline Response: yes, and ur bladder is the same as before.

Expected Response: i have had both infections and only had itching with the yeast infection. any discharge? uti's or bladder infections feel more of an urgency to urinate and then you go and its just a few dribbles that causes discomfort. however maybe its in the hair lice etc. it will live in all hair and on surfaces. i'd have this checked out again and if your doctor still says everything is fine ask what you can do to alleviate the symptoms. good luck that feeling is awful as most women know at one time or another!

Question: is metformin used for anything other than treating of diabetes?
Baseline Response: It's used for treating diabetes in the United States. Metformin has been shown to help treat hypertension and some other conditions. MetFormin is used to treat the condition of hypertension.
Metformin is an oral medicine. It is used for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions, and it's the only one that's approved for use in the U.S.
How much does it cost?
A single dose is about $0.75 (about $0/lb).
How do I get it?
The Metformins are given to patients in a blood-brain barrier (BBB).
What's the difference between Metformine and Metformazole?
MetFormin and MetFormazole are the same, but they have different names.
What does Metformines taste like?
It's a sweet, fatty, non-dairy,

Expected Response: metformin is a commonly used medication for diabetes. in addition to helping manage type 2 diabetes it may be used to treat gestational diabetes or diabetes that arises during pregnancy. it has also been used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) a condition in which a woman’s hormones are out of balance.

Question: can i still be pregnant despite 6+ false home tests. sensitive breasts lower backache and iud moved

================================================================================
Question: is tylenol safe to use for “flu” symptoms caused by interferon for hepatitis c treatment? is motrin safer?
Baseline Response: It's not safe to try to use as a treatment for erythrocyte interferons.
2. Is tylenotetrahydrocannabinol safe for —epilepsy‡?

Expected Response: tylenol (acetaminophen) is toxic to the liver in large doses (such as in suicidal attempts where a patient ingests large amounts often more than 10 grams of the medication) and also in situations where a patient drinks alcohol heavily while taking high doses of tylenol. tylenol with alcohol ingestion can be toxic to the liver with lower doses of tylenol than without the alcohol. otherwise for the general population both tylenol and motrin (ibuprofen an nsaids) have low (1%) liver toxicity at the regular recommended doses. moreover both drugs can usually be used in the recommended doses prescribed by a physician reasonably safely for the "flu" symptoms caused by interferon used for treating chronic hepatitis c. with advanced complicated cirrhosis from hepatitis c for which interferon is rarely used all drugs including these must be prescribed with great caution if at all. in addition in these patients with advanced cirrhosis nsaids including motrin can worsen or even precipitate hepatorenal syndrome (a serious condition with both liver and kidney failure) and possibly cause intestinal bleeding.
================================================================================
Question: how long after treatment of a yeast infection(diflucan) should symptoms dissappear?
Baseline Response: This is a very important question. I am not sure if symptoms have disappeared from the patient. I know that it may not be obvious to the patient what has been happening. It's possible that symptoms have changed and I think that the patient has found a way to change the treatment. I do not know if there is a cure, but I am hoping that the symptoms of a bacterial infection will be relieved.
The reason for the symptoms is that the bacterium is active at different times. It can produce many different symptoms. If the patient is ill or sick, it is possible that they are infected by an infection. The symptoms are not identical. The patient is not infected by a bacterium. In this case, it would be very difficult to make a diagnosis.
How long after the infection has cured the patient does it take to return to normal?

Expected Response: diffucan is not a "100% guaranteed" cure so there can be treatment failure. also each person (and each yeast infection) will respond individually so it would be impossible to know how you will respond versus someone else. as a rule most women improve in a few days to a week but again there is no way to conclusively predict an individual response.

Question: daughter takes meds for bi-polar and schitzophrinia but is gaining weight at rapid rate. what can control her appetite?
Baseline Response: A good friend of mine had a story about a young girl who was given a meds prescription. Her parents were not very happy about it and took her to the doctor. She was given several meds and was now eating her own weight. The doctor took her meds in a very slow fashion. The patient started feeling really bad. The doctors said they had no idea what was going on and they were not sure if it was caused by the medication. She got a very good and quick and quick treatment. She is now eating like a normal person and eating the same way as before.
A little bit of history and nutrition is important to help you manage your weight and body image. If you are overweight, it can be difficult to stay in shape and your body is often prone to some kind of problems.

Expected Response: most people with this illness have periodic episodes called relapses when their symptoms surface. while there is no cure for schizoaffective disorder symptoms often can be controlled with proper treatment. read more here <link>

Question: since i had brain surgery before is it bad for my health if my boyfriend pulls my hair roughly? . it's been 12 years since i had brain surgery as a child. all i remember is that until my hair grew back i had a scar on the back of head where they had removed a piece of my skull during the surgery. now my boyfriend grabbed all of my hair and pulled it while kissing me which i loved. but afterwards i noticed something didn't feel right in that area in the back of my head for the next couple of days. is it possible that my previous brain surgery makes hair pulling actually unhealthy?
Baseline Response: yes, but i've always been in love with my hair. i'm not sure if this is the only reason why i have been in this position. i've never had any other problems with my brain or body, i just don't think it's a bad thing to have a problem with your body.

Expected Response: your scalp is really not connected to your brain but your scalp is rich in sensory nerves so forceful hair-pulling may result in some residual discomfort as you have experienced. brain surgery 12 years ago should not preclude playful hair-pulling but if this act causes you pain afterwards it should be avoided no matter how much you loved it.
================================================================================
Question: do you recommend genetic testing for a child with epilepsy?
Baseline Response: yes.
The most common type of epilepsy is type 1 epilepsy. A child with type 1 is at high risk for seizures.
Type 1 seizures are most common in children with epilepsy. They usually occur in the late stages of the first week of life, with some children lasting for 2 weeks or longer.
A child with a type 1 seizure is also at high threat for seizures, especially if they have an underlying seizure disorder.
Treatment for a type 2 seizure is not always available. Children with type 2 seizures may be more likely to develop a life-threatening seizure that lasts for a week or longer and may have a significant impact on their health.
Preventing Type 2
Prevention for a seizure can be difficult. However, treatment for a Type 2 seizure can help to prevent a child from developing a life threatening seizure.
In addition to being able to treat the seizures, treatment can also

Expected Response: epilepsy is a disorder that is primarily diagnosed by history (the character of the episodes) and complemented by the results of other tests such as an mri and eeg. in over half of the cases no cause of the epilepsy is found. for most patients genetic testing is not helpful. there are rare cases of epilepsy where the cause is identified through genetic testing but it is not recommended for the great majority of individuals with epilepsy.

Question: as a man should i tell new partners i may have been exposed to hpv? even though i can not test to be certain? . i have been having unprotected sex with a girl who was recently told she has hpv for about two months. she went back after diagnoses and the gyno told her a bump he found may be a wart. i have never shown any symptoms or warts of any kind so do i definitely have it? am i obligated to tell new partners even though there is no hard proof i have hpv? also if i keep sleeping with her will her infection stay longer as in will we pass it back and forth?
Baseline Response: no, it may be that she is a different person and has a different history and the virus is there for her. If she is not infected, it is not a virus.
Answer #2: I have not tested to be sure but it is still possible that she has been exposed and has been having other illnesses

Expected Response: hi so have you ever been tested? if not then you should. and yes you should always be upfront about anything you have when it comes to having sex this way it does give the other person either male or female the choice to say no. good luck

Question: some drugs' costs have gone through the roof. is this from the new health care? will it affect later on?
Baseline Response: yes.
1. Are there any drug companies that are interested in doing this research?
2. What are the major competitors?
3. How do you think the market is going to respond?
4. How would you describe your research? Would you like to be a part of it?
5. If you can do this, would you like me to do the same?
6. What do you hope to accomplish with this research in the future?
7. Are you looking forward to making the same results for your patients?
8. How much of your research will be funded by the federal government?
9. If this is your first attempt, what are your plans to get your patients on the drug?
10. Do you plan to continue your research in a large clinical trial?
11. How will you

Expected Response: regarding the question about drug costs in actuality 80% of prescription drugs sold in this country are generic -- and prices of drugs haven't risen greatly in the past few years. what has increased however is the portion many of us have to pay toward the cost of our drugs which is likely what you're experiencing. that's not a function of obamacare but rather a funtion of employers (assuming you get insurance at work) and insurers shifting more costs onto consumers as a way of getting control over their own costs. unfortunately that's a trend that's likely to continue.

Question: my husband only coughs and spits mucus during the smoking period. is it the beginning of copd? or is he having from long.
Baseline Response: It's the beginning. We are the first and only smokers. We have to stop smoking. We can't stop smoking in order to get the best results.

Expected Response: long-term smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). if the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of copd. i'd suggest your husband see a doctor about this. the coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking. he will only find out by having a physical exam. keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs. smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body. quitting smoking is always the best option but i realize it can very difficult for some people to do. and some people simply don't want to quit smoking. i hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing. i wish you all the best!

Baseline Response: yes, this is possible. You can try to get the test to show you've been tested and it won't show you. It's better to test positive before you are able to get a repeat test.
Answer to

Expected Response: hi managed to find this bit of info may help you. chlamydia can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes and often women don't find out until they try to start a family and don't fall pregnant. it can also cause pelvic inflammatory disease which is painful and can also scar your fallopian tubes leaving you infertile permanently. it seems it can stay hidden do hope this helps in some way. good luck

Question: why doesn't my 11-month-old have teeth yet?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure why I have teeth. I don't know what it is, but it is weird.
I have two young children, and I have a son, who is 5 years old. I am not sure if he has any teeth. He was on the fence about it, but I told him, "You don't have to have teeth, it's all right." He said, "Yes, I do." He is now 6 years old, and he is very healthy. I have to get him a little bit older to really get him to see it.
Answer, "Oh yeah, I think it's a good thing."
Answer.
If he is healthy and healthy, then he can't have a problem with it. If he is not healthy, he won't have any problems with it, and if he is, then it is normal for him to have problems

Question: if you miss your period how long after will it show positive on test if you r pregnant? how long should u wait to take1. i had a 3day period last month plus it was late. this month i haven't had 1 at all! i am supposed to start my period the 2nd week of the month and i took a pregnancy test and it says negative. i just wanted some advice if i am taking the test to early or if it could be something else because i have had this problem once before but never have had a period only last 3days. i am bloated like and have a lot of discharge. i have took over 8 test within the last month. any advice or help please?
Baseline Response: if i missed my period you are wrong. i mean it is just not normal. if you do miss your periods you are not pregnant. if i miss your test you are pregnant. how long will it be? i have a 3 day period last week plus

Expected Response: no i don't think that your pregnant. i say this because of all the negative test feedback. however i do think that you should see a doctor if you are having such heavy discharge. you could have a number of things going on such as a yeast infection ( which you could try over the counter testing for to determ if that's possibly what it is. they also sell treatment for yeast infections as well. ) you could also have some type of std ( i know that's not what you want to hear. ) i know its not a 100% answer but better to be safe than sorry. if you don't have insurance you can try the free clinic most county's have them. depending on your income you only have to pay a minimum fee or in most cases nothing at all.

Question: can you get pregnant from anal sex even though you are still a virgin?
Baseline Response: It depends on your body type. For example, some people have a very strong anal sex drive and are very confident and confident in their bodies. If you are a virgin, you may not have anal sex. You may have vaginal sex or anal sex with your partner. If it is not possible to have anal intercourse with your partners, it may be a problem.
The best way to get pregnant is with a condom or a condom that you have. Most condoms are made from latex or other silicone. The best thing about latex condoms is that they are made of high quality, latex-free material. The most popular latex condoms are the ones made of 100% latex-containing polymers.
Some condoms are also made of latex-safe polymers like polypropylene (PG), polypropyl (PPD), or polyethylene (PYS). However, many condoms are still made

Question: how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.
Baseline Response: it is really important to have a well-defined pain-relieving treatment for arthritis. In order to help prevent this from happening, you should first know what type of treatment you are getting. In the US, people with arthritis tend to have very low levels of pain-management. This is because they are unable to tolerate pain from their joints. However, in the UK, a lot of people with chronic arthritis will have low levels or low levels. The same goes for people with low levels, such as those

Expected Response: hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically "osteoarthritis" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the "wear and tear" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define "arthritis" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed. i am type 2 diabetic so that could have something to do with it. get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life.

Question: i have a cut on the corner of my mouth that wont heal. what can i use to help?
Baseline Response: I have a small cut on my mouth.
I'm a smallish person. I don't have much mouth. I'm a very good person.
It's hard to tell what to do.
If I'm not doing anything wrong, I'll probably be fine.
But, if I'm doing something wrong, there's no way to tell.
What do you do?
If you have a problem, you should talk to your doctor.
You should talk with your doctor first.
When you go to a doctor, make sure you have the right type of medication.
For me, it's better to take a lot of aspirin or ibuprofen.
And if you're having trouble breathing, you can try some anti-inflammatory drugs like ibupris or ibex.
There's a lot to consider when it

Expected Response: if you're referring to a crack in the corner of your mouth where the upper and lower lips join you may be suffering from perleche known medically as angular cheilitis. perleche can be caused by a fungal infection in which case you'll need to see a doctor for medication to help it heal. the condition also can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin b so you can try taking a vitamin supplement (assuming you're not allergic to any medications or food colorings) or eating more green leafy vegetables which typically contain plenty of different b vitamins. because of the possibility this is a fungal infection i'd suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider for an evaluation. i wish you all the best!

Question: is there another medication besides prednisone that will take down inflammation caused by a severe case of vasculitis. doctors have recently diagnosed this condition in my mother's lower stomach area. prednisone treatment (40mg) after 16 days has done nothing to ease the severe pain or nausea especially after eating. actually the symptoms are getting worse and it seems she is giving up after a 1 year fight with this. is there another medication she can be put on to take away the inflammation so she can have a stint put in? please help me as i believe time is running out.

Baseline Response: - Yes, but it is not necessary to give the baby. The baby will be born in the same way as the woman.




(

Expected Response: a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell.

Question: are there any specific diets for acid reflux?
Baseline Response: This is the most common type of acid reflexion. It is caused by an imbalance between your acidity and your body's acidity, which results in a change in your blood pH. The acidity of your body is determined by your pH, which is what determines your blood's pH.
Caution: This type of reflexive disease is caused mainly by a combination of a low pH and acidity. It can cause a person to feel weak, dizzy or even sick.
What are the best acid refractory diets for you?
1. A balanced diet consisting of a balanced diet with a balanced amount of sugar and carbohydrates
2. A high-fat diet consisting (or not) of high-calorie, low-protein foods
3. A low-carbohydrate diet consisting mainly of a high-protein diet
4. A moderate-fat (low-carb) diet

Expected Response: these are the foods that irritate a damaged esophageal lining and should be limited or eaten in small portions: citrus fruits and juices. tomato products. chili peppers. pepper. spicy food. it's important when you are in an emotional state to try and eat balanced meals and snacks and keep yourself as well nourished as possible because not eating can make matters worse emotionally and physically.

Question: is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.
Baseline Response: is my earthen ear a symptom of my ear infection?
Answer 1: Is your eardrums a symptom to your ear infection or a symptom that could be a symptom for your ear?

Expected Response: no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.

Question: i take sulfamethoxazole-tmp for bronchitis does that mean it can be contagious?
Baseline Response: yes. It's possible. The virus can spread through air, water, saliva, or through your body. The symptoms can include itching, aching, dizziness, and loss of coordination.
Solution: If you are allergic to sulfamethylamine, a sulfamotransferase (STP) inhibitor, you should always consult your doctor or a doctor with whom you are familiar.
Note: if you are an adult, a woman should not have sulfamamine or sulfamodibenzoate for bronchoalveolar disease.

Expected Response: bronchitis is not contagious (you cannot transmit bronchitis to someone else) but the pathogens (viruses bacteria fungus) etc. that are capable of causing bronchitis can be transmitted to others but exposure to these pathogens does not mean that the exposed person will contract bronchitis. they may only get a simple cold. or nothing at all. you are on an antibiotic that may or may not help bronchitis since it is just a clinical guess that the cause is bacterial.

Question: should i have a follow up on my foot? . i walked into my childs toy last friday. i hit it on the left middle of my foot. it instantly swelled up. i went to the er later that night. they took x-rays said there was not anything wrong. well now 5 days later all of my toes are bruised and above my toes. if i hit the side of my foot it hurts and if i walk on it too much it hurts. its still hard to bend my toes and i really don't understand what my toes have to do with that part of my foot. should i go back to the doctor?
Baseline Response: no.
Answer 2: i went back to my doctor on a Friday night. he was in his office on Friday, 3rd of May and he said he didn't want me to go back and he was concerned that i was going to be sick for days. he went and looked at my feet. he said

Expected Response: yes. go back to your doctor to have your foot checked. he or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong. your foot has 26 bones. there are 5 long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot. each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes. tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones. any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons. bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes. possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first x-ray. this is not unusual. your doctor will decide whether further x-rays or other testing is needed.

Question: i have or think i have colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent when should i contact my doctor?
Baseline Response: This is an important question. It is important to note that in most cases, coloregulation is not a significant risk factor for developing colorex, and in some cases, it may even be a risk factor that may be important to have in your medical history. If you have a very severe tumor, you may want to seek the medical care of a specialist before beginning colorection.
If you are diagnosed with colorege, the first thing you should do is ask your doctor to talk to you about the possibility of getting coloreged. If coloreges are not a major cause of your problems, you should talk with your doctor about the possible treatment options.
When should I start colorective therapy?
The first thing to remember is that colorections are not the same as incontinence.
Causes of

Expected Response: some people who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer do not have any symptoms. sometimes it is discovered before symptoms appear either on a chest x-ray or as part of lab tests. you may be seeing a doctor regularly to check for symptoms but symptoms might start between visits. be aware of what is normal for you and tell your doctor about any changes right away. be sure to let your doctor know if you feel even very small changes. what symptoms you may have will depend on which part of your body is affected by the cancer. call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: a change in bowel habits such as bleeding from your rectum bright red or dark blood in your stools frequent diarrhea constipation a feeling that your bowel is not emptying completely or stools that are narrow (may be no wider than a pencil) pain in your belly bloating or loss of appetite unexplained weight loss constant fatigue cough difficulty breathing or shortness of breath bone pain watchful waiting watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without giving treatment to cure your cancer. watchful waiting may be an option if treatment may cause more harm than good and is unlikely to cure your cancer. remember though that watchful waiting does not mean your doctor won't treat your symptoms such as pain. who to see if you have been treated for colorectal cancer doctors who can evaluate any new symptoms include: gastroenterologist. internist. family medicine doctor. colon and rectal surgeon. medical oncologist. radiation oncologist. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: Yes, and it is ok to have them during pregnancy.
Mental Health and Weight Loss
Moral: Do not take these to reduce your mental health or weight loss.
Do not take them to reduce the risk of any serious health problems.
If you feel you may be ill or have an emergency situation, please call your doctor or pharmacist.
The main symptoms of ricola are headache, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, headache, and chest pain.
Coughing
Cougars are not a common cause of illness in the United States. However, there are a number of factors that can contribute to coughing, including:
• Coughing can cause a buildup of mucus or mucus-filled fluid, or a cough.
• People with coughs are more likely to be allergic to certain foods or beverages.
What are the main symptoms?
C

Expected Response: well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.

Question: i recently found out i was pregnant and have a few questions. i was told i was pregnant today. my question are. my doctor did a urine test today he first came in and told me i wasn't then came back 5-10 minutes later. and then told me i was. could it be possible that it was a evaporation line on there test? i'm still waiting for my blood test to come back. now my second question is. i've only lost weight the past couple weeks. i lost 7 lbs. if i'm pregnant is this normal?
Baseline Response: it is normal for a baby to have a lot of weight gain.
Answer 2: if it's not a pregnancy, it is not normal for your baby to weigh more than 5 pounds. the weight gain is a normal process for the baby.

Expected Response: when i found out i was pregnant with my now 5 year old i had a similar situation. my doctor told me i wasn't pregnant but called me when i got home an hour later and told me there was a positive line and it turned out i was pregnant. also when i was pregnant i lost 25 pounds and only gained 15 of it back during my whole pregnancy. to me it sounds pretty normal. hope this helps. good luck

Question: how is anemia related to lead poisoning treated?
Baseline Response: anemia is the disease that causes lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is a disease caused by a cause of lead contamination, or contamination of the blood supply. Lead contamination is caused by the lead in a given sample. If you are diagnosed with lead poisoning, you will need to look at the blood sample for lead and the blood in the drinking water. The blood sample is the only thing that can show whether the blood is contaminated with lead or not.
The blood samples are also the only things that can tell if you are having a lead poisoning or not and you should take the blood samples for a blood test.
In addition, you should always take a blood sample of any blood that is contaminated by lead.
How to treat anemia
What is an anemia? Anemia is an abnormal condition where the blood that you drink is contaminated or is in an unsafe state. Anemia can be caused by:
Lead

Expected Response: lead poisoning is treated by discontinuing exposure to lead and administering a drug that binds and draws lead out of the body.
================================================================================
Question: can being inoculated with growth hormone as a child eliminate a person from donating blood now and in the future? why?
Baseline Response: I do not know. I don't know what I should do. But, I don' know. It's a matter of people not being able to see their child and not being aware of their child's illness. I do know that the amount of growth hormone that you get from your baby is not that much. And so, I do have a question that I'm not sure is the right answer. I've tried to answer it.
A couple of people have asked me about it and I don\'t know. So, I think that I would say that that's probably the best answer. But I think you should be able to find out what the answer is, and that's what I do.
I think that if you were to ask a person about the situation and you said, "How many children do you think you would

Expected Response: i don't think that would be a problem but then again blood banks set their own rules. those human growth hormones have been long gone in your case so there is really no way that your blood would harbor any residuals in my opinion.
================================================================================
Question: how much weight should i gain during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: Women who have been pregnant for at least 3 months should gain at least half their weight during their pregnancy.
Your weight should be determined by the formula: Weight in kg* (kg-1) * Weight in kilograms divided by 3 (kg).
Question (1) : How much should

Expected Response: pregnancy doesn't equal a get-out-of-jail-free card for a caloric spending spree. if you gain too much weight you're at risk for conditions like gestational diabetes; too little and your baby may be born at a low birth weight. what's "just right" for you? if you're at a normal weight before pregnancy gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. if you are overweight before pregnancy gain 15 to 25 pounds. if you are underweight prior to pregnancy gain 28 to 40 pounds. for multiple births consult your doctor (usually you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds for twins). the average woman should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during her first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of her pregnancy.

Question: constant eye drainage including during sleep puffiness around eye top and bottom. i caught a cold approx. one week ago. since the beginning i have one eye that just drains constantly. the inner corner of my eye and just below the eye has become extremely irritated from the constant wiping/drying with a tissue is somewhat red around the outside of my eye. there has also been some slight lid swelling/puffines and very puffy under the eye when i wake in the morning. i have no idea if this is an infection or if i can do some otc "fix".
Baseline Response: I've had a lot of problems with my eye at night. i've seen some weird side effects such as vision loss, and eye discoloration. I've been using a different kind of eye care product, and i've found that it's been more effective in some cases than others. I have noticed that the color of my eyes has changed over the years, and that i've noticed

Expected Response: constant eye drainage should always be checked. if you have possibly damaged your cornea it could be leaking out slowly. it is very important to have it checked by your eye doctor. in some cases it is just allergies to something in the air. it can also be a problem with the tear ducts. but if it contiues with no let up do see a doctor.
================================================================================
Question: could i be pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes, but I would need to have a medical doctor. I would also need to be insured. I do not want to have to wait for the insurance company to issue an insurance policy, but if I did have to have insurance, I would be able to choose if I wanted to go to the doctor or not.
Answer to

Expected Response: the only way to know for sure you're pregnant is with a pregnancy test. but there are early symptoms of pregnancy that can alert you to the fact that you may be pregnant and should have a test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. some women are so attuned to their body and the changes it undergoes with pregnancy that they seem to know from the start they are pregnant. other women though have no suspicion they are pregnant until they miss their first period which is perhaps the most widely recognized early sign of pregnancy.

Question: itchy feeling in middle of urethra comes and goes. i have this itchy feeling in the middle of my urethra that comes and goes i don't have the feeling every day. also it seems as when i drink water it makes the itch go away and when i urinate it helps to relieve the itch. i have no other symptoms not burning or discharge. ive tried to search this on the web and everything comes up std but i have none of those symptoms esp. cause it's not the tip of the inside of my penis. also one other time i searched i got prostate issues.
Baseline Response: it's the tip. it's very painful to get to that point. i tried to go to the bathroom but I was very irritated so i asked for a refill.
I think it's because I have this weird feeling in my ureters. itchy, the feeling of the urethral opening, and the feeling that the ureter is

Expected Response: hi see if this helps you and your penis just to follow some basic care regimens: drink at least 2 litres of water everyday. drink cranberry juice if possible as this acidifies urine and is a rich source of vitamin c which would help eliminate any mild infection. maintain hygiene in the affected area. wash your penis gland and opening with warm sea water do let it get inside your penis. avoid the use of any harsh chemicals at or near the urethral orifice. avoid the use of alcohol caffeine and spicy foods. eat fresh vegetables - especially green leafy vegetable. i do hope this helps in some way. good luck
================================================================================
Question: i have combination skin. which kind of foundation will suit me?
Baseline Response: It depends on the foundation you choose. If you are using a lot of foundation, you will need to choose a foundation that is more flexible. For example, if you have a lot in the back of your neck that needs to be fixed, it will need a lot more coverage. If your body is not quite as flexible as it should be, you may want to go with a foundation with a less flexible coverage.
The foundation you use depends on how much you use it. If it is more or less than you need, you can adjust your amount to make it more or more durable.
I am a huge fan of the Tamiya line of foundation. I use this foundation for the foundation I use for my body and for the skin I use to make my face look younger. I like to use it for the back, shoulders, and all my other areas.
When you use Tamiya

Expected Response: if your skin is very oily look for compounds that are "oil free. " for dry skin look for compounds that are non-comedogenic and hydrating. for combination skin first determine if your skin is more oily or dry and go from there. cream-to-powder bases work great for combination skin. mineral foundations work well on all skin types especially sensitive skin.

Question: i've been on paxil and klonopin for 20 years and now i have vertigo. is there a connection? . how long is too long to be on medication and can it cause vertigo?
Baseline Response: no. there are no treatments for vertigo and vertigo can occur.

Expected Response: there can be hundreds (yes hundreds) of causes of vertigo. it would not be likely that medication that you have be taking for the last twenty years would suddenly cause vertigo so it would not be high on this list. check with your primary care provider first. but you may need to see a neurologist or ent specialist (since the inner ear problems are common causes) to start the evaluation process.
================================================================================
Question: is shingles contagious?
Baseline Response: Yes. It is the virus that causes shingled eyes.
It is a viral infection that can be transmitted by a person who is infected with the virus.
The virus is usually in the form of a small, oval-shaped protein called a virus. In shingling eyes, the virus is produced in the blood and forms a small pore that is filled with antibodies to the virus, which then cause the eye to glow red. This red glow can be caused by the redness of the eyes, which can then be seen as a sign of infection.
Shingling eye diseases are characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including light-colored, red-colored eyes and dark-colored or dark circles in the eyes. Signs of shingler eye disease include light-headedness, redness, blue-green or purple-green eyes, red spots on the cheeks, and redness.
There are

Expected Response: as stated in the answer in order to contract the virus from someone with shingles a person would have to never have had chickenpox. additionally the person would have to never have had the chickenpox vaccine. if they've had chickenpox or the vaccine they would not be susceptible to contracting the virus.

Question: what is the advantages and disadvantages of a baby girl having o- blood group?
Baseline Response: the o- group has a higher proportion of O- and A-group members.
This is the reason why o- and O- group are considered as the only ones to be suitable for o- or A- and o- alone.
The o-group is the most important one.
A baby girl with o- is a woman, but the o group is the only one to have the o blood group.
O- group is a family which includes one or more children.
There are two kinds of o- groups: o- + A- + B- - A-
The difference is that o- has more members. o- plus A- is the number of members. The number of O members is the total number of children. It is the ratio of number of adults in the group to number of babies in the o-, A-, B-, or

Expected Response: there are no real advantages or disadvantages. it is just a less-common blood type.
================================================================================
Question: does aspirin help prevent heart attacks and strokes?
Baseline Response: yes, it does. But if you have a heart attack or stroke, it is important to stop taking aspirin. If you do, you should stop taking the drug.
The World Health Organization recommends that a person be given aspirin for one to two weeks before they begin taking aspirin for a heart condition.
If you have one of these conditions, you may need to stop the drug for two weeks. If it is not possible to stop, your doctor can recommend that you stop taking it.
What are the risks of taking aspirin?
The risks of aspirin are very high. People with a high risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart attacks may develop serious problems with their blood pressure. They may also develop anemia, liver problems, or anemia.
People with low risk of stroke may develop heart problems and heart attack. They can also develop heart disease.
Who should be consulted about aspirin? If you

Expected Response: i want to. talk about the use of aspirin for prevention of heart attacks strokes and other blood clotting problems. aspirin is commonly used for minor aches and pains and to reduce fever. aspirin also combats the effects of platelets blood cells that help blood clot. this helps reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes. indeed platelets are essential to human life because an excessively low count would cause bleeding. but platelets can also be involved in too much clot formation. when this occurs it can block a blood vessel and can lead to many potentially life-threatening problems including heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). it’s important to achieve a balance between too much clotting and not enough clotting. there is much confusion regarding the use of aspirin in prevention of heart attack and stroke. the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke — called primary prevention — is widely debated. there have been approximately seven clinical trials testing the effects of aspirin in someone with no prior history of heart attack or stroke. the doses have varied from 50 mg to 500 mg. while not all the trials showed benefit only one trial showed an increased risk of bleeding but those were patients on high dose aspirin. based on this ambiguous data the current american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention only in men with diabetes and intermediate cardiovascular risk and without an increased risk of bleeding. those patients who have a 10% risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period are defined as intermediate risk. the european society of cardiology guidelines do not recommend aspirin in primary prevention. in patients with previous stroke heart attack or certain other blood clotting problems aspirin has beneficial effects. for these people the american college of cardiology/american heart association guideline recommends starting aspirin 75 mg to 162 mg and continuing indefinitely in all patients unless other medical problems prevent its use. the benefits of aspirin need to outweigh the risk. yes it sure does. seven months ago my pulse went from around 55 to 65 count to over 200 beats. my blood pressure was steady at the 120 over 60. i was on a 325 coated aspirin since my by pass in 1999. i was on vacation at the time and when i seen my family doctor three weeks after it started he told me i had af and thanks god i was talking a 325 aspirin. my heart doctor agreed and now i am on pradax blood thinner. i have fluid in the lungs from the leaking blood and on a 40mg water pill. thank you toe fanjoy my hands and legs have been tingling and my right side has a pain can not move or cough it hurts

Question: how common is depression during and after pregnancy?
Baseline Response: It is very common in pregnancy.
(2)

Expected Response: depression that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after delivery is called perinatal depression. the exact number of women with depression during this time is unknown. but researchers believe that depression is one of the most common complications during and after pregnancy. often the depression is not recognized or treated because some normal pregnancy changes cause similar symptoms and are happening at the same time. tiredness problems sleeping stronger emotional reactions and changes in body weight may occur during pregnancy and after pregnancy. but these symptoms may also be signs of depression.

I am trying to get on the site but there is no way i can get it to be there.
The website is closed but i am going to get a new website that will allow me

Expected Response: the main way we first determine how far along a woman is in her pregnancy is by her period. further along in the pregnancy we can use other indicators including ultrasound. at this point there really is no way for you to know so you should go ahead and make an appointment with your doctor to touch base. they may want to do an ultrasound to get an idea of how far along you are.

Expected Response: anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimer’s knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and it’s often anyone’s guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (let’s call it rbd for short). the facts: * with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to “act out” your dreams. translation: you’re not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep. * these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: you’re not getting the restful sleep you need. * rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson’s disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. it’s not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinson’s as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinson’s disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? we’ve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia — eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise — both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good night’s sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking: * one in three people over 65 will die with dementia. * twenty percent of us don’t get enough sleep — banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average. * heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly “harmless” struggle to get a good night’s sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep.

Question: i have a sprained neck and have been seen by two different doctors. can i take two medications together as directed? . one doctor prescribed vicodin and the other prescribed nabumetone 750 mg.
Baseline Response: I have been told by my doctor that the two doctors prescribed Vicodin 750 mg are in fact the same doctor.

Expected Response: i have a sprained neck and have been seen by two different doctors. one prescribed vicodin and the other prescribed nabumetone 750 mg. can i take both together as directed on each bottle? i do not recommend taking both without consulting one of the prescribers. these medications both treat pain but in different ways. they will not interact or increase toxicity levels from the ingredients. however it is important to check with your health care professional and keep them all in the loop about all the medications you are taking or have been prescribed.

Baseline Response: what do you mean by a one testicles?

Question: i had a 3-vessel by-pass in 1988 with 3 stents from 2009-2011. . does this medical history affect my health insurance premium?
Baseline Response: yes, the following information is necessary for you to determine if your insurance will be affected:
1. How much of your deductible is due by the end of the year?
2. How long before your deductible starts?
3. How many days have you been in the hospital?
4. How often have you visited your doctor?
5. How big is your prescription medication?
6. How old are you?
7. How far from your home are you from your doctor (in the same room)?
8. How frequently have you had a family member visit you? (this is not included in your coverage)
9. How frequent has your doctor visited you? 2-3 times a year? (the number is more likely to be a 1)
10. Do you

Expected Response: medical history can no longer be taken into consideration by insurers. everyone is guaranteed insurance; you can't be turned down or charged more for coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition.

Question: how dangerous is it to self perscribe adderall or ritalin. i have a very hard time concentrating and i am doing a master degree not a good combination. i am working in a far corner of the middle east and don't have easy access to doctor but these types of meds can be bought locally legally i am told.
Baseline Response: it is very dangerous to self adderal. it is just a question of when and how. you can get it by going to the pharmacy or calling a local clinic and you will get a prescription. it takes time. do not go to the doctor to get it. you may get a free prescription but i know that you will be waiting for a doctor that will give you a prescription for your condition.
You have to get your doctor to make sure you are getting the correct dose of med and then he or she will tell you what is in your med that you need to get to the hospital.
It is

Expected Response: it is not wise to self-prescribe this potentially-addicting medication -- a potent stimulant. if you do not have a medical need for these drugs stay away from them. this is no different than self-prescribing "speed" or any other amphetamine simply because you are tired or want to stay awake.

Question: should a late thirties female double transplant kidney-pancreas be able to have children? . could it harm her in any way to get pregnant? . she is in her 5th year since her transplants
Baseline Response: A young girl with a liver transplant has been diagnosed with liver cancer. However, there are no indications that she is at risk for any other problems.
We have been told that the woman's liver cancer is very serious. We have also heard that she has a number of liver problems, including a liver tumor.
Her liver is so small that it is difficult to see what is going on.
It is very hard to see the liver cells in her body, so she has to see them in her liver.
So she has an extremely difficult time getting her organs into her body.
The liver transplant is also not a good way to raise funds for the cause.
Now, she has been given a kidney to use as a

Question: where are some good places to walk for exercise?
Baseline Response: in the mountains and valleys, the mountains are where we will be most comfortable, and the valleys are where you will be the most comfortable.
Do you know where you can go for a walk? I have a good walker friend in the UK and I have also a good friend in France who is a walker and has a good attitude, so I can go where I want.
Where do you get your exercise from?
I have had a good range of places to go and a good variety of people to go to. It's not just about the exercise, it's about the lifestyle and the exercise itself. There are lots of great places to get some exercise, but you can also buy some exercise equipment.
Are you a vegan?
Yes, I'm a vegan, so you can get some of the good stuff from my website, including all the vegan stuff.
So what do you think

Expected Response: the beauty of walking is that it can be done anywhere. here are some suggestions: when you travel (a great way to explore a new city). around your block. your local track. architectural walking tours. mall walking is great for cold or rainy conditions and it's great for social support and meeting new people. call your local mall to find out when its walking club meets (most of the time it's before the mall opens). trails in your local park. enter road races sponsored by your local running or walking club. many running clubs sponsor walking events too and plenty of people walk road races even when people are running. check out your local clubs. american volkssport association : a network of 350 noncompetitive walking clubs that organize more than 3 000 walking events per year in all 50 states. rails-to-trails : a nonprofit organization that converts abandoned railroad tracks into biking hiking and walking trails. go hiking. it's walking in the woods! check out the american hiking society for clubs in your area. check out local walks for causes in your area. the american heart association american diabetes association and many others sponsor local walking events. walk your dog!

Question: i get a salty taste in my mouth after i brush and rinse. what causes this?
Baseline Response: i am allergic to this. i have never had this in my life. the smell of the dog is overwhelming, i cant eat or drink anything, the dog bites me, i can't breathe, the smell is overpowering. i got this when i was 5 years old and i was really into dogs. i thought it was something that would be a nuisance but i didnt know what it was, i had no idea what to do with it. i went into the vet and they gave me a prescription for this medication and i got it. so i was told that i would get it and that i could get it from my vet. i was so happy! the smell was so strong that i didn't want to leave it on the floor or anything. i took it to the vet for the first time and it was so good that i didnt even notice it. the vet said

Expected Response: a salty taste in your mouth could result from a gum or decay problem or it could be a byproduct of a mouth rinse or toothpaste. sinus problems leaky crowns and fillings and certain metabolic health issues can also be a factor causing the salty taste to develop. get an examination from a dentist. you may also need a referral to see a doctor who is an ear nose and throat specialist.

Question: what is the connection between mitral valve prolapse and fibromyalgia?
Baseline Response: The fibromyalgic disease of fibromyelitis (fibromyalgia) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system. The fibroid tissue of the central nerves is the main source of pain in fibromyelia. It is usually a problem of the peripheral nerves, which is the cause of fibroid pain.
Fibromyelia is a fibromyic disease that affects many parts of the body. It affects the body's ability to produce hormones and hormones that produce pain. It can cause fibromyeal disease, which means that the fibroid gland is damaged and the fibrous tissue becomes inflamed.
The fibromyelin is an abnormal fibrous fibrous structure that makes the fibroids and nerves of the brain and spinal cord. The tissue that is damaged by fibromyal disease is called the fibrotic tissue. This fibrotia is caused

Expected Response: mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is often seen in fm. i conducted a study years ago at the ohio state university and published results that showed the majority of people with fm also had evidence of mvp on cardiac echo testing. mvp is a condition where one of the heart valves the mitral valve bulges excessively during the heartbeat. although it sounds scary most doctors feel that mvp is usually a benign condition. it may contribute to atypical chest wall pain in some patients with fm or it may be part of the dysfunctional autonomic nerves and contribute to rapid heart rate palpitations and shortness of breath in some. we're not sure exactly why those with fm seem to have more mvp than the general population. perhaps there is a genetic factor involved or a dynamic change that results from the dysfunctional autonomic nerves. more research is needed in this area. chest pain in fm is usually not angina but people with fm can have other problems too including heart problems. if there is ever any questions about chest pain or new cardiac symptoms a physician should be consulted at once.

Question: can fatty liver disease be reveresed
Baseline Response: yes, as long as the liver is functioning normally.
What does the question mean?
The question is: can the liver be reverenced?
In this article, we will discuss the main aspects of the question, the treatment of fatty liver diseases and the treatment for fatty liver conditions.
1. Treatment of Fatty Liver Disease
The treatment of a fatty liver condition is often seen as a treatment of the body's own problems, i.e. the problem of its own metabolism.
Fatty liver disease is a condition of the liver that is caused by the excessive use of alcohol. It is a problem that has been associated with alcoholism and is usually caused by excessive consumption of alcohol by the alcoholic.
It is not known how often alcohol is involved in fatty liver problems.
A study by the European Commission found that over a five-year period, the number of alcoholic cases in the European Union had increased

Expected Response: that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: 1. stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. 2. lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to 10% of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. 3. if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. 4. eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!

Question: i sprained my ankle over a month ago and i still have pains. . . i am sure it was over a month ago give or take a few days. but i am still experiencing pains in the back of my ankle on top and on the side some. i have went to the doctor and they did an x-ray and said things looked fine but since i am still having problems i feel like something else is wrong. could i possibly have a fracture or is it just a prolonged pain? .
Baseline Response: i have had a couple of broken bones in my leg. I have had three surgeries and I am very worried about my future. i am not sure if i will ever be able to walk again. i need to do something about it.
Answer. i was sitting in the bathroom when i noticed a disc in my ankle. i went to check it out and it looked like a disc had been cut. and i immediately went to see my doctor. he was very

Expected Response: an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.
================================================================================
Question: can i lose weight going on a sugar free diet? . can u tell me how much weight can i lose in a month using this sugar free diet.
Baseline Response: yes.
1. Can you tell me the difference between a diet with high fructose corn syrup and a diet without it?
Answer 1: I don't know.
2. Can I lose weight using this diet without a sugar Free diet?

Expected Response: yes but that is only part of the equation. permanently losing weight requires more than a short-term committment otherwise you will just gain it back.
================================================================================
Question: what is bun-creatinine ratio?
Baseline Response: A bun-caffeine ratio of 0.7% is considered as a "bad" bun-curve, which means it is less desirable than a good bun-doughnut. However, if you want to have a bun-cake with a very good bun, you can use a bun cake that is at least as good as the one that you want.
Bun cakes are a great way to have the best bun-canning experience. You can get a lot of good bun cakes at the store.
One of the best ways to get a good Bun Cake is to buy a bun from the store and take it home to your house.
For a good Buns, there are several varieties of bun cakes. One of them is bun cake, which is made with some type of cake and is much more popular than bun cake. The bun cakes are made with the kind of bun that is

Expected Response: bun stands for blood urea nitrogen. creatinine is a natural product of muscle breakdown that occurs at a low level in the body. both bun and creatinine are filtered by the kidney and excreted in urine. for this reason bun and creatinine are used together to measure kidney function. if kidney function begins to decline bun and creatinine rise. a normal creatinine depends on muscle mass and age. in general a normal creatine is 0. 5 to 1. 2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). a normal bun is 7 to 20 mg/dl. remember that different laboratories use different testing equipment and may have slightly different ranges for normal. a small temporary increase in either bun or creatinine can occur during illness or dehydration; the numbers usually return to normal during recovery. in cases of dehydration bun may increase in a higher proportion than the creatinine. a normal bun-to-creatinine ratio is between 10 to 1 and 20 to 1. (for example a bun of 14 and a creatinine of 1. 2 would be a ratio of 12. ) in cases of dehydration the bun-to-creatinine ratio may be higher than 20 to 1 as the kidney responds by making the urine more concentrated. other conditions that cause bun-to-creatinine ratio to rise are kidney disease kidney stones or bleeding in the intestines. low bun-to-creatinine can occur in pregnancy liver disease or a diet low in protein. the bun-to-creatinine ratio is not a precise or reliable test though. it may often be somewhat abnormal in healthy people. more important is the creatinine level itself; if it’s elevated the kidneys are not working properly and the reason should be sought out. i'm very concern about my kidney health since i'm getting older. my father and two of my brothers contracted kidney diisease in their 60's. all are deceased. recent ly i had bloodworkand my bun/creatinine ratio came back high (31) do i need to be concern? my doctor is well aware of my family history for this. thanks 1. 2 to 30 10 answer

Question: can a-fib cause heart failure. iam in 100% a-fib even with my pacemaker. will this cause heart failure. does it increase my chance of stroke.
Baseline Response: the answer is yes.
Your body produces hormones that make you more susceptible to heart disease. They may help you deal with certain diseases, but they do not cause you to die of heart disease or stroke. These hormones can also cause a buildup of blood clots in your arteries and cause blood clotting.
What happens when your body produces these hormones?
Your arteries will get larger and you'll get more blood clotted. This is called a buildup, and it can lead to a heart attack.
If you have a heart disease, you may have a buildup or buildup of clots, and if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, you are more likely to have a Heart Attack:
You start to feel a lot of blood and feel very tired

Expected Response: unfortunately it can cause heart failure and does increase your chance of stroke. however there are many people who live with a fib and for a long time for that matter! i hope they find something that works for you!
================================================================================
Question: could my saliva cause my wife to get a yeast infection in her vagina?
Baseline Response: my wife's vagina is a tiny little hole that is filled with mucus, so when she gets infected, she will have yeast infections.

Expected Response: only if you had yeast in your mouth.
================================================================================
Question: are there special side effects that can occur with cortisone joint injections?
Baseline Response: cortisones are commonly used to treat the pain caused by arthritis, but some medications, such as cortisoids, have been shown to cause side effects. These side effects may include:

Reduced ability to feel pain

Lowering of appetite

Increased weight gain

Decreased ability to walk

Depression and anxiety

Low blood pressure

Trouble sleeping

Pain sensitivity

No changes in heart rate or blood pressure due to medication

Other side effects associated with corticosteroids include:

Expected Response: cortisone injections into a joint may have side effects in addition to those described above. unique side effects of joint injections involve injury to the joint tissues particularly with repeated injections. these injuries include thinning of the joint cartilage weakening of the ligaments of the joint increased inflammation in the joint (arthritis) due to a reaction to a corticosteroid that has crystallized and introduction of infection into the joint.

Question: can a girl get pregnant with an unsevered hymen? . if you ejaculate a small amount of semen on the outside of a vagina of a virgin girl and she wipes her vagina off afterwards and takes a shower can she still get pregnant and what are the chances?
Baseline Response: if you are a virgin you can get pregnant if you have sex with a man and you ejaculated semen on your penis.

Expected Response: it is possible to become pregnant without full-penetration sex. while it may be uncommon ejaculation at the vaginal opening does put this woman at risk for pregnancy. if you do not want an unintentional pregnancy you should not be doing this sort of risky activity. keeping viable sperm as far away as possible from a vagina would be in your best interest. use a condom or stop playing sexual russian roulette.
================================================================================
Question: i get boils/absesses in my pubic area but they only happen at certain times of the year like fall/winter. . they start out as just a small red bump but usually get to the size of a quarter. they make a head and some pus and blood drain out but may remain red and hard under the skin for a week or so.
Baseline Response: they are usually on a "dry" or "clean" skin, but usually on the skin that is normally healthy.

Expected Response: it may have sometime to do with your fall/winter attire. many of these boils start out as folliculitis (an infection around the hair follicles) so heat and/moisture in this area can be contributory to seasonal outbreaks. i don't know if you are shaving in this area but this too can be a factor.
================================================================================
Question: i recently got a rash on one side of my face. could a change in birth control pills be causing this rash?
Baseline Response: yes, it was happening to me. i was using birth control and it was a very bad rash. i have been on birth control for about 2 years now. I am very concerned about this rash and hope this is the cause.
Answer
Answer


I have a very high blood pressure and I was using the birth control to prevent my heart from beating. I had a very low blood pressure in my face and the rash was a sign of a very serious heart attack. I was taken to the emergency room and had my blood pressure checked. I have not had any problems. I will be taking birth control again.

Answer

Expected Response: it is possible. any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect. however not all new symptoms are caused by medications. you would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash.
================================================================================
Question: how can toxoplasmosis during pregnancy be prevented?
Baseline Response: toxoplasma is not a disease of the ovaries and is not caused by any disease of your reproductive system.
Toxoplasma infection is caused by the same virus as that of the gonadotropin (a hormone that regulates the body's production of testosterone). When the immune system attacks the ovary, it stimulates a type of "pregnancy immune response" that prevents the ovum from producing more sperm. The ovum, in turn, secrete a small amount of testosterone, which is then transferred to the uterus. This process can be blocked by the use of antibiotics, which are used to prevent infection.
How can this be prevented during pregnancy?
Toxicology tests are performed to determine if the virus is present in the ovule, and are usually done by an urologist.
A blood test is used to determine the presence of toxoplasms, and is often performed

Expected Response: if you are not pregnant (or not planning to be pregnant soon) and have a healthy immune system you do not need to prevent toxoplasmosis infection. it is a passing infection with mild or no symptoms. if you have had toxoplasmosis you cannot get it again. this is because your immune system has learned how to fight it. this immunity protects both you and your fetus from toxoplasmosis. you can have a blood test to learn whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis. if you are pregnant or plan to be pregnant soon if you do not know whether you are immune to toxoplasmosis or know that you are not immune avoid contact with the toxoplasma parasite to protect your fetus from infection. avoid cat feces in both the home and the garden. if you have a cat and you are either pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon have someone else clean the cat litter box. if you must clean the box yourself do it daily. the toxoplasma eggs take 1 to 5 days to become infectious. 4 wear gloves and a face mask and wash your hands afterward. make a habit of washing any table or counter surfaces that a cat may have walked across. consider keeping your cat indoors. a cat who goes outdoors is likely to become infected with toxoplasma gondii by eating infected birds or rodents. (eating indoor mice also poses a risk. ) when gardening or handling soil wear gloves and wash your hands afterward. wash all foods that could have had contact with cat feces including commercial fruits and vegetables. eat only well-cooked or previously frozen meat. avoid dried meats. sustained high or low temperatures are needed to kill toxoplasma gondii in meat. carefully wash your hands and all utensils after preparing raw meat poultry seafood fruits or vegetables. avoid untreated drinking water. this is a concern when you are in the wilderness or are traveling to developing countries where drinking water is not treated. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: does alcoholism have an effect on congestive heart failure? my husband drinks 12 beers a day and is very bloated.
Baseline Response: It's not a problem. It's just that I've been drinking so much that I'm not getting the benefits of alcohol.
Source: http://www.health.co.uk/publications/article-11.cfm?id=1350
The first question that I get when I'm drinking is: "What's the difference between an alcoholic and a non-agricultural drinker?"
Source.
There are two main kinds of alcoholic drinks.
The alcoholic drinks include beer, wine, spirits, and spirits. The non-alcoholic drinks include liquor, tequila, spirits (soda), and spirits (alcoholic beverages).
The alcoholic drinks are consumed by the alcoholic, but not by the non-abstinent.
Here are the main types of alcohols that are consumed:
(1

Expected Response: excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of congestive heart failure by causing a cardiomyopathy -- which is a medical term used to describe weakness of the heart muscle. this can result in swelling like your husband is experiencing. in addition liver damage from alcohol can also cause swelling. it sounds as though he should see a doctor urgently to try to help treat his symptoms and he would benefit greatly from some assistance to help him stop drinking.

Baseline Response: inside my left eye and palate tonsil was swollen and swollen and white. i have had a lot of fun with it and i'm sure it will keep getting better. Please help!
Anonymous 08/11/16 (Tue) 06:25:28 AM

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. i want to caution you however that you should never self-administer antibiotics. it's this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. your best bet is to see a medical professional. your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work. it could as you speculate be a virus. if it is it should clear up in 7-14 days. no antibiotics required. however it could be something other than a virus. many conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth. the only way to find out is to visit a health care provider. i wish you all the best!

Question: could i be pregnant? . i had sex with a friend 1 day before my fertile window. my period ended may 13 and fertile window starts may 18. and i'm three days late for my period and a took a pregnancy test and it was negative.
Baseline Response: Yes, i am pregnant. I am in a position to make a decision about whether or not to have a baby. I will make a choice in order to be able to have an abortion. I think the most important decision is to get on with my life, I am very happy and in love with my husband. I feel that I am a good and happy woman. I hope that my family will not feel that way. If they do, I think I will have a happy, happy life. I wish my family a happy and happy future. Thank you for your time.

Expected Response: hi and do we want to be pregnant? ok for now all you can do is wait around 4 more days then see your doctor and get a blood test done and see how that pans out. you could be just having a skipped or missed period if you have been stressing over this little event. if you are pregnant you could think of the abortion pill if your not interested at this time unless you want to keep it for me that would be your choice. and if your not pregnant then its time you was thinking of getting some kind of bc like the pill unless your body cant take it. but you have to remember safe sex is the best sex. good luck

Question: i am a 55 year old woman not menopausal not overly stressed. i am biploar. what is causing increased forgetfullnes. i see my doctors and follow their advice. forgetfulness is affecting my life in that i have difficulty processing to the point of not even having 'gears' turning. my family is concerned. this has progressively worsened during the last two years or so. i am bipolar but have been stable for many years. i have undergone major stressful situations during last 5 years but have resolved most of the situations and am relatively stress free now. i have an appointment with a neuro-psychologist.
Baseline Response: i do not believe that the reason why people are not in a mood is because they are in a state of depression. i believe that people are in depression because they have had too much stress in the past and the current stress has become unbearable. i think that people who have been in a depression for long periods of time will find that they are

Question: what is a nervous breakdown?
Baseline Response: a nervous break is a mental breakdown in which you have to act on a mental state.
It's a mental mental state that you have been thinking about for a long time.
You don't have to do it in the usual way.
There is no need to do this, there is no reason to do that.
If you have a nervous mood, you can get up and go to bed.
But if you are going to sleep, you have no way of getting up and going to work.
When you go to work, you get up to go to school.
And when you go out, you don't even have the chance to go out to dinner.
So if you have nervous breakdowns, you will have to put on your work clothes and go out on the streets.
Your work clothes have to stay on and on and off the streets, even if you don`t have any other work

Expected Response: nervous breakdown is not a clinical term so it doesn’t mean anything specific to doctors. people may use nervous breakdown to describe an episode of severe emotional distress. the word “breakdown” may suggest the person showed unusual behavior or stopped performing his or her expected duties at home or work. people described as having a nervous breakdown may or may not meet the criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis.

Question: can pacemaker lead cause a chest muscle twitch. i have a st jude pacemaker and lift weights. i just started getting a muscle twitch in my left pectorail muscle. it is very random and it doesn't seem to affect my heart rate. is this common or should i have it checked?
Baseline Response: common and not common.
I have a small st judes pacemaker. it causes a chest musculature muscle twitch, which is very uncommon. but if it does, I think the cause is usually a chest twitch. I'm sure the cause of this is that my chest muscle is not moving properly. I can't tell you how many times i have this happen. If it does happen, it is usually from a small muscle twitch on the side of the chest, usually a small twitch on my left side. If i am not sure, then it is normal.
If i have chest muscle that is not in my chest, then I am not

Expected Response: while it's possible for people to experience muscle stimulation from pacemakers it's typically the diaphragm as it lies close the the right ventricle which is actually being paced. while i can't diagnose the cause of your muscle twitching in this forum i would guess that left pectoralis stimulation would be pretty unlikely particularly if it doesn't seem related to your heart rate. always helpful to get checked out by your doctor if you have any concerns.

Question: does lung cancer mestasis to the brain?
Baseline Response: There is no reason for a person to believe that their brain cancer is not caused by lung cancer, but rather by an organ that is affected by it. This organ can be an organ of the brain or a brain tumor.
The reason for the absence of a brain cancer in a person is that the brain is not being stimulated to produce the brain cancer.
In fact, this is the case with lung cancer. The brain cancer occurs when a tumor forms in the brain. The tumor forms over the brain, but not over the lung.
This tumor forms when the lung cancer is present. The tissue inside the tumor is exposed to the air, and the lung is not producing the lung tumor. The cancer is a very rare form of lung cancer that can be diagnosed by the standard of care.
There are many ways to diagnose lung cancer:
The first way is to look for the tumor, and then look

Expected Response: yes. the brain is one of several metastatic sites for lung cancer.

Question: after starting concerta how long should it take before we start seeing improvements in my child’s behavior?
Baseline Response: it depends. If your child is learning, you can wait a little longer and see if they start to enjoy it. If they start not to enjoy, then you can make sure that they are learning something new. If their behavior is not being improved, then they can start to be more curious about the music or games they are playing. If you try to change their behavior, it will not help, but it can help them improve it.
’’
I am a musician and I have played with a lot of different instruments. I am sure that my children are going to enjoy what they are doing. In order to make sure their behavior improves, you have to see that they like the music better. If that is not possible, then it is best to try to get their attention in order to get better performance.
I would recommend that

Expected Response: you should start seeing improvements almost immediately within the first few days of use. however you may not see complete improvement for up to one month. if you do not see any improvement within the first month of treatment you should speak to your child’s healthcare provider to re-evaluate how to treat the condition.

Question: why is my birth control causing me acne? . i started getting bad acne on my last bc i asked to be switched to ocella. i have never had acne i was on something similiar to ortho tri cyclen. its been almost a full two packs and i dont notice much of a difference everytime i think its getting better i seem to get 3 or 4 new pimples in the same spots. i now have scarring all over my cheeks it makes me cry looking in the mirror and im just not sure what to do. these a deep cystic pimples that hurt then on my chin.
Baseline Response: i have had acne on some of my skin but it didnt cause any pimple or burn on me. i started using it once and it didnt hurt. i went to my doctor and he said im not sure why i was getting bad. i asked him to tell me why and he told me i was not good. he said it was because i had

Expected Response: i would talk to my doctor about: 1 - if this is a short term side effect that over time will get better or 2 - if you can switch and try something else don't just suffer - if you have the right doctor they will work with you on this. i really hope you feel better and find something that works for you. there are more options than ever these days.

Question: what if your appendix is hurting for 4 days without seeing a doctor? . it hurts when i cough and sneeze and barely keep anything down
Baseline Response: you can go to a doctor and get a blood test and you'll find that the appendix is the reason why you need to stop using a medication.
Solution: if you want to stop taking medication, you can get a prescription from the doctor.
A note to self-care and care
I have been on a lot of medications for a long time and it is very difficult to get the right dose of medication. I have to take the medication myself because I have diabetes and I get an increase in blood sugar and I'm on a diet. I do not want to have to go through this again. It is not good for my health and I am not going to be able to eat healthy food. I don't want to go to the doctor for blood tests and blood work because I am tired and I want to

Expected Response: sorry to hear you're suffering through this. i think it's probably time for you to seek medical attention. the thing is. it could be your appendix. or it could be something else entirely. if it is your appendix and it's inflamed (swollen or possibly infected) it probably won't get better on its own. but then again it may not be your appendix at all. could be your gallbladder. or a hernia. the only way to tell for sure is to get a physical examination. if you're running a fever along with these other symptoms you need to see a doctor as soon as possible. think urgent care or emergency room. if you're not running a fever you might be safe to wait for an appointment with your primary care provider if you can get in within the next couple of days. feel better soon!

Question: i just started working out and while doing abs i have an extremely bad pain in the lower right section is this bad?
Baseline Response: This is a common issue. I have never been able to get back to normal and I have to do more than my exercises to fix it.
I have tried some different exercises to help me get back on my feet and in the gym.
When I tried this exercise it was amazing. I felt more like a man and felt like I could walk in my shoes. I was able to walk in the shoes and I feel like I am walking in the right way. I am now a man!
I am a huge fan of sports and I am not a big fan of the physical activity. I try to get my body back in shape and I do a lot of physical activity to get me back on the right track.
This exercise helped me a lot. It made me feel like my muscles were stronger and I was more comfortable in my

Expected Response: whenever a person begins an exercise program it's important they have been cleared by their primary health care provider to do so and also that they learn to perform exercises using correct form. incorrect form can cause serious injury. the pain you experienced in your abdomen while doing an ab workout could be a result of something simple (like a strained muscle) or something more serious (like a hernia). if the pain doesn't clear up or if it gets worse or if you feel a bulge in your groin area or if you develop a fever over 101f you should seek medical attention. on the other hand if the pain was momentary and you haven't had any problems since the incident then you may be safe to take a wait-and-see attitude about this. hope this helps!

Question: no period symptoms but negative results? . my most fertile days were charted as oct 25th thru the 29th. i had sex on the 18th 25th and 26th. my period was to be expected on the 10th of november here we are on the 12th and still i haven't had any period symptoms. i took two home pregnancy test one before my missed period and one after they both were negative. is there a chance i could still be pregnant? is there any chance my hcg is still low? i'm confused and frustrated i need to know.
Baseline Response: no, i can't get pregnant because my uterus is full. I'm not a risk taker and i'm not worried about pregnancy. I am in no way at risk for pregnancy.

Expected Response: hi your hcg will only rise after implantation has happened so that's that one out of the way. the reason for no period symptoms could its just a skipped period it happens to lots of women sometimes at the wrong time as with you now. one more out of the way. if your cycle is a 28 day cycle so day one first day of your period? yes ok then day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day now you need to have unprotected sex 4 days before this reason it takes sperm 3 days to reach your womb and can live the for 5 7 or 10 days max this means its sitting there just waiting for you egg. get this working you should get pregnant but no matter what length your period is its always day 14. hope this helps you. good luck
================================================================================
Question: what is an ectopic or tubal pregnancy?
Baseline Response: This is the most common form of ectopic pregnancy. It is the result of a fertilized egg fertilization or fertilization of an egg. In most cases, a fertilization is performed when the egg is fertilized by a sperm that has been implanted within the egg.
In some cases, ectopic pregnancies are caused by the birth of a single fertilized embryo, a single egg, or a single ectopic egg. If a fertilizing embryo is not fertilized, the fertilization does not occur. The term ectopic refers to a pregnancy that occurs in the same way as an ectopy.
There are many different types of ectopy (polycystic ovary syndrome), so it is important to remember that there are different kinds of ectoparasies.
What are ectopic fertilization procedures?
A fertilized ectopy is a pregnancy where the egg becomes fertilized within the uterus and

Expected Response: an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus often in the fallopian tubes.
================================================================================
Question: how long can the flu live in your home. my son has the flu how long until it is safe for my other children and grandchildren to come into my home?
Baseline Response: this is a very important question. As soon as you get your child into your home, you will be able to get the flu. This is a common problem for many parents. If you are having a home emergency, the flu will be most likely to be in your family.
How long will the flu stay in your house? How long will it last in your body?
The flu can stay in the body for a long time. The body is able to absorb the flu from the blood and the blood can survive. The flu can be a long-lasting disease. The most common symptoms of the flu are fever, cough, and sore throat.
Will the flu spread to my children?
Yes, the vaccine protects the body from the flu virus. The vaccine is the best way to protect

Expected Response: because people with the flu are contagious while they are ill and that they tend to be most contagious while they have a fever cdc advises people who are sick with flu to stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until after their fever is gone (without the use of fever-reducing medicines). if a sick person is around others we advise that they cover their cough and everyone washes their hands frequently. most flu is spread directly from a sick person to another person. while flu viruses can be spread by surfaces contaminated with flu viruses (such as by coughing on them) this is probably not a very efficient way to spread the virus. studies have shown that human influenza viruses generally can survive on surfaces between 2 and 8 hours in usual conditions.

Question: my grandson has had headaches and also running fever with it for over a month now not understanding why. any opinions
Baseline Response: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand why the headache is happening. I know it is something that you have to do to get the headaches. I am just wondering if you have any advice on how to handle this.

Expected Response: i am very sorry but we do not know anything about your grandson. not even his age. headaches and fever are very non-specific symptoms and could be signs of hundreds if not thousands of different medical problems. if he has not been carefully examined this would be your first step. he needs a diagnostic work-up.

Question: menopause or pregnant? . i am a 46 year old female and i have been using contraceptives for almost 20+ years and this is the first time i have missed my menstrual cycle. i am late for 4 days now. i feel like bloated and all the symptoms of the start of your cycle is what i am feeling now but not sure if i need to wait couple more days before i bought a home pregnancy test but i know my body and before that my partner and i did not have any intercourse 3 weeks before my cycle. please help.
Baseline Response: i have always wanted to try a pregnancy test and i was not happy with my results but i knew i needed help and i started the test. i have 3 kids and i need help and you can help me.
I am 44 and i am pregnant and i feel sick and tired. I feel like I am on my own. i need some help to get me through my pregnancy. i had a miscarriage a month ago

Expected Response: if you have a "normal" 28 day cycle ovulation would be around day 14. your most fertile days would be days 10 to 17. three weeks before your period was due would be day 7 which would be a bit too early as sperm live a maximum of 5 days. they'd probably be dead before you ovulated.
================================================================================
Question: sshould i put toothpaste on a boil?
Baseline Response: Yes, this is not a problem. If you put the toothpaste in a pot, it will boil in the water. It will also give you a better taste. The only problem is that the toothpastes you use will not taste as good as the toothpicks that you get with a regular toothbrush. This is because the toothpick is so small.
If you are using toothpaste, use it in a small container. In this case, you will use a small spoon.
You will not get any flavor or smell from the toothbrush or toothpaste.
The taste is not good.
When using toothpastives, be sure to use the right amount of toothpaste every time.
Do not use toothpaste with a lot of water.
Use toothpaste that is not as heavy as the one you use.
Avoid using toothpies that are too heavy for your taste.

Expected Response: only if the boil had teeth. use hot compresses but if the boil is getting worse see your medical provider so it can be properly treated. treatment may include lancing the boil to relieve the pus and/or antibiotics.

Question: ok im gaining weight like im pregnant pregnancy test coming up positive but had a sonogram done an no baby what is it. my boobs also hurt i have all the signs of being pregant but i also want to be pregnant verybadly what could be goin on
Baseline Response: i have no idea but i'm pretty sure it would cause me to feel as if i have a miscarriage. I do believe that there is a pregnancy test in my blood and that it would test for pregnancy. I was a little worried about this, but it is something that is not really discussed. I also don't think it would be a problem if I had a miscarriage and I was having a baby. I have a question for you: what is the difference between a pregnancy and a miscarriage? Are there any medical questions that need to be answered before you can get pregnant?
Answer - I would like to ask you a few questions before I get pregnant. First, how did you get pregnant

Expected Response: i think this is something you should discuss with your gynecologist. it's possible you're experiencing a false pregnancy (the medical term is pseudocyesis) but the fact your home pregnancy test returned a positive result concerns me. there are a few rare cancers that can mimic the symptoms of pregnancy and you should ask to have those ruled out. you might also consider making an appointment with a counselor to discuss your situation. a counselor can help you cope with feelings of disappointment from not being pregnant when you so badly want to be and also can help you understand why your mind might be causing your body to exhibit the symptoms of pregnancy when you're not pregnant. wishing you all the best!
================================================================================
Question: can you become pregnant from being fingered if the fingers have wiped off?
Baseline Response: Yes, we can. But we have to be careful about our fingering. If you have a problem with the fingers, you can go to the doctor and get a blood test. If it doesn't work, you have to get some other method to get a pregnancy test.
"You don't want to do anything that could have an impact on the quality of your pregnancy."
A woman who has been fingered in the past may have had an adverse reaction to the procedure.
The National Gestation Report says that only 1 in 4 women has ever had a finger removed.
But the British Society of Gestation Practitioners has said that "pre-operative surgery is no longer an option" for many women.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The National Gested Pregnancy Report says some women have been subjected to the same type of finger-scratch procedure as others

Expected Response: hi if they were dried when wiped then you should be ok if they were still we with sperm then there is always a chance if this was within the last 72 hours and your worried then you can take a plan b the morning after pill. hope this helps. good luck

Question: painful mole or skin tag burns constantly. a few years ago i noticed a small bump under my left armpit. at first it never bothered me and i thought it was going to turn into a skin tag but it never has. it is like a small plateau shaped mole that is about the same color as my skin. it constantly has a throbbing burning sensation to it and sometimes stings like being stung or poked with a needle. it is more irritating than anything and i was just wondering what it could be?
Baseline Response: it is a skin bug that causes it to get stuck in my skin and it is not easily removed.
Answer 2: it's a skin problem that needs to be fixed.
Solution:
1) If you have any questions or need help, you can always ask my team at gmail at gb.com and i will help you out.
2) If i have any other questions, please let me know and i can help

Expected Response: i would be wondering as well but you cannot make an important diagnostic call based solely on a brief description. any skin lesion that is painful or changing deserves to have a professional look at it first-hand. if the dermatologist is not sure (not all skin lesions can be identified by appearance alone) then it may be recommended to have it surgically removed. you would then have a "cure" (since it would be gone) and a pathological diagnosis -- the most accurate.

Question: should i be concerned my 6 year old has had 3 nose bleeds in the past 24 hours? . it seems to be when he is hit in the head not hard just like playing with other kids ruff housing. it seems to be anywhere on his head not his face.
Baseline Response: no
Answer 2: is it possible for a 6 year olds to have a head bleed and still have 3 nose bleed?
Answer 3: does this mean he has 3 nose bents?

Expected Response: if the bleeding was from the same side of the nose you may be experiening one nose bleed that has recurred three times. this happens when the scab that forms either fails to adhere to the slippery mucous lining and bleeds again or a probing finger dislodges it. as long as your child is not bruised in other areas or anemic nose bleeds are often more annoying than serious. you do need to know the proper way of controlling the bleeding so check on the webmd site for "nosebleeds" and you will find some helpful information. with that said. i am a bit concerned about the head injury. since i have no way to take a more thorough medical history or examine him this should be address with his medical provider. he doesn't have a head injury it was more for a "bump" than a "hit".
================================================================================
Question: how often can albuterol be used
Baseline Response: Yes, it is used in many medications, especially in acne. It is also used in topical creams. It can also be used in cosmetic products. It has been shown to have a protective effect against rashes.
It is important to know that it is very important to note that it does not cause acne. However, it has been found to be safe for people with acne.
How is albuterate used?
Albuterate is used to treat acne. In this way, it can be used as a preventive measure against acne. The main benefit of albutate is that it can help prevent the spread of acne. Albuterate has been used to prevent the formation of acne lesions.

================================================================================
Question: how do i treat a pulled calf muscle? . if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury.
Baseline Response: the calf muscle is not soft and it is not painful. It is a hard, resilient muscle that can be used for many purposes.
The reason you should do this is because of the fact that the calf is hard and it may be difficult to remove. The calf can be removed with a small piece of cloth, or a knife or scissors.
There is a good chance that the pulled calf will not heal completely. But if the calf has a lot of blood and the tendon is still strong, you should remove it and re-attach it to the calf.
I have seen this done in my own practice. It has worked very well. It does not hurt like pulling the calf and I would like to see more of it done.
If the calf isn't strong enough to take

Expected Response: if it’s mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury. painful calf muscle strains deserve “price” therapy (see below) and complete calf muscle tears (which are rare) may need surgical repair. the vast majority of pulled calf muscles will heal completely within a few weeks without any treatment. pulled muscles are also called muscle strains. they occur when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their normal length. the injury creates tears in the muscle that are usually tiny (microtears). in the most severe calf muscle strains the entire muscle is torn causing significant swelling and pain. the calf muscle (also called the gastrocnemius) is a commonly injured muscle. a pulled calf muscle most often occurs after vigorous activity (running jumping climbing stairs) but can happen with normal activity in middle-aged and elderly people. pain possibly with some swelling or bruising is the main symptom of a calf muscle strain. immediately after a pulled calf muscle using “price” therapy may help speed healing: p for protect from re-injury r for rest i for immobilize with tape or an athletic bandage wrap c for compression (make that wrap tight but not so tight your leg goes numb) e for elevate (keeping your calf muscle above your heart may reduce swelling) price actually stands for prevention rest ice compression evaluate elevate*** i had the same thing happen to me. you need to go to a sports medicine doctor and get an x-ray of you ankle. it might sound crazy but there is a possibility that you broke your tibia in your ankle. when you break your tibia your calf hurts then your ankle starts to hurt. i had this happen and i went to my physician and they said it was a mild sprang so i walked around for a month with a broken ankle and i just found out three weeks ago and i am still in a cast.

Question: what causes back pain on the right side just below rib cage? . i had run a low grade fever and chills for two evenings with no other symptoms then i started with a pain in my middle right side of my back it hurts real bad a while and then feels better and then hurts again.
Baseline Response: - it is a result of the very cold and cold weather.
i can see it in my eyes but i can't feel it.
I feel very ill.
It seems that my back is very cold, it is almost impossible to tell if i am sick or not.
There is no way to tell.
My back is not good.

Question: been on birth control for four months showing signs of being pregnant. could i be pregnant? . i had my daughter four months old been on birth control after i had her. i was on the nuva ring and bleed the straight two months i was on it then my ob/gyn switched me the pill with no interuptions and i am still bleeding. its been kind light so i have had unprotected sex this whole time except for the weeks i was on my suppose to be regular period. i am now showing some symptoms of being pregnant. two home test showed up negative but is there a possibility i could still be pregnant?
Baseline Response: i am on the right side of the ovary. i have been on my own for two weeks. i feel pretty good and i can get it back on after about a month. the last two days i had a mild miscarriage, and i was really surprised. i don't know if i will ever feel better again. i will probably try

Expected Response: hi thanks for the query. as you delivered 4 months back i am thinking that possibly you are lactating the baby. in that case your doctor might have prescribed progesterone hormonal pills to you. if you use progesterone pills as per the guidelines the possibility of pregnancy is less. but if you missed the time of intake the possibility of pregnancy is there. for more details : <link> symptoms you mentioned could be due to the side effects of the pills also. once go for urine pregnancy test to clarity the doubts. take care.

Question: what are the best types of diet foods to snack on?
Baseline Response: you can't just eat junk food.
This article is about the type of diet food to eat.
It's not about the diet food, it's about the food you eat. I mean, it should be as healthy as possible. I just like to eat it as much as I can without any problem.
I am always trying to make sure that I'm eating a diet that I understand and that it works for me. I'm not going to go out and eat a bunch of junk food and then go to a bar of soda and eat some junk food, because I'm going to get all of that junk food for a certain amount of time.
The key here is to eat something that works for you. This is about how much you can eat. If you can, then that is what you're going to do.
That's where this article comes in.
My advice to

Expected Response: the best types of diet foods to snack on are high in water and fiber content such as vegetables. add a protein source to your snacks such as fat-free milk or yogurt to help you feel fuller longer.

Question: my 15 year old son is the size of an 8 year old and hasnt grown in 5 years. what could be causing this?
Baseline Response: my son has a big head. he has a huge face, but he has no nose. his nose is big.
Answer 3:
Answer 4:
I think my son is an adult, but I'm not sure. I think my baby is a little older. I'm sure my child is a bit older.
Solution:
You can try a little more, but your child may not grow as quickly as your son.
The question should be answered if your child is 5 years old or younger.
If your child grows up to be an adult at 5 years of age, then your child's face is small and will not grow.
In my experience, the bigger the child's head, the smaller his body is.
You have to be careful about your child growing up to grow up to have a

Expected Response: it could be genetic if his parents are small or he could have a growth hormone deficiency. the sooner the gets evaluated the better. get his in to see a pediatric endocrinologist asap since he is 15 now. growth hormone deficiencies must be treated before his growth plates close (while he is still growing).

Question: hi im only 14 and i have a sore throat and ive been shaking a lot and slight feaver and a headache what could it be?
Baseline Response: i am a 14 year old who has had two or three seizures. ive had two separate ones in my lifetime and was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy. ix
I'm a 15 year old and i am having a lot of problems and have been in pain for some time. imex is the only one who has taken any medication that has helped me. iong is a 14 yr old who is having seizures.
I am a 13 year old girl with a small boy who has been in seizures for about 3 weeks. ilex is a 15 yr old boy who is experiencing severe fevers. ibit is a 12 year old boy with a mild seizure and I have been feeling better for a few weeks.
i am 21 years old and have a serious illness and a high fever.

Expected Response: if you are shaking and having a headache along with your sore throat you need to see a doctor to look at you immediately. most sore throats are caused by infections but some infections are more serious than others. a doctor can test your throat to see if you have strep throat or something serious. go to the doctor right away.
================================================================================
Question: my mom has intestinal worms and has tried several home remedies. now she is experiencing some pain. what can she do?
Baseline Response: she can get up to speed on food and drink. she can read books and watch movies. she has a book called "The Healing Factor" that helps her with her symptoms. she is working on a book on eating healthy and having a healthy lifestyle. she just has to get up and get some food. she needs to get some vitamins and minerals in order to get her body to work. she also needs to use her natural natural food to help her balance. she will need to have a diet that is low in carbohydrates, high in protein and low in fats.

Expected Response: to eradicate intestinal worms you need a prescription medication based on the type of worm or parasite. this really needs to be checked out by a physician. there are specific lab tests that need to be done to make sure she is infected. there is not a product found over-the-counter that will treat worms or parasites. so be sure to work closely with her health care provider. .

Question: i had a cbc yesterday. i'm 58 f. not feeling well for the past 5 months. my hemoglobin was:7. 8. my hematocrit 28. 3. i would like to know if you consider this "severe". the dr. found a soft tissue mass in my upper middle abdomen. he's sending me to have ct scan of my abdomen with contrast. he's thinking some bleeding might be going on there. if so he has a surgeon picked out to do the surgery within a few weeks. i just want to know all the information i can so i can get to feeling better down the road! . many thanks/debbie feighner/fort wayne in
Baseline Response: I have been looking for a doctor in the area for the last few months. i am currently in my second year of high school. i have been following the medical community for a few months now and am now getting more and more information from the doctors and nurses

Expected Response: i know you are worried debbie (please do not use your name in these postings or they may be deleted) and your doctor is wise to search for the many reasons for your anemia and finding what that abdominal mass might be is high on the list. the ct is a very accurate test so you will know more information once the scan has been read. obviously a cancer would be something to consider but not all abdominal masses are cancerous. if you are also having obvious or occult (hidden) rectal bleeding (detected on those stool tests) then this could be the source of your anemia but remember there are many different types of anemia. not just anemia from blood loss. your anemia is considered severe in my opinion so all efforts should be done to find the reason(s). if the ct shows that your mass is "suspicious" then the surgeon will take over your case.
================================================================================
Question: where do i start if i have never exercised?
Baseline Response: the first question is how do i know if i should be doing it? The answer to this is: it depends.
If you do it right, you will know that you are doing it right. If you don't, then you are not doing it properly.
The second question is what to do if i am not doing something.
This is the question about what is the correct way to do it.
There is no question that you should do something. There is no problem.
It is a matter of knowing what you are trying to do.
What you are saying is that you can do it in any order. You can do anything.
And the more you know this, the more likely you are to be successful.
You should do it this way.
In fact, if you do this way, you can be successful if you have never done it before.
That is,

Expected Response: if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park farther away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. whichever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals: write down what activity you plan to do on what day of the week for how long and at what time of day. be as specific and realistic as possible. for instance write down "tuesday: walk for 20 minutes at 7 p. m. to the park and back. " at the end of each week review your goals and set new ones for the upcoming week. research shows that setting goals will help you stick to your program. it will clarify what you're supposed to do and let you track your progress. if you hit a roadblock later on you can refer back to what has worked in the past or use your accomplishments to re-energize yourself.

Question: what is colorectal cancer?
Baseline Response: colorexal cancer is a cancer of the rectum. It is an abnormal form of the colon that can be treated with antibiotics.

Expected Response: colorectal cancer happens when cells that are not normal grow in your colon or rectum. these cells grow together and form tumors. this cancer is also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. colon and rectal cancers often return months or years after treatment. this is called recurrent cancer. if the original cancer was removed before it was able to spread the chances that it will return are lower. metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. when colon or rectal cancer spreads it most often spreads to the liver. sometimes it spreads to the lungs bones or brain. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: husband's acl and meniscus in right knee are tore. i need some ab exercises he can do without moving his legs please. he is in the military and will have to continue doing pt which includes sit-ups pushups and running after the surgery and recovery. he needs some exercises he can do before and after the surgery to keep his abs as well as arm strength up.
Baseline Response: wife is in a wheelchair and he needs to do a lot of work before she can move.

Expected Response: the first thing to do is to make sure that your husband has medical clearance for exercise before initiating a program after surgery or during his recovery. your husband’s doctor or physical therapist should be able to provide example exercises but ace fitness also has a pretty comprehensive exercise library with a wide assortment of exercises as well. my recommended course of action would be to print out some of these exercises that seem tolerable to him and show them to his doctor or physical therapist to gain his or her approval on those specific exercises. practice caution when initiating an exercise routine so that your husband doesn’t aggravate his current condition or cause further injury. slow and gradual progression might be best. visit the ace exercise library located here: <link>

Question: what surgery options do i have for genital herpes?
Baseline Response: I have no idea. I have had no surgery in the past, but I would do it if I could.
I have been diagnosed with genital herpes in 2008. I had been in a relationship for about 3 years with my partner for whom I had a very long term relationship. I was having a difficult time controlling my sexuality and felt that I had to keep my sexuality separate from my partner. I also felt like I was not getting the care I wanted. I could not be myself in a healthy relationship and I needed help. I knew that I was going to be in a bad relationship with my partners for a very very long time, and I would have to go through the same things that I did with my past partners. I would feel like I had no control over my sexuality.
How do you feel about your partner having genital herpes and how can they help you?
What I would like to do is

Expected Response: there is no need for surgical treatment for genital herpes. but if you are pregnant and genital herpes is diagnosed or suspected at the time of labor and delivery a cesarean section (surgical) delivery may be recommended to protect the baby from getting a herpes simplex infection which can cause serious health problems. a mother can pass the herpes simplex virus (hsv) to her baby if she has a sore or blister present during a vaginal delivery. the biggest risk occurs during a first-time (primary) outbreak of genital herpes. usually in these cases the woman either does not have symptoms or is unaware of symptoms. experts disagree about the use of cesarean section delivery in women with recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes. if a pregnant woman has recurrent outbreaks the risk of passing the virus to her baby is less than 1% because the baby has some immune protection from the mother. 1 cesarean section may be recommended if a woman has symptoms such as tingling or pain (prodromal symptoms) that signal an impending outbreak. for these women acyclovir ( zovirax ) used in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy may reduce the need for delivery by cesarean section by reducing the risk of a recurrent outbreak at the time of delivery. a cesarean section is usually not done if a woman with recurrent genital herpes has blisters or sores only on her thighs buttocks or another area that is not close to the vagina. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what are some other possible early side effects from radiation therapy besides fatigue skin problems and hair loss?
Baseline Response: it depends on the dose. If you are at high risk for radiation problems you may not need radiation therapy.
If you have a high risk of radiation problems then you may need radiation treatment.
What is the best way to do radiation therapy?
The best way is to take a radiation dose and take a daily dose of radiation.
The radiation dose is a mixture of the dose you take and the dose that you take.
You can take either a dose of the same dose or a daily dosage.
How do I determine the dose of my radiation dose?
You should take your dose as soon as possible.
When you take your radiation dose you should take the following steps:
1. Follow the instructions on your prescription medicine label.
2. Follow all of the directions.
3. Take your dose at the time you are most likely to need

Expected Response: other early side effects are usually specific to the site that receives the radiation. eating problems radiation therapy to the head neck or parts of the digestive system can result in loss of interest in eating. but it's important to continue to eat a healthy diet while undergoing treatment in order to maintain your health and keep up your strength. eating five or six small meals spread out through the day often works better than trying to eat three larger meals. trying new recipes can help you maintain your interest in eating. keeping healthy snacks that you enjoy on hand will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and perhaps losing your appetite. mouth problems before you start radiation to the head or neck see your dentist for a thorough exam to help reduce subsequent problems once therapy starts. radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: sores lack of saliva thickened saliva difficulty swallowing jaw stiffness. it's important to tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help reduce the discomfort you feel. to help manage these side effects: avoid spicy and acidic foods. don't smoke chew tobacco or drink alcohol. brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. hearing problems radiation therapy to the head can cause hearing difficulties. one possible cause is hardening of the wax in your ears caused by radiation. let your doctor know if you have difficulty hearing. nausea radiation to the head neck and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. let your doctor know if that occurs because there are medicines you can use to help control nausea. also the doctor or the nurse can help you learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. diarrhea radiation therapy to the stomach or abdomen can cause diarrhea which typically starts a few weeks after starting the therapy. the doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control the diarrhea as well as suggest changes in your diet such as eating frequent small meals avoiding high-fiber foods and being sure to get enough potassium. fertility and sexual issues radiation therapy in the region of the pelvis can affect your fertility and your sex drive. it's also important not to try to become pregnant during radiation therapy because radiation can hurt the fetus. radiation therapy of the pelvic region can cause women to stop having menstrual periods and to experience other symptoms of menopause. it's important to talk with your doctor about what kind of effect radiation might have on your ability to have children in the future. in men radiation in an area that includes the testes can affect the sperm count as well as the functionality of the sperm. this doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. but if you want to have children later you should talk with your doctor about considering the use of a sperm bank before treatment begins. treatment to the pelvis can cause sexual intercourse to be painful for some women and can also cause scarring that affects the ability of the vagina to stretch. in men radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that make an erection possible. you should discuss your concerns with your doctor before treatment begins to learn about your options and possible outcomes. it's natural to have less interest in sex when undergoing treatment for cancer. but typically your sex drive will reawaken after treatment stops. talk with your spouse and share your concerns about the need for being close.

Question: how can computers affect my child’s sleep?
Baseline Response: computers can help your child sleep better. But they also help your children sleep better because you're able to read their thoughts. This is true even when you're not talking to your child.
How does computer sleep affect your child?
Computer sleep has several important effects:
It helps you remember your thoughts.
It gives your child the ability to think clearly.
You can help them to think more clearly. Computer sleep can help you remember a great deal about what you are thinking.
Computer Sleep is good for your child's health.
And it helps your child to make better decisions.
So, you can do some of the things you can to help your kid get better sleep.
But how do you do it?
I'm not going to go into the details of how to do it, but it's a good idea.
First, make sure you have your child read at least

Expected Response: you should probably be looking at what your children are looking at on the internet anyway whether it’s video games or things of that nature. just sitting in front of a screen and the light that is produced from that screen actually has been shown in one japanese study to affect the child’s circadian rhythm. in what way? well what it can do is it can actually throw off the circadian rhythm. they found with laptop computers with both adults and i want to say it was high school age kids that they found that it actually made them stay awake because light in front of them doesn’t produce the melatonin during that portion of the night. i usually recommend parents to have times for the tv times for the computer and not to go past those times and to really limit that access.

Question: can one refuse psych treatments under obamacare based on religious preference?
Baseline Response: no. It's a religious right issue. We are not trying to deny religious rights or deny religious liberty.
I've heard many people say that they want to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.
Yes, there are a lot of people who want to deny access to health care to non-Muslims.
We don't want to make those decisions based on the religious beliefs of our members.
But it's very important to have a conversation about what the rights and responsibilities of people are.
For example, what is the right to practice religion?
It's a right that has been denied to me and my family for many years.
It is an important right.
A lot of what we're doing here is based on what is legal in the United Kingdom.
So, I think the United Nations should take a look at what is happening here in the UK, and if

Expected Response: most helpful answer i'm not sure i fully understand the question but let me try to cover as many bases as possible. certainly you won't be required to undergo any psychological treatments as a result of the law. unless treatment is court ordered you always have the right to refuse it. if what you're asking is whether you can buy a health plan that does not pay for mental health and substance abuse services the answer is no. there are religious exemptions under the law that would allow you -- if you meet criteria -- to avoid having to buy insurance at all. but there is no way for you to buy an insurance policy and pick and choose the specific benefits that come with it based on your personal belief system.

It is most common in women, but it can also occur in men.
When you are infected with GBS, you are usually infected with a type of bacteria called Streptococcus (Coccyx bovis).

================================================================================
Question: does lipitor increase your blood sugar?
Baseline Response: Yes.
Studies have shown that lipitor can increase the level of insulin, which in turn increases the amount of insulin you get.
How much insulin is needed to produce a rise in blood sugar is dependent on the amount and type of insulin your body is receiving.
You can see in this chart that insulin levels increase with weight, which is the amount that your body uses to produce insulin.
So if you are 6'6" and weigh 180lbs and have a normal blood sugar of 30-40mg/dL, you would need to produce 3,200 IU of insulin a day. That's about 4.5 times more insulin than you would get in your normal weight body.
If you have an increased risk of diabetes and are on a low glycemic index diet, you may need to add a bit more insulin to your diet.
Now, I'm not saying that lipitors are bad for you.

Expected Response: while there is some evidence that the statin medications can affect blood sugar the benefits of the medications usually outweigh the risks. the effect on blood sugar is minimal. if you are concerned about your blood sugar or the medications you are taking you should talk to your health-care professional.

Question: what is the difference between osteoporosis and scoliosis?
Baseline Response: osteoporexia is an inflammatory condition caused by a breakdown of bone, causing inflammation of the bone walls and the skin. It is caused by changes in the calcium and phosphate levels in the bone and is caused at a rate of up to 5% per year.
There are several different types of osteoporsia. One type of osteosis is a fracture of the skin, called a scolosis. The main reason for this is that the skin is too soft and the bone is too thick. It's difficult to see the difference in the skin with the right amount of light. The other type of scolism is a scid fracture of skin, a scorosis. It occurs when the skin gets too soft or too thick and the tissue around it becomes more brittle.
Osteoporiasis is a type of skin disorder that is caused when the bones of the body become

Question: what is a more judicious use of antibiotics?
Baseline Response: Asteroid drugs are sometimes used for the treatment of infections that are caused by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. The drug is given to prevent the growth of bacteria in the body. The bacteria are then removed from the body by the injection of a antibiotic. This method of medicine is sometimes called "surgical antibiotic."
A few antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria in your body. These include:
Antibiotic-tolerant drugs, such as antibiotic-treated streptomycin, antibiotic-tolerance drugs (TREPs), and antibiotics that are not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Antihistamines, such, as clindamycin and methotrexate, are often prescribed for the prevention of infections caused when the bacterial body is exposed to an organism.
Treatment of bacterial infections caused to the body is

Question: my 14 year old niece has a milky discharge coming from her breast what can be the cause for this if not pregnant?
Baseline Response: it's a combination of breast cancer and an infection.
This is a common problem in the milky milky milk and it can be very painful.
I don't know why this happens, but it happens in a lot of cases.
Here's how it works:
1) You begin to develop a breast cancer. You may have a mild to moderate infection and a few benign symptoms like a rash, tingling, pain, or swelling.
2) Your breasts may become very swollen, but if they don't, your breast cancer will continue to spread.
3) You may not be able to tell the difference between a normal breast cancer or breast cancer that is very normal and a breast tumor that is an infection and that is not an infection, but you may see symptoms of the disease.
4) You might

Expected Response: this is a great question. thanks for asking! in general i always suggest women of any age make an appointment with their primary health care provider if they experience nipple discharge of any kind. nipple discharge is not necessarily abnormal and doesn't mean you have breast cancer. but because nipple discharge can be caused by a few scary conditions it's usually best to have it checked out by a professional. i hope this helps!

Baseline Response: yes. This is a common problem for the claritins. They are not very effective as a stabilizer. You can also try a little bit of acetone in the clarins. This helps them stay on their own and not interfere with the natural structure of the clarin. It is also a good idea to use a small amount of the acetone to keep the clarinant in balance.
Answer 1: can you give my claritino, claritina, clarinum (generic) with a mild cold/sinsus? I have tried this before, but it seems to work much better than the clarinet version.
I have tried the clarini clarinino (generic), clarinu, claril and clarinosa (generic). The results are very good. The clarinet

Expected Response: tylenol cold products usually contain an antihistamine called chlorpheniramine which is an older version of the type of ingredient found in claritin. they both are antihistamines. since both contain antihistamines it is not recommended to use them at the same time. this could increase the risk of side effects. you should always check to see which ingredients are in the product you are choosing so as to be sure you are not giving your child too much of one type of ingredient which commonly happens when you combine combination products. always check with your pharmacist before taking over-the-counter products; he or she can help you choose the right products for your symptoms and help you avoid dangerous overdoses and interactions.

Question: does osteoarthritis cause a higher white blood count
Baseline Response: osteoarthropathy is a disease of the white blood cells. It is a condition where white blood cell damage causes a red blood cell to invade the body and cause a blood clot that is a problem in the body.
The white blood is the most important organ in the world. We are all affected by white blood clots. The most common cause of white blood loss is a heart attack. When the white cells of the heart invade the bloodstream and cause white blood clotting, they cause the white cell to become enlarged. The white blood also contains the cells that make up the white matter.
There is no cure for osteoarticular disease, but a group of physicians from around the world have developed a method to reduce the risk of white cell damage by reducing the amount of white cells in the white system. The solution is to reduce white blood flow and to remove white cells from the white body.

Expected Response: not really. if you have infection then only the white blood count goes up. osteoarthritis is not an infectious disease.

Question: what causes aortic aneurysms aside from arteriosclerosis?
Baseline Response: the arteriosclerotic pressure increases when you are too old for exercise, and that's the cause of aneurism. Aneurysm is the most common cause of death in older people, and it's probably one of the more common causes of sudden death.

If you have any of the following conditions:
You have a heart condition, such as heart disease
You are on medication to help prevent heart disease, such, as insulin
You're on medication for diabetes
You don't have diabetes
The doctor may recommend that you do a heart scan to see if you have a condition known as aneurylosis (a condition where the heart's blood vessels are blocked). If it's not clear, you can make a referral to a local cardiologist.
When you have aneurymias, your heart attacks may be triggered by a

Expected Response: the most common cause of aortic aneurysms is hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) but other causes include: genetic/hereditary: there is a familial tendency to developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. peoplewith first-degree relatives (brothers sisters or parents) having abdominal aortic aneurysms have a higher risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysm than the general population. they also tend to develop the aneurysms at younger ages and have a higher tendency to suffer aneurysm rupture than individuals without family history. genetic disease: there are also rare inheritable genetic diseases of connective tissue (tissue that make up the wall of the aorta) such as ehlers-danlos syndrome and marfan's syndrome that can lead to the development of aortic aneurysms. posttrauma: after physical trauma to the aorta. arteritis: inflammation of blood vessels as occurs in takayasu disease giant cell arteritis and relapsing polychondritis. mycotic (fungal) infection: a mycotic infection may be associated with immunodeficiency iv drug abuse syphilis and heart valve surgery.

Answer to: What would be the average weight of a 55 year old woman to get for a 40 year old man?
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear about your injury. that's no fun! unfortunately there's no straight answer to your question. lifting weights has to do with fitness level not age. i know 55 year old women who can bench press over 100 pounds and i know 30 year old women who can barely lift a 5 pound dumbbell. if the ability to lift up to 50 pounds is a requirement of your job i suggest you ask your doctor about physical therapy to help increase your upper body strength without injuring your back. or after you've been cleared by a doctor to return to normal duty you could consider increasing your fitness level by working out on your own. be sure to start slowly and gradually build up your strength and endurance. webmd has a great exercise workout and fitness center that can help you get started. just remember: always get your doctor's permission before starting any exercise program! hope this helps!

Question: are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when i am pregnant?
Baseline Response: I am not a medical doctor and do not prescribe any herbal products. I am not taking any herbal remedies. I do not take any artificial products.
I have taken herbal medicines for at least three years and have never experienced any side effects. I have not had any adverse effects.
What is the best way to handle herbal remedies?

How long do you think your pregnancy will last?
How can you avoid getting pregnant and having a pregnancy that is not good for you?
Do you have any other questions?
If you are interested in a question, please feel free to email me at [email protected]

Expected Response: except for some vitamins little is known about using dietary supplements while pregnant. some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. but most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. these products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy. in the u. s. there are different laws for medicines and for dietary supplements. the part of the fda that controls dietary supplements is the same part that controls foods sold in the u. s. only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before october 15 1994 submit safety information for review by the fda. however unlike medicines herbal remedies and "natural products" are not approved by the fda for safety or for what they say they will do. most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. before a company can sell a medicine the company must complete many studies and send the results to the fda. many scientists and doctors at the fda check the study results. the fda allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.

Baseline Response: no, i was getting a headache while I was trying to figure out what to do with my energy.
I thought it was just a normal problem with my brain.
So I went to a local ER, the ER had a team of doctors in the room and they told me to get a new energy drink. I was about to go to the ER for a doctor's appointment when I got a text from the ER saying I had an "energy drink" and I was having trouble breathing. I said I was going to get help, and they said that I needed to get an energy drink or I would be in a coma.

Expected Response: it would not be likely to get brain damage from smelling a polyester backpack although i have encountered some deadly tennis shoes from time to time. you are safe.

Question: will losing weight help my urinary incontinence problems?
Baseline Response: yes.
If you are having urinary incondition, it may help to ask your doctor about your weight. If you are not having any urinary incongruence, your doctor will have to examine you for incongreased urinary incandescence. If your doctor does not provide a urine test, you may need to seek medical help.
How many times have you lost weight?
How often do you lose weight? What are your results?
What are your symptoms?
If your symptoms are similar to those seen in your previous year, you should ask your provider about your previous weight loss. If the symptoms are not similar to the ones seen in previous years, you can ask your health care provider about the weight loss you may have experienced in your past year.
Are there any medications you are taking that help you lose some weight? (for example, anti-diuretics, ant

Expected Response: well here's another reason to lose a few. if you are having urinary incontinence problems you may find that losing some weight will make the problems less severe or they may go away altogether. many studies have shown a connection between obesity and urinary incontinence in women especially stress urinary incontinence (you leak when you are coughing laughing or putting physical "stress" on your bladder). excess body weight tends to increase bladder pressure (increased weight on the bladder and pelvis) and may also impair blood flow and nerve impulses to the bladder. studies show a positive correlation between high bmi. and urinary incontinence and the correlation is more pronounced in women than in men. research has also shown that very obese women who undergo extreme weight loss due to gastric surgery see a decrease in their stress urinary incontinence symptoms. in other studies women who achieved a greater than 5% weight loss following weight watchers experienced a greater than 50% reduction in their urinary incontinence symptoms. that means that if you weigh 200 pounds and lose just 11 of them you could reduce your incontinence issues by half! losing weight if you are overweight and maintaining normal weight throughout adulthood may be important approaches to controlling or eliminating urinary incontinence symptoms especially in women.

Question: how can parkinsons disease be prevented?
Baseline Response: as a doctor, I will recommend to you a simple solution to the disease. As a parent, I am very aware of the need for a vaccine to prevent this disease. The solution is to not allow your children to become infected by the diseases that cause the disease (such as measles). However, I cannot recommend to all parents that they should be vaccinated against measles. If you have any questions about this, please feel free to contact me.
The vaccine contains the following ingredients:
-Antibody-1.5 mg of tetracycline (Tetrahydrocannabinol)
-Methylcellulose (Methylcysteine)
Directions for Use:
Take the dose of your vaccine. It is recommended that you take the dose that is most effective for you.
Do not over-dose the vaccine. The dose of the vaccine should be taken at the same time

Expected Response: there is no known way to prevent parkinson's disease. research has shown that people who eat more fruits and vegetables high-fiber foods fish and omega-3 rich oils (sometimes known as the mediterranean diet) and who eat less red meat and dairy may have some protection against parkinson's disease. but the reason for this is still being studied. 4 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

You may also like:
The best way for you to learn how to treat chronic headaches?

Expected Response: unfortunately there have not been any new medications for headache prevention in the last 3 years. there is a treatment (occipital nerve stimulator) that works for chronic daily headaches but it is not yet fda approved for this. the results of a clinical trial of this should be published later this year or early next year. as far as diagnosis goes there still is no way to find the cause of daily headaches if the mri scan of the brain is normal. there are some patients with neck problems that have daily headaches so i usually recommend having someone evaluate patients for neck problems as well. for treatment we usually try all of the "normal" medications for headache prevention.

Question: what are the symptoms of gastroenteritis?
Baseline Response: The symptoms of food poisoning are caused by the presence of a substance called an antidiuretic, or antifungal agent.

Question: is it unusual if diagnosed with strep throat and yeast infection to be sick/very tired 50 hrs after beginning penicillin. female 17 in an in-patient program 12/24 got her/took to hopsital diagnosed with strep throat tx penicllin 12/25 acquired yeast infection tx monostat. 12/26 returned to the program she was told to study fell asleep while reading-was told that she is not following the rules. is it unusual for someone who has strep throat/yeast infection to be tired/feel badly after 50 hrs of tx.
Baseline Response: it is unusual. the disease is usually caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine. It is very common in people with streptococcus or other bacteria.

Expected Response: no it's not unusual. the effects of the illness will still exist because it takes a while (a week or so) for the bug to be annihilated by the penicillin and your immune system. also penicillin increases your white blood cell count and so your own body is still fighting the bug. the medication itself doesn't fight it. your body is still going through the purging process of getting rid of the bug. so you will still feel sick and tired for a while. taking too much penicillin can cause ill effects as well so try not to do that. just let it run it's course.

In this case, the spoxyank is the sponds. In spondys, there are many different types of sponds, but the common type is the type of spongylolytic spond.
The spond is a very tiny spong. It can be very large or small, depending on the type. The reason for the sponding is that the spion is very short. It has a very short length, so it can take a long time to get to the spone. It's usually about a foot long. It doesn't have a lot of spongs, so if it gets too big,

Baseline Response: it's a cold. i've been sitting in a room with no heat and no power. i'm not sure if its because i'm cold or if the heat is just too hot. i think i've experienced a cold at least once. i was in the bathroom for about 20 minutes and had a "cold" for about 3 minutes. i don't know if this is a cause of cold or an effect of the heat. i have not seen any negative results on my temperature. i am not sure what the cause is, but i'm a little worried that this is something that happens to people when they get cold.

Question: compare palliative with hospice care
Baseline Response: compare hospice with hospices.
If you are not sure, ask your doctor or a hospice to evaluate your condition.
What is hospice?
A hospice is a small group of physicians who offer care to the sick and the elderly. In this way, they can be more knowledgeable about your condition and better able to help you through your treatment.
How is hospices different from hospice hospitals?
Both hospices and hospice homes are different places in the world. The two are different because both are more hospitable and more hospice than home. Hospices and homes are not alike.
Is hospice a hospitable place or a home?
No. Hospice is an independent entity and does not operate on the same level as a hospital.
Why do hospices have different names?
The hospice name and name of a hospices home are often different from the name of the

Expected Response: palliative care and hospice care often are mentioned in the same sentence as if they are the same thing. they are not but they do share certain characteristics. hospice is care for people at the end of their lives and their families. hospice care encompasses physical emotional and spiritual support. it is not offered only to the dying person but to the entire family as well. hospice care is not about prolonging life; it is about providing comfort care and measures designed to enhance the dying person's quality of life. and this is the point where hospice and palliative care overlap. palliative care too is about maximizing a person's quality of life. however palliative care is not just for patients with limited life expectancy. any person with a serious illness or chronic medical condition may benefit from palliative care. palliative care takes a holistic approach to addressing pain--physical and/or emotional--and other issues of comfort. for example a palliative physician might order special skin creams to minimize the pain and tissue irritation from radiation therapy for cancer. palliative team members may include specially trained physicians nurses psychotherapists social workers physical therapist occupational therapists nursing assistants and others. this team focuses treatment on the patient but also offers support to family members. i hope this helps!

Question: what medicine can i give my 2-year-old for vomiting and diarrhea?
Baseline Response: I don't know what you mean by that. I've tried a lot of different drugs, but none of them seemed to work. The first one I got was an anti-diarrheal drug called Adderall. I think it was the most effective. I'm not sure what else to tell you about it, but I think you might have a better idea of what it is.
It's not like it's a cure-all. It's just a medication that makes you go to sleep better. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's very effective. It has no side effects, and it's just as effective for my baby as it is for her.
And I've been using it for about 12 years. It was never really a problem, but a few days ago I went to the doctor and I was told I'd have to have an IV

Expected Response: the biggest concern in a young child with vomiting and diarrhea is the risk for dehydration. i would recommend a fluid electrolyte replacement product like pedialyte for your child. pedialyte will help replace vital nutrients that can be lost while sick. start with a teaspoonful every 5-10 minutes and you can keep increasing as the child is able to tolerate it.

Question: should i send my 2 year old to a doctor after 7 days of yellow green mucous nasal discharge? . he started with mild 38 degree fever for 3 days clear mucous on day 1 and 2. mucous started to become yellow/green with bad chesty cough that sounds phlegmy.
Baseline Response: the doctor said it was yellow mucous.

Expected Response: maybe. yellow-green mucous is not a definitive sign of a bacterial infection in a two year old but it could be. this color change is usually caused by stagnation of the flow of mucous just the way a pond turns green if there is not a good in and out flow of water. two year olds do not blow their noses. if your child is ill or feverish. if he seems to be getting progressively worse. then yes seeing his medical provider would be a wise decision.
================================================================================
Question: can u take allegra d while taking z pack. doctor says i have bronchitis he gave me a z pack. can't sleep cus of drainage. possible allergies.
Baseline Response: yes, but if i go to sleep for more than 6 hours, i should get a z-pack.
I know you don't have to take z-packs because you get to use them a lot. If you do, try to get a zip-up and you can get the extra space and use them.
You can also use a zip up on your bed, but you can't use it when you're sleeping in bed.
If you're using zpacks on the bed, you can use them for sleeping in the house.
When you're taking zpacks, you'll need to sleep in a bed that's made of solid or flexible material (like a mattress or a pillow) that's close to the ground.
As you're going through the night,

Expected Response: the "d" in allegra d is a decongestant that cause drainage especially if you take it near bedtime. the antihistamine component in allegra is fine at bedtime so you may want to consider losing the "d" at bedtime. a z-pack (azithromycin) is compatible with this medication.

Baseline Response: i'm very good at eating a meal and a portion of food every day but i don't get much protein. i would like to see some kind of protein supplement. if i can do that i'll be able to get some kind. i also like to eat and exercise but not as much as i would want. i just don't have the energy to eat much.

Expected Response: the goal should not be to lower your metabolism but to start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain. it doesn't matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein calories and nutrients. that's because inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake (total calories) means protein is used for energy instead of for muscle formation. exercising more can increase your appetite and weight training can gradually help you put on muscle. it may take time to see results but because muscle weighs more than fat you are likely to gain weight. here are some tips: eat regular meals and snacks every day. try to plan your meals ahead of time and have items you can put together for quick and healthy meals. gradually build a list of balanced meals you can make for yourself. include 3-5 food groups at meals including a whole grain lean protein fruits vegetables dairy and healthy fats. for example in the morning you might have a big bowl of oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts and a side boiled egg. include 2-3 food groups at snack time which may consist of cheese and whole grain crackers or an apple with peanut butter or half a meat sandwich with veggie sticks. gradually increase exercise to include cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. for tips on how to exercise to build muscle see this article. what you may discover during this process is how much better you feel by moving more and eating better. you won't regret starting on a healthier road! i here this a great deal at the school i teach at. if you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan. first keep a food diary for three days. are you really eating as much as you think? when counseling athletes at school i generally recommend they consume 1. 8-2. 0 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. so for you at 150 lbs = 68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122 -136 grams a day. now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need. develop an eating plan. here's an example: breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk protein in meal = 20 grams lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts (8 ounces) 2 cups of veggies (broccoli green beans califlower) 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt protein in meal = 69 grams dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin (3 ounces) remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 1/2 cup fat free cottage cheese protein in meal = 38 grams snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter (protein: 7 grams) 1/4 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit (protein: 12 grams) total protein for the day = 147 grams notice there's no junk food (chips soft drinks etc) or any expensive supplements just good solid nutritional foods. regarding exercise the best way to add weight is by adding muscle. to do this you need a well thought out strength training plan. follow the link pasted below to find a great beginners workout on webmd <link> as you advance you can find some additional info here <link> <link> like i said earlier the key to healthy weight gain is with a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan both of which you can find here at webmd. to be on the safe side be sure to check with your physician before starting. i had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts. i had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class. let's keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle mass/weight. 1. rest - get two days/week of rest to recover from training. you grow when you're resting. you can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously. take it easy on those days and don't do anything too physical. 2. train - lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 1/2 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics. next day do it in reverse. repeat this cycle throughout the week. if you're an athlete you'll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day. when running do sprints. do high impact high intensity exericises. do not perform long-distance endurance training. if you have to run don't go over 3 miles. 3. eat - consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits. 3/4 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat. 1/4 of your meal should be protein to build muscle. contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle. consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein. you want that carb for energy to push harder and grow bigger/stronger. eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal. you will bulk up in size/strength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month. if you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs. always drink a ton of water! find people with similar goals to train with! it's not just about building your body it's also about building a community. good luck!

Baseline Response: The boyfriend took a male sex drug and did not report it to the police. The boyfriend also took an OTC male sex pills and did NOT report them to the hospital.

My boyfriend was a regular guy and I never had any problems with him. I have had multiple girlfriends and my boyfriend is a good guy. I do not know if he ever abused anyone.

Question: how do i deal with the guilt of not taking my mother to family events? she has alzheimer’s and can’t handle crowds. my sister and i agree it would do more harm than good.
Baseline Response: i can deal with this by using my own words and my own experiences to my advantage. i am not going to lie, i am a good person and I am not lying to you. i was not going after her because she did not want to go to family. i will not lie to you about the guilt or not.
I am not taking her to family, it is my job to make sure she does not go to her doctor. I will not tell anyone about her.
If she is not at her doctor's office, i will ask her to come to my office and make sure that she is OK. i do not want her to go and have her taken to her doctors office.
i am not talking about her being

Expected Response: families often feel emotional at holiday time especially if a parent is unable to join them to celebrate. you and your sister seem to be aware and respectful of your mother's needs and comfort and that is to be commended. you are doing her a service by not overwhelming her in a crowd. if it is possible you can celebrate with her in a different setting and at a different time. most facilities plan holiday celebrations for residents at a time different from the specific holiday. this enables families to come there and dine with their loved ones rather than taking them out of their "comfort zone. " if her memory support unit does not offer this then you can plan your own "mock thanksgiving dinner" with her. it is common for memory-impaired persons to be disoriented to day/time so you will be creating a thanksgiving day of your own.

Question: why is a “power down hour” important to good sleep?
Baseline Response: because you're sleeping too much.
The truth is that most people have a hard time staying awake because they're too tired. In fact, it's so common that it's even considered an "abnormal" occurrence in most studies.
Here's a good example of the problem:
"In an interview, the person who was the subject of the study reported that he had a hard night's sleep in his sleep room, which caused him to become less able to focus on his work and concentrate on his job. He had also reported that his mood had become progressively worse, and he had become more depressed, anxious, and withdrawn. In other words, he was experiencing a chronic state of tiredness."
"The other study did not find any evidence that sleepiness was associated with the occurrence of an abnormal sleepiness, or any other characteristic of sleep. However, one of the main

Expected Response: one of the things i talk about in my book is having what’s called a powered down hour. and in the power down hour you have 3 twenty minute segments. so the first segment is forgetting stuff done that you just have to get done or it will drive you crazy. so in our house it’s getting backpacks ready for school finding shoes you know things that you do when you have kids. the second twenty minutes is reserved for hygiene so brush your teeth wash your face maybe even take a hot shower or bath. the final twenty minutes is reserved for meditation relaxation stretching things of that nature that i’d want you to do in bed and i’d want you to do it in the dark okay. because what that does is again it sets that mood and allows you to start to fall asleep. now many people don’t have an hour before they get into bed so you can do the power down half hour if you want like 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes.

Question: how soon i see if hormon therapy change me from male to female
Baseline Response: i've been on the therapy for a while and i've seen it works. i've never been on this thing before. it's my turn now. i can't believe this is happening to me. so i'm going to do it. i will be a boy and have a girl. i want to be a girl and not a boy. i hope i can learn from this. i'm just trying to figure out how to be okay with it and not being able to change myself. I want to make sure that my life is okay and not be like this. so many things i can do now, but i just can't make it. so much pain and worry. and i am just trying so hard to be good for my family.
Reply: I just wanted to say thank you so much for your time. You're a fantastic person and I hope you continue to have the same

Expected Response: most helpful answer well i hope you understand that taking female hormones alone will never physically change your genitalia to that of a woman. in other words you will still have a penis and scrotum. however female hormones will gradually feminize your appearance and you will grow breasts. as i say this is a gradual process. it doesn't happen overnight. more like weeks to months. if you're transgender (as i'm assuming you are) i hope you're under the care of a trusted medical professional. i've had the privilege of working with many transgender patients and i know that products circulate illicitly within the community. i would urge you not to attempt to use female hormones without medical supervision. you don't necessarily know what you're getting with some of those black market products products purchased from websites and so on. if you are under the care of a medical professional good for you! he or she should be able to help guide you through the complexities of changing genders. i wish you all the best on this journey!

Question: what are all the treatment options for straightening a penis that has been bent in an angle due to tight underwear? . 19 year old. had a perfectly natural straight penis with an upward curve (like a perfect banana) in childhood up until puberty. used to wear tight underwear and slept in a certain way (putting penis in between legs) with erection until morning. penis no longer curves upwards but now curves downwards and to the right. when i'm excited penis gets very hard especially glans and the shaft turns into an hourglass figure which feels good & goes away after full erection. penis doesn't hurt at all
Baseline Response: i'm using an old, but still comfortable, but now my penis is too big and it feels like my penis has been too long in a straight line. I'm also using a new condom which is more flexible & has a stronger adhesive, which has helped my penis stay longer.
Answer- I've been using this condom for 4 years now and

Expected Response: there are two chambers in the shaft of the penis called the corpus cavernosa. when blood engorges the corpus it should equally fill but in some cases one side gets more blood than the other causing a deviation. in severe cases where one side of the corpus does not engorge at all this is called peyronie's disease. the blood supply may be due to a plaque or blockage. this is not caused by tight underwear. as a matter of fact tight underwear should have no adverse effect on the angle of your erection whatsoever. since you cannot be adequately diagnosed over the internet and since this change is concerning you you will need to see a urologist (find a male urologist) to be properly evaluated.

Question: is it possible to have had chlamydia for over 17 years and not know it? after having a child as well with no symptoms? . i was recently hospitalized with abdomen pain. they did the regular std checks to rule out pid. all came back negative but they want to take one for chlamydia. i have only been with my husband for over 17 years and vise versa. is it really possible i could have had it that long and not known? or am i worrying for nothing?
Baseline Response: Yes, it's possible.
You're not sure, but if you do, you might be able to answer.
Answer #2:
Answer Number 3:
If you have a chlamydial infection (chlamydia), you should not have it.
The infection is caused by a virus or bacteria. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated food.
If your chlamycologist does not have chlamyspes

Expected Response: hi you should find this info very interesting and the way chlamyda can hide for many years. most unfortunate is the ability of chlamydia to hide itself deep inside the genitourinary tract making it very difficult to detect by urethral swabbing and urine analysis; two commonly used sample collection methods for chlamydia testing in clinical practice. thus many urologists and std doctors are unable to identify chlamydia as a causative pathogen. as a result they often make general diagnosis such as non-specific urethritis prostatitis and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) etc. and they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patient’s condition more complicated; weakening the immune system causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative pathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc. do hope this helps good luck

Question: is it ok to break your blood pressure tablet in half later if your blood pressure is still high. i take blood pressure meds and sometimes it still goes up. not for long. i was curious can you break your tablet in half and take it if it has been a while since you took the first whole med.
Baseline Response: no. i am not doing this for a medical reason. it is for my own personal needs.

Expected Response: i can see why you would ask this question. it seems like a very logical solution doesn't it? however i would not advise doing this. first of all there are several different types of blood pressure pills. some of them work by relaxing blood vessels. others work in the kidneys. others work by reducing blood volume ("water pills"). taking a little extra of one type of pill might not harm you while taking extra of another type of pill could cause your blood pressure to go dangerously low. second it's normal for your blood pressure to fluctuate throughout the day and even in different situations. for instance your blood pressure may go up if you've recently been walking (or for some people simply standing up). your pressure can go up if you're angry anxious or feeling emotional. on the other hand your blood pressure can go down if you're feeling very relaxed or if you've been lying around all day. this is normal. the important thing with blood pressure medication is that it controls your pressure "on average. " if your pressure usually falls within an acceptable range as determined by your healthcare provider then you're doing fine. however if your pressure is often or regularly elevated even though you take your medication as prescribed then you should let your medical provider know. lastly don't take your blood pressure too often. there's no point. taking it once a day at the same time every day usually is sufficient. take it around noon or 1pm if possible. always write down your readings (and note if you were sitting down walking angry or anything that could affect your reading) and take this information to your doctor appointments. your provider will appreciate getting this feedback. wishing you well!

Question: what is non viral hepatitis
Baseline Response: it is a viral hepatitis, a viral infection. It is a virus that infects the body. It causes infection by infecting a person's skin, blood, or organs with the virus. In the United States, there is no known risk for non-VIRAL hepatitis. If you have non-viral hepatitis, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately.
What are the risks?
The risks of non-viral hepatitis are the same as for non viral infections. If there are any signs or symptoms that suggest that you may be at risk of infection, call your healthcare professional immediately. If your symptoms are not as severe as those of a non-infected person, your healthcare practitioner may recommend an antiviral medication.
How should I get tested?
If you have any questions about your care or are concerned about your health, call the National Center for Health Statistics at 1-800-CDC-1088.

Expected Response: hepatitis simply means "inflammation of the liver. " while most people think of the viral hepatitis varieties ( hepatitis a hepatitis b hepatitis c and so on) when they hear the term "hepatitis " the truth is many things can cause liver inflammation -- not only viruses. a few non-viral causes of hepatitis include: alcohol abuse drug abuse environmental toxins trauma (injury to the liver) fatty buildup in the liver (often caused by poor diet habits) autoimmune diseases (a situation in which the body's antibodies attack its own tissues including the liver) some of these types of non-viral hepatitis may be reversible with behavior modification. others may be chronic (that is lifelong). if you have questions about your liver or if you've received a diagnosis of non-viral hepatitis feel free to discuss your questions and concerns with your health care provider. wishing you well!

Question: lost 50lbs since 4/12 injured my back and had surgery in 9/12 and probably again in 12/12. how do i keep the weight off? . started nutrisystem 4/12. . had my gallbladder removed 6/12. . quit smoking on 7/12. . 9/12 i got a shooting pain down my legs and soon after went numb between my legs. i had emergency surgery and am still in a lot of pain. might need a spinal fusion but insurance is fighting it. . how can i continue to lose weight when i am unable to exercise. i tried to do all of the right things to get healthy and am having no luck. any suggestions? . thanks . carrie
Baseline Response: lost 1lb since 4th injury. . have been working on a new back with a couple of other friends and i was able to keep my weight off for a few weeks but i still had a lot to do. i just started to

Expected Response: first off congratulations on your weight loss! i think you have a couple of choices right now. you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery. in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity. it's best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program. i don't know how much weight you have to lose the calories you've been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration. i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism. you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do. i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight. you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success. and just because you are not losing weight now doesn't mean you won't be able to in the future. good luck!

Question: can type 2 diabetes cause hair loss?
Baseline Response: Yes, but the risk is very small.
A very small risk. A very small number of people have type 2.
What is your best method to prevent hair loss or hair loss from hair loss that happens during pregnancy?
A lot of people are looking to find a solution to their hair loss problems.
Why do you think this happens?
There are many factors that can cause hair follicles to become damaged.
The first is the hormone imbalances in the blood.
It is not uncommon for people with Type 2 diabetes to have hair follicle problems. This may be because they have the hormone imbalance that causes hair loss.
Another factor that can affect hair loss is the hormones that are in the body.
If you have a problem with hormones that you have never had before, it can be very hard to find an alternative.
There is also a genetic factor that causes a hair loss problem.

Question: my 25 year old son lost his adderall and can't get a replacement for 30 days. is there an over the counter alternative? . my son got his new monthly prescription two days ago and inadvertently threw the bottle away thinking the bag it was in was empty. he will not be able to get his monthly dosage until his next appointment in 30 days. is there a safe over the counter alternative he can use which at the least will help to lessen the focus and concentration issues that will inevitably arise. thank you for any guidance you can give.
Baseline Response: The only way to prevent this issue is to start with a prescription and wait for your patient to take the prescription and then proceed to a prescription. The only time you can stop a patient from taking a prescription is when the patient has taken their medication and has a problem with the medication. This is not a problem that can be corrected by going to the pharmacy and asking for a prescription for the medication you are using. If the

Expected Response: no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.

Question: what are the problems with picking a 24 pound child up by her wrists? . this child is 20 months old and has been subject to this since she was crawling. please advise.
Baseline Response: I think it is too young to pick up a 24-year-old child. I think she is a little girl and I want to keep her happy. I am not sure if I would be able to do this without having to pick her up by my wrists. If I could pick her out, would I not be able?
Answer-
I think that the problem is with the hands. I would pick her in a more natural way. The hands are not strong enough to hold her in place. I don't think I would want her to have to pick them up by their wrists. I feel that the hands are too strong for a 24 year old to pick.

Expected Response: the problem usually doesn't occur in the wrist but the elbows. it is quite easy to painfully dislocate the elbow (subluxation of the radial head). this is called the "nursemaid's elbow". it is best not to do this.

Question: is eating a large teaspoon full of peanut butter worse than eating a large teaspoon full of ice cream?
Baseline Response: yes, and that is why I want to make a dessert.
In the past, I've tried a lot of different types of ice creams, and I have a lot more ice cream in my freezer than I do on the counter. But it seems to me that eating a larger scoop of icecream or a smaller scoop of peanut milk would be worse than getting a smaller spoonful of ice Cream.
I also know that most people are afraid of peanut cream. I've been told that it is not safe to eat it in public. It is not really safe to be in public, so I don't know what the difference is.
If you can't eat it, and you don't want to be a part of a group of people who are afraid to eat peanut butter, then you shouldn't eat peanut cream in public because it might be dangerous.

Expected Response: worse in what way? if a person ate of teaspoonful. just a teaspoonful of either of these food sources they would be just fine. one may have more calories than the other but when you compare it to the total day intake it would not make much of a difference. peanut butter has more protein but i don't know what kind of ice cream you are eating. who can eat just a teaspoonful?

Baseline Response: No, it is not okay to drink any castor or oil.
Answer 2: Should I try to swallow the contents of my penis with a spoon?
No, there is no need for that.
If you feel a burning sensation in your penis, you should try to eat the contents.
In some cases you should also try to take a few drops of castor solution.
What about when I use my penis to masturbate?
If it is very hot, then you should be using castor.
You should not try to use castor with other products.
Why is it bad for me?
Because it causes a lot of pain.
And because it has an unpleasant smell.
But you should not drink it.
It is also not ok to use it on yourself.
When I use it, it feels very hot and

Question: what are the side affects of taking 3 to 5 times recomended otc probiotic would it cause unhealthy weight loss. i think this is causing my wife to loss weight by stopping nutrition being absorbed
Baseline Response: I think that the side effects of taking probiotics are the following. 1) the effects of the probiotic on the body of the person. 2) the changes in the body that the probiotics can cause. 3) the effect of the bacteria on the person's immune system. 4) the body's response to the probin. 5) the consequences of the effects on the immune system of the bacterium.
Answer 1: The effects of probiotics on the stomach and intestines are the same. 2. The effects on a person's health are the opposite. 3. The effect of a probiotic can cause a person to have weight loss, and also a loss of function. 4. The side effects on health and weight loss are the exact same.

Expected Response: most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as "natural" or "healthy" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the "good flora" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!

Question: do i need a tetanus shot for a thermal burn? . i burned my hand on a pan today while i was making cinnamon rolls my thumb was only on the pan for less than a second. the burn is white but not bubbling or anything its just a white mark. i ran it under cool water for like 30 minutes and added aloe. it barely hurts. im planning on getting a tetanus shot this year anyways but i need to know if this is very serious or i can just get my shot whenever.
Baseline Response: i am not sure. if you get a thermal you are going to get a very long shot. i am

Expected Response: tetanus (the disease) is quite rare but the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing it if you have one every ten years. minor burns like you described are not high risk for tetanus. not knowing when you had your last one i cannot advise you specifically but having a tetanus shot now -- if you are due for one anyway -- would be a good idea. i should have added. "quite rare in the united states". unfortunately tetanus is much more common in other countries.
================================================================================
Question: what is epilepsy?
Baseline Response: epilepsy is the process of seeing a person's head or body, which is usually seen as a part of a person, or an object, that is sometimes seen as part of the body. It is a form of epilepsy, which can occur in two or more people, in which the person is often seen as having a part that is not part of his or her body.
In the first case, the person has a seizure or a seizure-like behavior.
The second person has an episode of seizures.
This is a common occurrence, but it is rare.
What is epilepsy and what is the cause?
Epilepsy is the seizure of the brain, or the disorder of the head.
A seizure occurs when a person is suddenly unable to move or perform a task or act.
It is a disorder of sight, hearing, smell, touch, and sensation of pain.
Sometimes it is caused by an abnormality in

Expected Response: epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than 2 million people in the united states -- about 1 in 100 -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.

Baseline Response: no insurance or any kind of insurance. i have a doctor who specializes in ear infection. i've got a case where i was going to be hospitalized but i'm not sure if it was my ear or my doctor. I was told to have a blood test done.
I have a case of ear infection, and am at a loss for words. I've been told that I'm allergic to earbud. I'm not trying to make this up. I just can't get any more information from them. I also

Expected Response: most helpful answer drug store clinics are just fine for this type of medical issue. you may have a case of otitis externa and need some prescription antibiotic/steroid ear drops. in the meantime a solution of 50% white vinegar (acetic acid) and 50% water - a few "body temperature" drops instilled in the problematic ear a few times per day will help i would go to the er and see if they can help you afford it. sorry could be much help but that's what i did when my son had the same thing they had to put tubes in his ears.

Expected Response: could it be a swollen gland that just makes it feel like your adam's apple has moved? your larynx is pretty firmly attached and you would be having debilitating pain and great difficulty breathing if it had moved.
================================================================================
Question: what can cause burning while you pee if your doctor already ruled out any type of infection?
Baseline Response: if you're going to be in a serious infection like a herpes virus infection, you need to have a hot shower or showering before your surgery. Also, if your body has been exposed to a viral infection, it can cause a lot of discomfort and pain.
How can I help?
The best way to help you is to talk to your doctor about what to do and how to prevent the infection.
What's the best way for you to get a hot bath?
If you're worried about your skin or your urinary tract, you should get your doctor's hot bath kit.
If your doctor says you should not get hot baths, ask your doctor if you can get a cold shower.
Do you have a fever or a rash?
How many times have you seen someone with a fever before?
When you're feeling very tired, it's best

Expected Response: i don't know if you are a male or female but chemical irritation (soaps laundry detergent dryer softeners etc. ) or irritation from sexual activity can certainly cause burning.

Question: i have a skin condition but it doesn't seem to meet any of the ones i've researched. what is it? immensely itchy. on my arms legs butt thighs and a few other places. i have raised skin that is skin coloured and in little patches. it itches immensely and comes and goes.
Baseline Response: i am a small girl and i have been using a lot of antihistamines. i do not know if this is a good thing or not, but i am doing my best to keep my skin to the minimum.
I am a 14 year old who has been using antihistamine for a month now and i'm trying to stop it from causing any issues. it's just that it's a little bit too sensitive to the things i am using and i can't seem so comfortable with it. i am very interested in this topic and i want to help others out.
i am going through some other problems with my skin and i hope that others can

Expected Response: making a dermatological diagnosis requires an examination often by a dermatologist. a vague description is not sufficient information to make that important "what is it? " call nor is researching your skin condition on the internet. there are thousands of possibilities. as much as i would like to help it would not be possible to make a blind guess as to the nature of your itchy skin eruption.
================================================================================
Question: what happens if i had an air bubble in insulin i injected?
Baseline Response: i have a blood test that is very important to know if i'm taking insulin and i'm going to be getting a lot of insulin. If i don't get insulin, then I don't know if my insulin is going to work. If my insulin does work, then i'm not going to get insulin. I just don't think that insulin will work. So I think that the only way to be sure that your insulin is working is to check your blood pressure. If you don't have blood pressure, then your insulin will not work.
If you do have blood pressures, then you are not going into a problem. If your blood pressures are too high, then it's going to make you less insulin.
So you can take insulin without problems. But if you are a diabetic, you may want to take insulin. You know, when I started taking insulin, I was taking it for

Expected Response: nothing.

Question: what if i'm taking a medicine that can lead to bone loss?
Baseline Response: the answer is yes. It may be that you may have a bone loss that you have never seen before. In fact, if you are taking a placebo, you will have a disease that is not completely normal and may be caused by a natural hormone. It is very important to remember that the hormone is not a drug, but a medicine. There is no cure for cancer, so you should take it at your own risk.
The fact that your body may not be able to take the hormone in the proper way is a reason to take a placebo.
You will also need to take certain medications that are not available to you.
If you are a person who has been taking a medication that is illegal in your country, please speak with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of taking a drug that is legal in your state or country.
This is a general rule that should be

Expected Response: if you need to take a medicine that can cause bone loss talk to your healthcare provider about taking the lowest possible dose for the shortest amount of time for your condition.

Question: is melatonin a dietary supplement for acid reflux?
Baseline Response: yes. In fact, it is an essential nutrient that is essential to the body's functioning. In other words, melatonin is a vital component of the body, and it is essential for your brain to function properly.
It is also the best known and most effective dietary supplement.
The key to your body's ability to function is your ability to maintain a healthy metabolism.
Melatonin is essential in the body to maintain normal function. It is a hormone that helps regulate your blood sugar levels, which is important for your body to be able to maintain proper function.
What is the best way to maintain your metabolism?
Melamine is an amino acid that is the natural precursor of your body. It has been found that melamine is beneficial for the maintenance of healthy metabolism in the blood.
If you are on a high-fat diet, melamine supplementation will help you maintain your body weight.

Expected Response: no it's not. melatonin is a hormone made by a small gland in the brain. melatonin helps regular your sleep-wake cycle. it is sold as a dietary supplement for people who have trouble sleeping. some people say melatonin is helpful for getting over jet lag. these claims may be true but have not been proven by good studies yet. i'm not sure what supplement you might be thinking of for your acid reflux but there are many over-the-counter remedies available to you. you can always ask the pharmacist for advice on what antacid product might be best for you. some antacid products can interfere with medication absorption so it's a good idea to check with your pharmacist or health care provider before choosing an antacid. wishing you well!

Question: does lipo flavonoid reduce or cure tinnitus?
Baseline Response: Yes. Lipo flavone is a chemical compound found in many foods and medicines. It is the most important component of the human diet. It can help to reduce the symptoms of tinnitis, or mild tinniness. Liposin is one of the most common types of liposin. Lipotoxicity is the result of a chemical reaction between lipotoxic compounds and the lipopolysaccharide of the liposome. In some cases, lipotoxicity can cause anemia, inflammation, and death.
What are the symptoms?
What is the cause of tnitus? The first symptom is tinnition, or tinnage in the neck. If tnitis occurs, the tinnar and tinnaria are the most prominent signs.
The tinnary is a large, narrow, curved, blackish-brown or reddish-white part of

Expected Response: the short answer to your question is: no. currently there is no cure for tinnitus unless it's caused by a curable underlying condition (such as taking too much aspirin). tinnitus (or "ringing in the ears") can be more than annoying. it can become a debilitating problem in which the "noise in the ears" can drown out other sounds including a loved one's talking. if you believe you have tinnitus start with a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. you may be referred to a hearing specialist. while medication are available to treat tinnitus many people rely on masking devices that sort of "counteract" the interior noise of tinnitus. there's also a new hearing aid available that both amplifies sound and masks the tinnitus noise. wishing you well!

Question: does vaseline really help to grow eyelashes? . & if so i have heard to use a q-tip to apply vaseline to the eyelashes directly and i have heard to apply it to your eyelid. which one if not both is better/safer?
Baseline Response: not at all. a few other reasons:
1. you need a lot of Vaseline (or any other stuff that you can't afford to buy).
2. you have a lot to lose if you lose your eyelashes.
3. you lose a lot more of your skin if you can no longer afford to use Vaseline.
4. you are going to have to get used to the idea of using a little Vaseline to help your eyelids grow.
5. you will have to start using a lot less Vaseline than you used to.
6. your skin will be getting more irritated.
7. your eyelash will start to look a little gre

Expected Response: most helpful answer vaseline is safe to use on your skin but it will not help to grow eyelashes. you can use it on your eyelids but it may be yucky if you get it in your eyes (although this would be harmless too).

Question: could my heartburn treatment interfere with other medications i'm taking?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 2: my doctor told me to check my blood pressure and blood pressure at home.
Solution: to my surprise I found that my blood was indeed lower than normal. I was told that my body would not respond to my medication and it would be too late. This is a very unfortunate outcome.
I had my blood taken and a blood test to see if my blood sugar was normal. The result was a normal blood sugar. The doctor told my doctor that my medication would not work for me and he was going to send me to a hospital. I did not feel well.
So I went to the hospital. My doctor told the family that my medications would not help me and that my family would have to pay for my medication. I had to get my medication back to the doctor. The family were very upset about this and were very angry. I'm not sure why my

Expected Response: some medications need at least a little bit of stomach acidity to break down and be absorbed by your body. ask your pharmacist about the specific drugs you're taking so you can try a heartburn treatment that won't interfere with absorption of these other drugs.
================================================================================
Question: how much of an impact does vitamin d have on depression?
Baseline Response: I do not know. I'm not sure what it does for your brain. But I'm pretty sure it does a lot of damage.
This is what I mean by the word "damage."
I know it's not as bad as the idea of the vitamin d, but if you take it for a week and then you see a difference, it's probably worth taking it.
I don't think you should take the vitamin D for a day. You're not going to notice that.
The thing I'm trying to emphasize is that vitamin D is not a drug.
If you take vitamin D regularly, you're not taking a drug that is going to get you into depression.
So if you're taking vitamin D to get rid of depression, that's not taking any drugs.
It's not a prescription.
You're not getting the drugs you need.
There are no

Expected Response: there have been studies suggesting that high dose supplements of vitamin d or fish oil supplements may improve mild depression. . at this point treatment with high-dose vitamin d for depressive symptoms is considered experimental and should be considered only with medical supervision.

Question: can an epi pen be used for a penicillin allergy
Baseline Response: an epipenem is a pen that is used to remove a small amount of epi bacteria from your body. It is used in the same way as a pen is used for the removal of bacteria. It can be used to make a small incision on the skin that is not needed for the allergy.
It can be a needle that is inserted into the skin.
You can use it to make small incisions on the body.
An epipensal or epigastric device is an epidermis that is connected to the skin and the skin is not covered by the epidermal layer.
A epipenedal or an epigstric device, or a wound device, is a device that is attached to the epigestive surface of the skin by a thin layer of epidermolymph.
When used as a wound, the epip

Expected Response: an epipen can be used for an anaphylactic allergic reaction caused by anything. if the person is having difficulty breathing generalized hives etc. that epipen is needed so you will have time to get to the emergency room. if the person just has an mild penicillin rash or mild hives epinephrine is not the preferred treatment.

Question: what are the screening tests for prostate cancer?
Baseline Response: The screening tests are for the screening of prostate cancer.
The screening tests can be done on a computer screen, a computerized screening device or a blood sample taken from the prostate.
What are the tests for:
The prostate cancer screening test
The blood test
What is the blood test for: The prostate cancer test
How does the screening work?
The testing of the prostate cancer is done on an industrial scale using a machine made of steel. The machine is usually a machine with a machine-made computer, a power supply, a battery, a camera and a computer.
In order to test for prostate prostate cancer, the machine is designed to be operated by an individual with a high-powered hand.
A high-power machine is a machine that can perform all of the test. The high-intensity machine is the one that can take the test and then record it on a camera.

Expected Response: besides the manual testing by your doctor there is the psa test that might tell you a little about what's going on in your prostate. if you have any conditions it might be wise to look into natural supplements like super beta prostate supplement. it contains beta-sitosterol that really supports prostate health.
================================================================================
Question: can childhood vaccines cause autism?
Baseline Response: No.
The answer is that they are not.
However, in fact, vaccines can cause autism. The majority of children with autism are not exposed to the vaccines, and the majority of these children are not affected by them.
Children who are exposed to these vaccines have more problems than children who are not, and in fact they are more likely to develop autism.
People with autism have a number of genetic conditions that may be associated with autism, such as mutations in the genes that make them autistic.
These conditions include:

Mutation in the gene for the protein that makes them autistic

Infection of the immune system

Immunization

Inflammation

Vaccination

The vaccines are not safe for children with these conditions, and they are usually not taken to prevent the disease.
What is Autism?
Autism is a genetic disorder that is not inherited. This means

Expected Response: there has been ongoing controversy surrounding certain childhood vaccines and their relationship to autism. many studies have looked at whether there is a link between autism and vaccines. to date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism. a suspected link between the measles mumps rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism has been suggested by some parents of children with autism. typically symptoms of autism are first noted by parents as their child begins to have difficulty with delays in speaking after age 1. around this same time the mmr vaccine is first given to children. therefore autism cases with an apparent onset within a few weeks after the mmr vaccination may simply be an unrelated chance occurrence. parents have also questioned whether mercury-containing thimerosal (used as a preservative in vaccines) might cause autism. today with the exception of some influenza vaccines vaccines used in the united states to protect preschool-aged children contain reduced or no thimerosal as a preservative. (influenza vaccine is currently available both with thimerosal as a preservative and preservative-free. ) according to the cdc there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. more importantly studies have not found a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. because the exact cause of autism is not known parents may continue to have concerns despite the evidence. in these cases parents should be aware of the risks of serious disease in children who are not vaccinated. in some areas outbreaks of these dangerous diseases have occurred in people who have not been immunized. understanding the ruling on autism-like symptoms and vaccines in a recent controversy a georgia girl was entitled to compensation after developing autism-like symptoms after receiving five childhood vaccines in 2000. but what does this decision mean to your child and to other children? it's important to note that the government has not said that childhood vaccines actually cause autism. rather the division of vaccine injury compensation (dvic) at the department of health and human services agreed there is a possibility that the vaccines aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder in this young girl. the mitochondrial disorder manifested as a regressive neurological disease with some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. understandably many parents are worried about the risks that are feared to accompany vaccinations. ever since the first vaccines were developed there have been risks. most vaccine side effects are mild and severe ones are extremely rare. but the use of vaccines in children has essentially eradicated a number of major childhood diseases that kill. when parents fail to vaccinate their children the risk of serious -- even deadly -- disease epidemics extends beyond them and their families to their neighborhoods and communities. failure to vaccinate lays the foundation for new epidemics that could result in serious harm to your child. for instance a decline in vaccination rates in some european countries has led to fatal outbreaks of measles. in short whereas advocacy groups against childhood vaccines continue to take issue with immunizations cdc officials maintain that this recent ruling should not be generalized to the risk of vaccines for all children. in a statement the american academy of pediatrics reinforced its dedication to the health of all children and urges parents to fully immunize their children.

Question: what is the prognosis for people with chronic hepatitis c?
Baseline Response: a) there are no good prognosticators for chronic hepatitis C. b) there is no good information about the prognosticator's ability to treat hepatitis C in the general population. c) there does not seem to be any clear link between chronic hepatitis and liver disease.
How do you know if you are taking a hepatitis C treatment?
What is the best way to treat chronic hepatitis?
How can I help people who have chronic hepatitis who are taking hepatitis C?
If you are having any questions about the treatment, please contact us at info@cathortecreative.org.

Expected Response: in the best case the treatment will achieve a sustained virological response (svr) which means that the hepatitis c virus is not detectable in the blood six months after treatment ends. an svr is the goal of treatment. although the virus is not eradicated its growth is suppressed. the chance of achieving an svr depends mostly on the genotype or strain of the virus. an svr is achieved in approximately 45% of patients with genotype one and between 65% and 75% of patients with genotype two or three. successful treatment should be followed by regular check-ups and a healthy lifestyle. although the overall prognosis for chronic hepatitis c is good some people will progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. a liver transplant may be an option but any replacement liver will also become infected with hepatitis c.

Question: does it hurt when ear tubes fall out
Baseline Response: Yes. There are several ways to cut down on ear bleeding, but the most common is to use a piece of foam tape or a foam roller to prevent any bleeding from the ear.
How to remove ear tubes:
Remove the ear tubes from the tube.
Remove all of the ear tube's contact points.
Place a small piece of plastic wrap around the ear and wrap it around the tube using a piece or two of foam.
You may want to place a piece on the tube and remove the ear stem. This will help the tube to stand up and help you keep your ear from being damaged.
Once you've removed the ear stems, remove them from the tubes.
If the tube is attached to the tube, the ear is removed from the Tube.
There are two ways to remove the ears from the cable.
The first way is to remove a piece from the end of the tube (to

Expected Response: when you say can't keep food down i'm not sure if it is forceful vomiting or frequent spit up. gastro-esophageal reflux (ger when food comes back up is common in babies occurring in half of babies under 6 months old. some are referred to as "happy spitters" meaning they frequently regurgitate (2 or more times per day) but are growing and eating without other issues. but if it gets worse with time or is more projectile or is accompanied by other symptoms (wheezing gagging etc. ) and there is poor growth it's a problem. gastro-esophageal reflux disease (gerd) is ger coupled with problematic symptoms and needs a doctor's attention. if you suspect your child has gerd or some other problem see your doctor again. for more on gerd see this webmd article. you also might want to see a lactation consutant for tips on breastfeeding positions and feeding techniques (like pumping before feeds) to decrease spitting up after feeding. good luck!

Question: i drank 4 cups of fruit soda. so i have anxiety. i drank 4 cups of carbonated fruit soda. now you know when carbonated droplets splash up your nose so they did splash. now i have been thinking could this cause secondary drowning? plz explain thx
Baseline Response: i'm in the middle of a long term relationship with a friend who is a big fan of my diet. we've been together for a year and a half now and i'm pretty sure that she's not thinking about this. i'm not sure what this is. she's really into food and i've always been, but i've never eaten it. i've had to start over because i'm still not sure how it feels to have this. she is really into it. she likes to drink a lot of fruit and juice and she likes my diet, but she doesn't like me being so focused on it. and she's never been a huge fan of me being too focused

Expected Response: your over-indulgence in drinking soda would not cause you to drown from carbonated droplets in your nose.

Question: i have bronchitis. am i better of wintering in florida or in ny?
Baseline Response: you are better of floriditis.
I have broncho-vascular disease.
You have bronchiitis. I have bronchinitis. Do you have any other symptoms?
I do not have any symptoms.
Answer.
The symptoms of bronchospasm are not that bad.
Do you have a problem with the blood pressure?
Yes, but it is not that serious.
In your case, you do not get a good blood pressure.
This is not the case.
What happens when I have a bad blood pressure or when my blood pressure is too low?
If your blood pressure gets too low, your heart stops beating.
If it gets too high, your brain stops beating, and you have trouble concentrating, you are not a good person.
Are there any other problems that you have?

Expected Response: the choice of where you live should be determined more by your preferences than by your bronchitis. bronchitis (i don't know what type or severity you have) can be effectively managed in any climate. personally i am no a big fan of cold weather so i would head south for just about any reason.

Question: how can you start working on relationship issues?
Baseline Response: we can't, because we have a lot of people who are very involved in the process of making decisions. So, we can only do it if we're very good at it. It's not a matter of being in the same room as everyone else, we're just doing our job. But, I think it's important to know what you're doing and what you want to do.
The next step is to think about what you can do to help the relationship.
I think it is very important to think of what you need to do to make the relationship work. You need to know that you're making the relationship better, and that you want the person to feel better. And then, you need something to help you do that.
For example, if you're a parent, and you're having a difficult time with your kids, or if you have a very serious problem, you might want to know

Expected Response: when i treat couples i usually send them questions to answer before they even enter our first session. these questions help orient them to the relationship’s strengths and weaknesses. it helps them take responsibility for their part in their problems as well as identify what they would like their partner to change. and it encourages them to think about what they want from their relationship. these questions can be helpful to anyone struggling in their relationship – even if they are not in need of therapy. the questions are: what is going on in your relationship now that is a problem? how has this affected you? how have each of you contributed to the problem? your contribution? your partner’s contribution? what have you done to try to correct the problem? /li> and in what ways have any of your attempts been successful? how will you know when therapy is done? (if you are not seeking therapy think of the question this way: how will you know when your relationship is what you want it to be? ) for example: what will each of you do differently? in what ways will the relationship be different?

What I am doing is trying to find out what I can do to help.
I have been asked to do some research, and the results are very encouraging. I have tried to look for any problems that I can find

Expected Response: any of these symptoms could be a sign that something is wrong with your pregnancy. don't wait for your prenatal visit to talk about it. call your doctor right away if you experience: severe abdominal pain or cramping. bleeding. severe dizziness. rapid weight gain (more than 6. 5 pounds per month) or too little weight gain (less than 10 pounds at 20 weeks into the pregnancy).

Question: can diet help with chemotherapy nausea?
Baseline Response: there are some studies that have shown that diet can help with nausea. A number of studies have shown a reduction in nausea among people who are overweight or obese. These studies were conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1990s, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a dietary supplement called DHA. This supplement is said to be effective in treating nausea.
What is the difference between DHA and other dietary supplements?
DHA is a compound found in the blood that is found in a variety of foods and supplements. DHA is sometimes called a "fatty acid" because it is found naturally in the body. DHT is a chemical found in blood that affects our body's metabolism. This can cause a variety, and sometimes different, effects on our body. Some people have severe nausea when they consume DHA, which can be severe, or it can be worse.
There

Expected Response: there is no special chemotherapy diet. but experts say that foods that are spicy or strong smelling are more likely to cause nausea. "ideally i'd like people to eat a healthy diet during chemotherapy so that they get enough vitamins and minerals " says christy russell md chair of the american cancer society breast cancer advisory committee. "any foods that get you through your treatment are probably ok. " you need to stay hydrated. dehydration can interfere with your treatment and has other risks. "if you don't drink enough fluids you can wind up in the emergency room " says carmen escalante md chair of the department of general internal medicine at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center. eating smaller meals more often than you used to may prevent nausea says escalante. although you should never force yourself to eat when you're nauseous russell says that it's important to eat regularly. "never come to get chemotherapy on an empty stomach " says russell. "it just raises the risks that you're going to feel queasy. "

Question: i have tried four different medications for depression. am i not giving these medications time to work? . each had side effects that caused me to stop taking them. should i continue to search for a new medication?
Baseline Response: i can't find a medication that works for me. my doctors told me that this was the reason why I couldn't take them. i have no idea why i was so upset and worried. i am sorry that i was upset and confused. i really should have asked my doctor before taking these pills. i feel so bad for the family.
Answer

Expected Response: there are 20 different meds you can try and sometimes it make sense to go until you find one that fits a bit better. you likely did not try them long enough and yes sometimes you get [the] worst first. but you have others you can try. psychotherapy has no side effects; ask to be referred to a psychologist for counseling perhaps.

Question: besides medication are there better ways to help with hypothyroidism? . i have trouble with not being able to lose weight. having no energy. being depressed. being tired all the time. body aches. they are continuously changing my medication dosage but i see and feel no change.
Baseline Response: I have tried the following solutions to help me lose weight:
1) A lot of medication can be given to me to help control my mood. It is a good idea to take a few days a week to stop or medicate. 2) A small amount of medication is needed to help get me going. 3) I am able to get my thyroid functioning again. 4) I can control my body's hormones. 5) I have been taking a lot of medications for years. 6) I think my body is getting better. 7) I'm able to feel my body in a more relaxed way. 8) I get better and better at moving around and doing things

Expected Response: better ways? no. if you truly have hypothyroidism thyroid hormone replacement is the best way to treat it. there are no rules in medicine that state that all of your symptoms must be related to your hypothyroidism so your doctor needs to look for other things that may be causing your array of symptoms. i am sorry to ask this but are you a female? i only ask because your tyroid gland affects everything in your body. ask your doctor to check your estrogen levels. i was the same as you until i seen my gynecologist. i am now in hormone replacement therapy and feel much better. i wake up feeling alive i don't feel like i'm walking in a fog all day. hope this helps. <positive_smiley>

Question: i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?
Baseline Response: It can be from the skin, bacteria and fungus, it could be the skin itself. this is something that has been studied on the internet. if you have any information please let me know.
Answer - I have been using a lot of antihistamines, but I have not had any serious problems with my skin. and i have been able to avoid the symptoms of the rash

Expected Response: i don't know if this helps as i see this was posted a while ago but while in search for the same help and advise i ended up going to the hospital because it was just getting unbearable. if any of your signs are similar its best getting it checked out to confirm after all i'm not the doctor. signs: - skin redness - really really itchy skin - appears randomly (mainly arms legs tummy and neck) - rash (small areas of raised skin) that appear and disappear whenever it decides to. what the said is that i have atopy or atopy syndrome which is basically a hyperallergic. a person with atopy typically presents with one or more of the following : eczema ( atopic dermatitis ) allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) or allergic asthma. you can read all about it more online and just like any allergy there are ways to help deal with it or reduce the affects. i hope this helps somebody <positive_smiley>

Question: my 2 yr old grandaughter has a small indention an inch above her belly button that hasn't been there until now.
Baseline Response: she has been there for 3 months now and she is still on her tummy button.
She has been on her bottom side for 2 months and she has had the tummy down for 3 days.
It is a little painful to look at her but her tumma is still there.
We have taken her to our local hospital for her treatment.
They are doing a CT scan and are doing the ultrasound.
I have had no other problems so far.
The pain is now gone.
My grandaughter is a nurse and has had no problems so this is a great day.
Thank you for your time.
You are very welcome
I am glad you are taking her to a local hospital.
But I am very sorry if you have any questions.
Please feel free to ask anything.
If you would

Expected Response: unfortunately it's impossible to say what this is without a physical examination. i suggest you take the child to her pediatrician for an exam. it's possible what you're seeing is not so much an indentation as a bulging of the belly button that gives the impression of an indentation above the navel. this could indicate your granddaughter has an umbilical hernia. luckily these are not serious and may not even require treatment. however that's just a wild guess. you should have your granddaughter examined by her pediatrician to find out exactly what's going on. wishing you both all the best!

Question: should i use the same surgeon for multiple procedures?
Baseline Response: yes, but the only way to determine if you have multiple procedures is to do a single checkup.
This is the most common complication for the patients.
1. The doctor has to tell you the exact procedure.
2. The surgeon is not the only one.
3. The patient is not informed.
4. The surgery is delayed.
5. The patients do not feel well.
6. The procedure is done well. However, you have a different doctor than the one who is not able to tell the exact cause of the complication.
7. The following can be corrected by an emergency room physician:
8. The hospital doctor will tell you about the procedure.

Expected Response: 13 it’s a great question. the answer is the best doctors will do the right thing. those that aren’t quite at the top of the totem pole won’t. doctors are human beings. we come in all sizes and shapes different motivation. some are driven by excellence and some are driven by their bank accounts. but i would tell you that when you do your homework and you keep your eyes and ears open it kind of all sorts out. the patient who does the homework that asks the right questions that kind of sizes up the practice and acts like a smart consumer just like when you go to buy a car there’s sometimes that you just know you’re getting hustled the observant patient will sense that. how the questions are answered and who answers the questions by the way because some practices employ almost like sales people not physicians to do the what they call selling which is not appropriate in a professional practice in my opinion. this is not like buying an appliance. it is not like buying a car. this is a highly professional service. i think you need to spend time with a doctor not with someone who has no medical education and couldn’t even address those issues safety for example. so i think you need to get a sense of it. i think most people do. i think most people make the right decisions. unfortunately good decisions require work and the rich and famous don’t necessarily make the right decisions either. so it’s not a matter of money or how affluent you are or not being able to purchase because frankly most of the practices are affordable today they really are. for most working people you can afford it. you can finance it you can put it on credit card. but whatever it is that’s not the issue. the issue is making the right decision so that you’ll be happy and of course have a safe experience.

Question: how can thrush be prevented?
Baseline Response: This is a simple matter. One of the most important reasons why thrush is a good idea is that it is a very simple way to keep things clean. This is true even when thrush-based solutions are not available.
What is thrush?
Thrush is a new kind of "clean" process, which means that it will keep things in a clean state. It will also keep your body from becoming dirty.
How can thrash be prevented, and how can it be avoided?
It is not possible to avoid thrush completely. The best way to avoid it is to avoid the entire thrush process.
The best way is to use thrush as a method to maintain a clean body.
Thrush is not a simple process. You can learn more about it in my article How to Avoid Thrush.
One of the reasons why Thrush is so useful is that there are so many

Expected Response: the following can help you prevent thrush: follow good oral hygiene practices. brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss at least once a day. avoid mouthwashes or sprays. these products can destroy the normal balance of microorganisms in your mouth. see your dentist regularly. especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures. limit the amount of sugar and yeast-containing foods you eat. foods such as bread beer and wine encourage candida growth. if you smoke quit. ask your doctor or dentist about ways to help you kick the habit.

Question: what is bipolar depressive type? is that a seperate type of bipolar or is that what a doctor calls a depressed episode? . i was released from a psychiatric hospital and in my discharge papers the doctor had written "bipolar depressive type". i had never heard of that before. i was wondering if a depressive type of bipolar actually exists and what that is? is it a subtype of bipolar or did he maybe just not know what to diagnose me as? . thank you!
Baseline Response: i'm not sure. i think it's a subtypical type of manic depressive disorder. i'm going to go into more detail about that in a future post.
Answer #2: I don't think there's a difference between bipolar depression and bipolar depression. i'd say that's a different issue.

Expected Response: a depressive type of bipolar disorder has a client who mainly exhibits depressive symptoms. loss of interest sleeping isolatation worthlessness and suicidal thoughts etc. another form would include more manic episodes which include rapid thoughts speaking spending. overlly cheerful optimistic may be mistaken for life of the party. manic phase can also be very productive periods for socially functioning people who are often highly intelligent motivated and don't want meiciation slowing them down. unfortunately highs for some can spike and crash into psychosis sometimes only sometimes violence. over spending into debt other impulse problems rocketing into severe depression. note; there are many varations on cyclic mood dysorders.

Question: i skip my periods with my birth control (trinessa). i am sexually active. and very busy so if it is unnecessary for me to have a period u would rather not have it. my boyfriend and i use both condoms and my birth control. is there a higher chance of pregnancy if i skip my pills? or is there even a chance of pregnancy? i take my pill pretty religously but i have had times where i have missed the time to take it and have taken it hours later.
Baseline Response: i think you're wrong. I don't know. i don't think you would agree with me. If you're a woman who is using birth control, then you should definitely take your pill. I would advise that you go ahead and do so.

Expected Response: hi from the first bit i take you just keep taken the active pills then? that way you do skip periods but you should only do this for 3 months then take a 1 month break have a period then do it all again. as for pill taken at least you are taken them daily but if you have a mobile phone they all have alarms use yours for pill taken daily this should help you. get that working right then you can do away with the condoms. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my insurance was cancelled due to not able to pay and i now own the insurance co $2000. is there anyway to reduce this. i am a student and missed two payments for my insurance. if i don't have $600 by the end of the month which i probably won't i will have to pay the insurance for the prescriptions it paid for. this will be over $2000 and is an enormous amount for anyone especially a college student. i called the insurance company to see if i could pay the $600 in installments but they said i couldn't. any advice?
Baseline Response: if you are planning to take a college course and you are considering taking a college degree you should make sure that you have the money to pay for the prescription. I am a college grad and have a $6000 deductible on my college credit card. and the insurance they are charging me is $200 so it will cost you $200 to pay it off. if you would like to help me out with

Expected Response: talk to someone who is in charge at the insurance company. if you don't have the money they are not going to get anything unless they sued you. you are willing to work out a payment plan and i think they would be fools not to accept your offer. don't take the first "no" for an answer. i suggest that you find the name of the head-honcho. the supervisor. and direct a letter to them with your proposal. this is an expensive lesson on the importance of not missing payments.

Question: can a tape worm live out of the body. i was curious if a tape worm can live out of the body. specifically under a rubber mat in a community shower area?
Baseline Response: I believe that the worm is able to live out the body but it must be within a very short distance to be able to survive.
I have no idea what the worm's bio is but i would like to know what its like to live with it.
My own worm is not living in a house and i am not sure how to feed it, but i am sure it would not have any problems feeding it.


What if a worm could live in the body of a person?
I know that is not possible, but if a live worm does live in a body of another worm it would be very unlikely that it would live in that body.

My worm has not lived in a home for years, and i believe that it could live there for a long time.

Expected Response: no. a tape worm requires a host and only lives in the intestines. not under a shower mat.
================================================================================
Question: what are shingles and postherpetic neuralgia?
Baseline Response: the term postherpinial neuralgias is not the same thing as postherpinephrine. In fact, postherpingal neuralgiae are the only known forms of postherpenial neuralgeia.
Postherpies have a wide range of neuralgial function. Some are submissive, others are aggressive, and still others are subservient. In general, postpies respond to stimulation. In addition, postpharyngeal neurallepia is the most common type of postpie response. It is a more general term, and encompasses all types of postphygies.
It is believed that postpiedial neuralleps respond to a variety of stimuli, and are able to respond to both postherpes, the most commonly occurring type, and the most severe type, as well as to other stimuli, such as anaphylaxis

Expected Response: shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus the virus that also causes chickenpox. in a person who has been exposed to chickenpox -- or its vaccine -- the virus never really goes away. it can lie dormant in the body's nerves. in most cases it stays that way. but in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. this is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. when it comes back the virus can cause shingles: a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. early shingles symptoms can include: headache light sensitivity flu-like symptoms without fever. itching tingling or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next and the pain can be moderate to severe. are you contagious? though people who haven't had chickenpox can catch that condition from you the shingles itself isn't contagious. for reasons that experts don't really understand the pain of shingles lingers for some. if the pain lasts for at least four months after the shingles rash appeared a person is diagnosed with phn. in some people the pain will subside. in others it won't. "we don't have any idea why the pain goes away in some people and not others " says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y. but the longer you have phn -- especially after a year -- the less likely it is to resolve he says.

Question: i have chronic constipation. my dad wants me to try castor oil. is this something i should do?
Baseline Response: yes. you can use castor and castor oils if you have a family member who is very sensitive to castor.
Answer 2: the castor is a very effective treatment for constipation, but the benefits are far from clear.
Solution: if you do try castorex (not castor) and you are sensitive to it, it is much better to take a regular diet.
The biggest risk to you is that you may have a very low level of vitamin C.
There are many different ways to take vitamin C, and some are better than others.
One of the best is to take it in a small dose. This will help with your immune system.
Another way to take the vitamin C is to apply it to your skin. This helps to protect you from the sun.
Some people have taken the vitamin

Expected Response: i know your dad wants to help you but i don’t think this “old remedy” is a good choice. it is important that you work with your doctors trust them and their judgment because the treatment selected depends on the cause of the constipation. it’s work in progress.

Question: i have an ear infection and am having trouble keeping the drops in my ear. they drip out when i sit up. i am using ciprodex ear drops (as well as antibiotics). when i put the drops in my right ear i can't seem to get them in. i can sometimes get 1 drop in out of 4. i lay on my side for about 15 mins but when i sit up i can feel them slowly drip out. i also tried the drops in my uninfected ear no problem going in. is this because of the infection? what can i do?
Baseline Response: I'm still having trouble with the drops. i put them in my left ear, but it is still not in my ears. i don't know if they are getting rid of the infections or not. i think that the infections are going to get worse and worse.
Answer of the day: i am having a very hard time keeping the ear drops in. the first time i

Expected Response: there can be several reasons. since i can't examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the ciprodex (there are several different types of "ear infections") it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason. one reason could be ear canal swelling. in otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut. some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate. other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris. many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will not go in. i would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last.

Question: are people with schizophrenia dangerous to themselves or others?
Baseline Response: No.
The main problem with schizophrenia is that they can go into a state of psychosis that can cause severe damage to their brain. This can lead to a psychotic break-up or to a major depressive episode.
A person with schizophrenia has a very high risk of developing psychotic symptoms. They also have a higher risk of being hospitalized for a psychotic episode. The person with psychosis is usually less likely to experience symptoms or be hospitalized for an episode than the person with normal mental health.
In the case of schizophrenia, a person with an increased risk of psychotic symptoms should be evaluated for psychosis at least once a year.
What is the difference between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder?
What's the difference?
Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic condition characterized by recurrent and often serious problems with attention, judgment, judgmental control, and control of other important life activities.
It's not known whether schizophrenia is a disorder

Expected Response: if symptoms are under control and medication regimens are adhered to there is very little chance that a person with schizophrenia will be a threat to themselves or others. moreover most people with schizophrenia are not particularly prone to violence with most preferring to be left alone. if someone with paranoid schizophrenia does become violent it is most often directed at a family member and usually occurs within the home. however people with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for suicide and attempt to take their life more frequently than the general population.

Question: should a 10 month old baby get the antitoxin to botulism after injesting honey?
Baseline Response: yes, it should.
In addition, it is important to note that this can occur in honey, but not in any other substance. In fact, honey is the most common of all natural substances used in honey production.
How to Protect Yourself from Honey-Bites:
1. Be Careful!
In a honey-biting situation, bees will eat your honey, or even the bees themselves. If you are in a bee-bitten situation, do not let your honey fall from your face.

Question: my daughter has crohn's disease. can she take ibuprofen?
Baseline Response: No, she can't. She's just too sensitive to the pain.
Answer to

Expected Response: you can take acetaminophen (tylenol others) for pain. you will want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin ibuprofen (advil motrin others) or naproxen (aleve). these are likely to make your symptoms worse for crohn's disease. i've had crohns' disease for 50 years. in those days the treatment for chrohns' was primitive. it was first diagnosed in 1942 the year i was borrn. i was in 2nd year medicine at the time & had to take a couple of years out before i could gat back. it was thought to be ulcerative colitis at the time & it was 12 years before we found that the small bowel was affected as well & i required at the time to have 6 ft. of my small bowel removed (no fun). now i can tell you that over the couinter drugs are useless in treating a flare-up. you need an anti-inflammatopry such as prednisone to battle the flare-up. anything less is useless. i advise you to go to your doctor & get a prescritption for prednisone. you start at 8 (5mg. ) tablets the first day. the next day take 7 then 6 etc. you'll probably find that the flare-up will be over in 4 or 5 days & you won't even finish the prescrption. one must be careful with drugs like prednisone; they are steroids & must be used with care. btw i once talked to dr. crohn in a conference call. he was 92 & living in connecticut. i'd strongly advise against taking nsaid's especially is she has ulcers because they can cause ulcers to bleed.

Question: does going outside in 40 degrees after working out & you are still sweating no jacket contribute to catching a cold
Baseline Response: no, just like a cold does not help you with your day.
If you get cold during your workout, you can't do any of the things that you'd like to do, and you don't know how to deal with it. So, you need to take the time to think about what you can do to make yourself feel better.
What does sweat help you do?
Warm up.
Wear your sweatpants.
Eat healthy.
Work out.
Get some sleep.
Have fun.
And, if you're feeling a bit stressed out, you may be able to look into using some of the exercises above to help you get out of it.
How to get started:
1. If you don´t have a sweatpants, you'll need to find a pair of apron and a pair "j

Expected Response: no it doesn't. colds are caused by a virus. despite what generations of mothers have said you cannot "catch your death of cold" simply by going outside in the cold while wet or sweaty. you catch colds by coming in contact with one of the more than 200 varieties of virus that can cause the symptoms of a common cold. usually rhinovirus is the culprit. you can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands frequently and refraining from touching your eyes or nose. it's not uncommon for a person to touch an object on which the virus has been deposited then transfer the virus from their fingertip to their body by rubbing their eye or picking their nose. hope this helps!

Baseline Response: you can ask the doctor if the swollen lymph nodes go away or if they get worse. They may be a symptom of a very rare disease like psoriasis. I'd like to see the doctor when i get the swelling but

Expected Response: without the ability to examine this lump first-hand it would be impossible to blindly determine what it is. and it will go away on its own. a description is just not sufficient information to make this important call. yes you most definitely need to see a medical provider in order to get an accurate diagnosis.

Question: can flu vaccines cause canceri. i am taking megace for endometrial stromal sarcoma and warfarin for pulmonary embolisms. will this years flu vaccine or pneumonia vaccine interact with my medications? are there any components of these vaccines linked to cancer?
Baseline Response: yes, there are. In fact, some of the vaccines are linked to cancers. One is a combination of the two, and the other is a mixture of the three. The first is the flu vaccine, which is given to patients with chronic lung disease. The second is the pneumococcal vaccine, given to people with pneumonia.
The third is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a deadly virus that has been linked to multiple sclerosis. The fourth is the hepatitis B vaccine, a vaccine that is administered to people who have HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.
So, in fact, if you are sick with a viral infection, you might not need any

Expected Response: flu vaccine does not cause cancer but any vaccine that you get should be specifically approved by the team of physicians that are caring for you -- the ones that know you and your medical history. the final "okay" comes from them.

Answer : If you're trying to get pregnant and you're having a bad period, start off with your normal period, or a few weeks of a regular one.

Expected Response: hi if you have had as you say two periods very close together then the chance of being pregnant is no. if you having a problem taking your bc pill and have a mobile phone use the alarm as your pill taker that way you should not miss any. ok good luck

Question: can i use my hot tub with a poison ivy/oak/sumac rash? (already washed affected area to remove oil residue). currently on day 3 after contracting rash. localized to just my feet & ankles. have already bathed rash to remove oil residue and using hydrocortisone. i have a hot tub and want to use it but am worried about causing a secondary skin reaction or spreading it to my boyfriend in the water.
Baseline Response: can I use my cold water/bathtub with a cold sore? (hehe)
Answer (alright): you can use the hot tub as well.

Expected Response: you will not spread poison oak to anyone. the skin lesions are not contagious (assuming they are not secondarily infected). the hot tub will not spread poison oak either but it is possible to contaminate a poorly-sanitized and improperly-brominated hot tub with bacteria. direct contact with your boyfriend could spread a secondary infection but you cannot catch poison oak from someone else. this is a common misconception.
================================================================================
Question: the back of my head itches and is starting to have hair loss but baldness does not run in my family. what is the cause?
Baseline Response: It is a combination of my genetics, my health issues and my genetics. I am a white male. I have a history of being bullied. I was bullied at school, at home, at work, at school and at school. I did not go to any of those schools. I went to a very high school in the South. I had a great high school but I had to go to a university. I didn't get to go in the same school as other kids. I wasn't going to go on to any other school. So I went there to see if I could be accepted and I was accepted. I ended up going to a school in Florida where I was very lucky. I saw some girls that were at the school and I said, "I'm going to meet you there and I'm going with

Question: does a hysterectomy cause hair loss?
Baseline Response: no. However, a hysteric hystysis may help. The hystrectomy is the removal of a small amount of hair follicle tissue. The hair follicles are then removed using a process called dermal removal. The follicle is then removed with a hair probe. This allows the hair follicular tissue to be removed from the hair shaft and is referred to as "therapy."
The hair folliculous tissue is then then removed by an artificial, mechanical hair removal device (a hair probe) or by a surgical procedure.
When the hair is removed from a person's body, the hair can then be treated with a variety of treatments, including:
Hair Removal:
The use of a hair removal machine (hair probe) is recommended to remove the hair from a patient's body. The machine is placed under the skin of the patient and is used to remove

Baseline Response: the children had been vaccinated against polio for 4 years, but then polio was found to be a disease that was passed from mother to child.
Answer 1: the child was not vaccinated for polio.

Expected Response: no harm but he will still need a polio booster between the ages of 4-6.
================================================================================
Question: what are kegel exercises?
Baseline Response: I'm a beginner in kegel. I'm not a big fan of it. I try to keep it under my belt until I'm ready.
Answer and Answer

Expected Response: kegel exercises also called pelvic floor exercises help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder uterus and bowels. by strengthening these muscles you can reduce or prevent urinary leakage problems. to do kegel exercises pretend you are trying to stop the flow of urine or trying not to pass gas. when you do this you are contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor. while doing these exercises try not to move your leg buttock or abdominal muscles. in fact no one should be able to tell that you are doing kegel exercises. kegel exercises should be done every day five sets a day. each time you contract the muscles of the pelvic floor hold for a slow count of five and then relax. repeat this 10 times for one set of kegels.

Question: connection between double ear infection & red bumps on back of tongue?
Baseline Response: A couple of weeks ago I received a call from my doctor asking if I was pregnant with a child. I was told that the child was not yet born. He told me that I needed to get a new birth certificate and that I should be sure I had a birth certificate before I started breastfeeding. I had to tell him that I was expecting a baby and that he had asked me if I would be pregnant. I told him that he would probably have to be more careful with my baby if I did not have a baby. I asked him if I could talk to him and he told me I would have to go to the hospital and get a birth report. I went to the doctor's office and my doctor told me he was not sure if I needed a birth cause. I thought that I had gone too far. He said that he was going to see a nurse for me and that it would be

Expected Response: as you know i can't physically see these red-bumps on the back of the tongue to specifically address your concern but i suspect these tongue bumps are normal and have absolutely no connection to a middle ear infection.

Question: how do i prevent and cure scoliosis?
Baseline Response: You should always check with your doctor before taking any medication.
If you have any questions about your health, or if you have a problem with scolistic disease, please contact your physician at 1-800-823-8255.
The doctor will review your medical history, and will provide you with information about your scolologic history, including any medication used, and any medications you may have taken.
What is scolialysis?
Scoliosis is a form of scolary disease caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream.
When you are diagnosed with scoli, the bacteria in your blood come into contact with the scolium, which is an internal part of your skin.
How do I prevent scolia?
The best way to prevent scoli is to avoid contact with your scoli.
You can stop scoliation by using a topical antibiotic or topical

Expected Response: most helpful answer scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine. in most people the spine naturally curves out a bit near the neck and inward at the lower back (the lumbar region). in people with scoliosis the spine makes an abnormal "s" curve from side-to-side. scoliosis is usually identified in children. when adults get scoliosis it's frequently a result of trauma (accident) osteoporosis (thinning of the bones of the spine) or osteoarthritis. generally speaking it's not possible to prevent scoliosis. to prevent it you would need to know what is causing it. and usually we don't know the cause of scoliosis in a given individual (except as noted above). also there is no "cure" for scoliosis. when scoliosis is symptomatic (meaning it causes pain or problems breathing) it's often treated with a brace or occasionally surgery. if you think you or your child has scoliosis you should be examined by a health care professional. many people misunderstand what scoliosis is exactly and think poor posture or slouching indicate scoliosis when this may not be the case. hope this helps!

Question: how much in government contracts have you made to promote obamacare? where did you disclose this?
Baseline Response: I have not disclosed this information. I don't know if the information I have disclosed is available or not, but I am aware that I have made money from it. I am not a lobbyist, but my interests are primarily in health care and healthcare.
If you are going to be a member of Congress, you need to be able to make money from this information, and you need some form of disclosure. If you are a lobbyist and you disclose information to the public, you are violating federal law and you are an endangered species.
I think the public has a right to know about this, and I think they need to have the information to protect their rights.
As for the health care law, I am committed to the Affordable Care Act. I'm committed to improving it and getting it done. I believe in the health and the rights of all Americans. I

Expected Response: since 2011 the funding provided by cms went to develop a variety of education programs for physicians nurses pharmacists and other healthcare providers. we have two other accredited educational initiatives funded by cms (hitech act) and hhs (hipaa compliance) respectively which are not focused on aca. when cms and other government agencies have sponsored programs and advertised on our sites the content or advertising is clearly marked as paid for by these agencies. the government makes funding data for all federal contracts including webmd publicly available through usaspending. gov.

Baseline Response: i'm 18 years old. i am a 15 year old male who is a very hard working and active male. i have been a member of the military for 10 years and am a full time male.
I'm sure you're all familiar with my struggles with depression. I've always had the feeling that I was having an affair, that

Expected Response: most helpful answer you will need to have your penis examined by a medical professional either your primary care medical provider or a urologist. this is not an er visit but you can go to an urgent care facility. try not to worry. it may not be as serious as it seems but you need to have it properly checked. you will need to inform your parents and/or show this open area to your father. in the meantime until you can see a medical provider keep the area as clean as possible and use some topical antibacterial ointment. i am unclear why you were having irritation a month before this incident but bacterial or yeast infections in this area like balanitis are not uncommon.

Question: what kind of anesthesia is used for hernia surgery?
Baseline Response: a lot of it depends on what type of anesthesia you use. If you are on an anaesthetics like a sedatives, you are probably not going to be able to do this surgery with your back pain. However, if you are also on a sedative like a bronchoscopy or a spinal compression, you will be able do it with your neck pain. If your neck is not tight, you may be able use a compression, and you can use a spinal cord. If it's not tight enough, you can also use a sedation or compression.

How to do a neck surgery? A neck surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the neck. The neck is usually made of a series of large bones called the spinal cord, which is placed on the back of

Expected Response: most hernia repairs can be done with a variety of anesthetic methods. with modern general anesthetic techniques and monitoring general anesthesia can be very safe. however the surgery can also be performed under local anesthesia or regional anesthetics often using sedation medications at the same time to help relax the patient. the specific type of anesthetic for an individual patient is selected after careful evaluation of the patient's general health and individual concerns.

Question: can a person go off high blood pressure medication if he looses weight or is this a lifetime medication once started?
Baseline Response: Yes. You must be over 90 years old, have been to three different countries and have a doctor's prescription for a diabetes medication.
You must be at least 21 years of age.
Your diabetes medication must be taken on or before 6 a.m. on or after your 12th birthday.
If you are under age 21 and you are prescribed medication for diabetes, you must be a member of the military or a civilian who is under the age of 21.
What are your medications for diabetes?
These medications can be taken in any of the following ways:
1) by mouth.
2) by hand.
3) by injection.
4) in the stomach.
5) in your lap.
6) in a small bag or bowl.
7) in an empty bottle.
8) in bottles.

Expected Response: when a person becomes overweight they make it harder for their heart to function. think about it: every pound of extra fat requires extra blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells. as your heart works extra-hard to pump blood through possibly miles of extra blood vessels it can cause high blood pressure. when a person who is overweight loses weight the opposite effect can occur. the fat and extra miles of blood vessels have gone away with the weight loss so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. this can lower blood pressure. so yes if a person is overweight and takes high blood pressure medication they may be able to get themselves off the meds by losing weight. i say "may" because factors other than extra weight may be causing the individual's hypertension problems. if you are overweight and taking medication for high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you begin a weight loss program. that way your healthcare provider can monitor your progress and adjust your medications as you lose weight. no one should ever stop taking a medication like one for high blood pressure on their own. that definitely could have bad consequences. wishing you well!

Question: for the past few days i have been experiencing dizziness and slight pressure in my head is it anxiety related? . i was taking birth control but was having side effects so i stopped a few days ago. my symptoms tend to come and go a lot of the times i notice them when i am at work. when i am home relaxing the symptoms seem to go away. i do worry a lot and wonder if this could be anxiety related (i have been having tests done for possibly a risk of cervical cancer) or possibly still having side effects to my birth control.
Baseline Response: i have experienced these side effects as a child. i have a history of birth defects. i am very sensitive to all kinds of things and i am a very sensitive person to the environment. i had this issue with my first baby and i had to tell my doctor about it.

Expected Response: this could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people. since your symptoms seem to improve when you're not at work and you've only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests i would suspect that anxiety could be the cause. it could also ironically be a side-effect from stopping (or starting) the birth control which can have physical side effects. you can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but i don't think you have too much to worry about.

Question: does azithromycin treat every bacteria in your whole body
Baseline Response: yes
Answer from the author: "I am a physician, so I am very familiar with the various ways in which azithrombotic antibiotics are used, and I am not sure if there is a scientific reason for using them. However, I know that many people would benefit from taking azithrylmethacrylate (AzHPAT) or azithrozole (AzZM). Both of these are highly effective antibiotics, and are used to treat many diseases, including Crohn's disease, breast cancer, autoimmune disorders, and many more. However... I do not have the information to make a definitive conclusion about the efficacy of azithrobacter, as I have read that it is not effective in many diseases. However my understanding is that azithroxam is a more effective treatment than azithradiol, and that the effects of azitriptyline (a

Expected Response: azithromycin is considered a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic which will treat many different bacteria but certain not every one in you whole body. it will only effect susceptible strains.

Question: how many excedrins are safe to take in one day?
Baseline Response: There are only 1,000 to 2,000 excedrin pills, each with its own dose and the same safety profile. If you take the same amount of excedrine daily, your body will probably have to adjust the dose to accommodate the amount of different doses.
Another interesting fact is that there is a very low chance that you will die from a serious illness from taking excedra.
I believe that you should take the most powerful excedrops to prevent death, but if you are not careful, you can end up with an even lower death rate.
However, there are many other factors that can affect your risk of dying from a rare disease.
For example, the risk of heart disease is higher among people with the same blood pressure, for example. This is because blood pressure is a key factor in the development of blood clots and can affect the quality of

Expected Response: excedrin is a nonprescription medication that contains acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. there are a number of different formulations available including excedrin maximum strength excedrin migraine excedrin tension headache excedrin menstrual complete and excedrin pm. per the product label the maximum number of tablets that should be taken in one day varies for each product. please consult your package label for the maximum amount that can be taken each day.

Question: does the risk of miscarriage increase with a pregnancy after age 35?
Baseline Response: Yes, the risk increases with age.
In general, miscarriage is not a sign of a disease. It is a sign that a pregnancy has progressed.
What is the risk?
There is no risk of pregnancy for men with a history of miscarriage.
How many women do I have to consider if my pregnancy is a miscarriage?
The risk of a miscarriage is one in every 6,000 women who undergo abortions.
For women with a previous miscarriage, the number of abortions is about 3,000.
The odds of pregnancy if a woman had a previous pregnancy are about 1 in 5,000, about 1,000 fewer than the odds of a previous abortion if she had a miscarriage. If a woman has a previous miscarried pregnancy, she is about 1/3 as likely as a man to have a miscarriage if she has a miscarriage or if she is pregnant.
If a woman

Expected Response: studies show that the risk of miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks gestation) is 12% to 15% for women in their 20s and rises to about 25% for women at age 40. the increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities contributes to this increased risk of miscarriage in older women.

Question: how do i know how much weight to lift?
Baseline Response: I have no idea, so I'm not going to answer that.
How much weight should I lift? In my current training routine, I lift about 4kg.
What should I do if I'm feeling tired or sore? I can't tell you how many times I've lost weight in a single day.
I can tell you what I'm doing to get better. You can take a few minutes to go from there.
When I get tired, I feel like I'm going to go on the treadmill or something. I'm hoping that I can do that, but I'm pretty sure I'll have to go back to the gym and do it again.
Can I lose weight? No.
You can lose weight in just two ways:
1) you can get used to it and go on a high intensity run.
2) you will feel like you're on the ground and you

Expected Response: when you first begin a strength training routine it’s always best that you start out with a much lower weight than you think necessary and progress until you reach an appropriate level. most people aim for 8-12 or 12-15 repetitions per set but don’t just stop your set because you reached some arbitrary number. it’s important to keep working your muscles until you reach muscular fatigue. if you find that you are doing an excessive amount of repetitions per set then it may be beneficial to increase the weight further to bring that number down to a more manageable number. if you’re doing too few repetitions consider decreasing the weight to bring the number up a bit since it may be too heavy of a weight for you. remember to always reevaluate what you’re doing while strength training. you want to be continually challenging yourself and progressing. try occasionally increasing the weight by small increments adding more repetitions to your set or adding more sets to your workout. if it might help some people will write down and keep a log of the weight number of sets and number of repetitions for each exercise that they do if you can’t recall off the top of your head. trial and error is the way to determine how much weight to lift. select a weight that looks close to what you think you can lift based on your goals. if general conditioning is your goal then select a weight you think you can lift eight to 12 reps (or 12-15 reps for beginners). if you can lift it 25 times with ease then it's too light and if you can lift it only four times then it's too heavy. there are no formulas to calculate this. simply decide what your goal is so you know how many reps to lift take a guess by looking at the weights and then give it a try. you'll get good at this quickly. find the ones you are most comfotable with the more comfortable you get the better they are

Question: what are other things you can do for acne?
Baseline Response: I'm sure you'll find some information that helps. It's a good thing to have a good acne care plan, too.
The other thing I'd like to add is that I've tried different brands of acne care products, and I've found that I have the best results. I've also tried a variety of different acne care formulas, and the results are similar. The fact that there are many different acne treatments is one of the most important things about acne care.
It's not just about the ingredients. The way you choose to treat your acne is important. You can make a choice to have some acne treatment for acne, or you can use a combination of acne treatment and acne treatment.
There are a lot of different things you could do to manage acne, but one of them is to always be patient and be patient.
I think that it's important to be patient, and to always have

Expected Response: cosmetics: don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted coverups or even foundation as long at it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). there are many quality products available. facials: while not absolutely essential steaming and "deep-cleaning" pores is useful both alone and in addition to medical treatment especially for people with "whiteheads" or "blackheads. " having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it yourself. pore strips: pharmacies now carry under a variety of brand names strips which you put on your nose forehead chin etc. to "pull out" oil from your pores. these are in effect a do-it-yourself facial. they are inexpensive safe and work reasonably well if used properly. toothpaste? one popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. there is no medical basis for this. ditto for vinegar.

Question: i just lost my job on oct. 4 and will have health insurance until oct. 31. if i am not re-employed with health insurance by the 31st will i be fined?

Question: what is shadowing by people with dementia?
Baseline Response: Shadowing is the practice of using a visual cue to aid in memory retrieval. In fact, some experts believe that the use of shadowing is a form of "memory enhancing" that is often done in conjunction with physical stimulation.
Shadowings can also be done in a number of ways, as described below.
Some of the most common are:
- The use of a visual stimulus to help with the retrieval of memories
- Using a visual signal to help the memory retrieval
- Having a visual or auditory cue to help in the retrieval
The following are some of the more common methods of shadowings:
The first is to place a light source in front of your eyes. This light source will help you focus on the task at hand. When you are done with the task, use a visual and auditory cue. The visual cue will help to focus on your focus, making it easier to remember the task

Expected Response: shadowing is following mimicking and interrupting behaviors that people with dementia may exhibit.

Question: 8 year old stomach pain for 12 days rash off/on vomiting pale face. had urine and bloodtests came back normal. ultrasound of abdomen came back normal. was giving ibuprofen for pain but had been on it for too long monday will be two weeks and shes not getting any better. dr though it was strep and strep rash but that came back negative too. my daughter is miserable and i need advice! shes been to an urgent care center as well.
Baseline Response: 8 month old stomach pains for 12-14 days rash. had blood tests come back normal, but was getting a lot worse and was in a state of shock. was given ibupropin for pain and nausea. was getting regular blood tests for any signs of a problem. she was getting IV fluids, but the next day she was still vomiting. she had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and vomiting. was also given the usual antibiotic and was given some ibuprocin

Expected Response: is she on antibiotics? amoxicillan is an antibiotic that can cause rash. it's not necessarily an allergic rash just a side effect. keep up with the ibuprofen no aspirin. keep her comfy and hydrated not with sugary drinks and juices (which are sugary drinks). water is best if she is not eating try some of the drinks for children that replace electrolytes and have some vitamins. if she has no fever is eating and drinking ok don't get too upset. assuming she has been vaccinated against all the nasty bugs. many things cause rash but be on top of fever rash and stupor (sleepiness confusion). i might want to have blood work to rule out meningitis if she has not been vacinated. viral meningitis can cause rash too but is a milder form of the disease. mono can cause rash and is common with kids.

Question: my erections have shrunk by 50% in everyway over the past two years. what might be causing this? . when i have an erection sometimes i am unable to ejaculate. there is still plenty of pre-ejaculatory fluid. i am on several medications: two for high blood pressure synthroid a statin anti-depressant anti-anxiety stool softeners. these drugs all do there job well for each condition they are designed to treat. i have been a fairly large consumer of alcohol in the past but have cut down considerablly on this recently. i also have two spermatocysts connected to my left testicle.

Expected Response: hi well things are stacked against you even getting an erection but you say you get hbp statins antidepressants and antianxiety drugs are renowned sex killers. with this amount of shrinkage you could try jelqing and stretching but to regain its not going to be easy could well take a year to 18 months if your really up for it jelqing and stretching are pe exercises and your find them on www. pegym. com suggest you go and have a good look round the site just to see how others are doing and read around the forums and its not just for young guys i still do some and i'm 68. its gets blood going down your penis and this helps me with erections do love to get a good hard-on and keep it going. but with one testicle not working means you only getting half of any sperm your producing. do you gat any feel of ejaculations if so could be your getting retrograde ejaculations this is where your sperm goes backwards into your bladder if you see sperm in your urine that could be it and there is no answer for that. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: can i spread herpes to my children? . i just found out that i have herpes type 2 i had a cold sore on my mouth and the doctor thinks i passed it to myself down there. i need to know if there is any possibility at any time to pass it to my children.
Baseline Response: yes, but it is not easy.
How can i tell if you are infected with herpes?
How do i know if i have a cold or flu?
What is the chances of a cold case in your home?
Who gets the cold?
Does your child have herpes? How can i know what type of herpes is in your child?
Answer : yes, and you are safe from it.
Can i get herpes in my house?
Can my child get herpes from my husband?
Is my child getting herpes from me?
Why do I have herpes in the house? Does my husband get it from me or my wife?
Which household have

Expected Response: sadly yes. you can pass herpes type 1 or 2 to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout. when you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine (antiviral drugs) to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels. herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common. there is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively.
================================================================================
Question: my husband had a minor heart attack three days ago. we have a vacation scheduled in a few weeks. is it safe to travel?
Baseline Response: yes.
A person who has a heart attack is at a higher risk of developing heart disease, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and other health problems.
Answer to the question: the American Heart Association recommends that you have a physician check for heart disease before you travel.
Note: I have a doctor visit every week at the doctor's office. I also have a regular appointment with the doctor every few months.
The American Heart Society recommends that people travel with a doctor who has experience with heart disease.
In the United States, heart-related diseases are not covered by insurance. But many people who have heart problems may need to have insurance to cover the cost of care.
What do I do if I have heart disease?
If you have an event that is listed on your insurance, see your insurance

Expected Response: it typically isn't a problem to travel a few weeks after a minor heart attack although i'd discuss this specifically with his physician.
================================================================================
Question: how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?
Baseline Response: This is the question most commonly asked, but not asked by all otc providers. There are some exceptions. For example, if you are not sure if the otonic potassium gluvate will work for you, the ota may not work for your diuretic, or if you have a history of anorexia nervosa, the drug may not be effective for you. If you have specific dietary or medical conditions, a dietary supplement may be helpful. If, however, you have other medical conditions that you do not wish to be tested for, a supplement may not always be effective.

Expected Response: first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic ("water pill") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called "loop diuretics"). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!
================================================================================
Question: i'm 15 weeks pregnant and the discharge is driving me nuts! is it safe to douche?
Baseline Response: no, you're not pregnant and you're pregnant. You're not going to die. That's what we're talking about.
Answer #2: If you're an emergency room nurse, you need to be able to get an abortion.

Expected Response: do not douche~ just go by some wet wipes and feminine soap (summers eve sensitive skin worked for me) to keep clean and buy some panty liners if need be. if there's any color or odor contact your ob! good luck!
================================================================================
Question: which cooking oil should a diabetic use?
Baseline Response: the best way to know what kind of cooking oil to use is to use the right type of cooking.
For those with diabetes, using a non-alcoholic (non-alcoholism-like) cooking oil can be a safe choice. However, when you're trying to find a new cooking oil, it's important to understand that the same type of oil that you use can be used in different ways.
What is the difference between a nonalcoholic cooking oil and a non/alcoholic non-cooking oil?
The non/non cooking oil is a non alcoholic non/cooking non oil that has been used for a while in an oil preparation.
Non/non frying is a cooking oil that is not used for cooking. It is a simple non/naturally occurring non-food.
There are many different types of non/food cooking oils. Some are not used in the same way

Expected Response: whether you have diabetes or not here are some healthy cooking oils to choose from. choosing the right oil depends on what kind of fat the oil is made with. there are three kinds of fats: saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. saturated fats are butter lard and shortening. they are solid at room temperature and linked with elevated cholesterol levels and increased risk for heart disease. if you have diabetes these should be very limited. polyunsaturated fats are canola oil sunflower oil and walnut oil. they are always liquid even if placed in the fridge. these kinds of fats can improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. monounsaturated fats are olive oil and peanut oil. they are always liquid at room temperature but become semi-solid when placed in the refrigerator. when these are used in place of saturated fats they too can reduce the risk of heart disease. follow this link to find out what the top 3 oil picks are. canola
================================================================================
Question: what is toxic shock syndrome?
Baseline Response: toxic shock is when a person is exposed to toxic chemicals such as benzene, which can cause serious and life threatening reactions.
In the UK, the toxic shock reaction is usually caused by a person who is exposed through their skin to a toxic chemical. This is a very serious and sometimes fatal reaction. It is usually fatal within 2 to 3 days.
Symptoms of toxic shock include:

Redness, red eyes, and red lips

Pain and difficulty breathing

Stress, anxiety, and agitation

Fever

Vomiting

In some cases, people may be more likely to have a reaction that is fatal, such as a heart attack or a stroke.

When a person has a toxic shock, they are usually in an area that is not normally affected by the chemicals.

Expected Response: toxic shock syndrome (tss) is rare but it’s a fast-progressing staph or strep infection that can affect your kidneys lungs and liver. symptoms of toxic shock syndrome include a high fever and vomiting skin rash and confusion.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe to take valerian when you are pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes. It is safe to use when you get pregnant, and I think it is very safe to be pregnant. If you are taking valerians in your pregnancy, you should check your cervix first, and if it does not show a good result, you may be pregnant with a sexually transmitted infection. If it does, you will need to have your cervax checked by your doctor. If your cervox does not work correctly, you are likely to have a vaginal infection.
When it comes to valeria, you can do this by following the same steps as for vaginal yeast infections. If the yeast is resistant to a lot of the medicines you are using, you need to get a special antibiotic. If this is not done, you might not have the ability to use the medicines that you need.
The most common way to get valerias is by drinking water.
If you

Expected Response: you should not take valerian if you are pregnant plan on getting pregnant or currently breastfeeding due to the risk of birth defects. if you are not sure if you can take a certain medication vitamin or supplement while pregnant talk to your pharmacist.

Question: what is the treatment for plant thorn arthritis?
Baseline Response: Plant thorn arthritis is a degenerative disease in which plant leaves are damaged by disease. It is very common and very easy to treat. Plant thorn is a very important part of the plant. It can be treated with a variety of herbs. Some plants are more effective than others.
Plant thorn arthritis can be managed by following these suggestions.
1. Plants need to be watered daily.
2. Plant leaves need to dry out after a day or two.
3. Plant roots need to stay dry for several days.
4. Plant root temperature needs to be lowered.
5. Plant plants need to sit down when they are in the shade.
6. Plant plant matter needs to dry.
7. Plant leaf temperature needs be lowered to cool the plant from the sun.
8. Plant buds need to cool down after flowering.
9. Plant soil needs to get rid of any roots that

Question: can proper nutrition help kidney disease. someone said that the foods you eat can slow down the progression of kidney disease. is this possible?
Baseline Response: not necessarily. The effects of a given diet can have a negative impact on the body's ability to regulate its own body's own energy and metabolism. However, a diet that is high in nutrients such as fruits and vegetables is beneficial for reducing the risk of kidney damage.
The primary problem with eating foods high in calcium, potassium and iron is that they can also cause problems with the kidneys.
This is because calcium and potassium are naturally very important to the kidneys in helping them function properly. In addition, the body has the ability to keep the kidneys from going through a period of high calcium, iron and magnesium levels.
However, there are some foods that are high in iron, such as whole grains, fruit juices and vegetables. These foods can increase the risk for kidney disease because they are high-fiber, high in fiber

Expected Response: diet is one component of slowing down kidney disease but so are regular visits to your doctor and taking prescribed medications. for example keeping blood sugar under control if you are diabetic will help your kidneys as will keeping blood pressure in normal range. that is a mix of diet and medications. it's also important for you to understand what you doctor or dietitian recommend in terms of protein potassium sodium fluid and phosphorous levels in your diet. recommendations will vary depending on whether or not you are on dialysis and your labs. make sure you have a good healthcare team to help you out. also see kidney disease: changing your diet good luck!

Question: can a 5 month old have water if they are eating baby food all day and only receives one bottle during the day? . my 5 1/2 month old eats stage two foods three times a day and only gets one actual bottle during the day. i know the rule of thumb is not to introduce water until they are six months old or older but i feel as though he is not getting enough liquids to keep him hydrated. is it fine to start introducing water in small amounts? . just posting the full question here.
Baseline Response: yes, but you should do it on a regular basis. If you don't want to give your child water, you should stop using it immediately. If he is in a hurry or if he is hungry, it's okay to stop and ask for a bottle.
A 3 month old is still under the age of 2 months old. If the child is in the water before 3 months, he is more likely to have diarrhea or diarrhea during the

Expected Response: sure. you can give him water. there is nothing magic that happens at six months and he is eating well and i assume. on formula or breast milk. offer him water. if he wants it he will drink it.
================================================================================
Question: can sids happen if my baby is sleeping at night on my chest? it is the only way she will sleep.
Baseline Response: the way she sleeps is by using a pillow. She will have a lot of room for her body to rest during her sleep, and her breath will remain.
If she is sleeping during the day, she can use her chest for breathing. She may use it to put her feet on the floor or to push her to sleep. This is called a "bed bed". It is designed to be able to move and lie on her chest.
The pillows are also an excellent way to use your chest as a pillow if she is not able to use her arms or legs to move.
What does the pillow cover mean?
It is designed for comfort and it is designed with the purpose of supporting the chest in the right position.
When a baby is asleep, the pillow covers her chest, and this means that she has the right to

Expected Response: no one really knows the cause of sids but statistically it has been linked to babies sleeping on their bellies and babies who co-sleep. if you and your baby are falling asleep with your baby on your chest then you are definitely in the high sids risk catagory. although some babies are more comfortable sleeping on their bellies you should be able to retrain him to sleep on his back in his own crib by utilizing a tight swaddle and being consistent. .

Question: if a new born baby test positive for cocaine does that mean the mother was using throughout her pregnancy? . if the mother used crack in the beginning but once she found out she was pregnant claimed to quit using will the new born still test positive for cocaine
Baseline Response: (I don't know why they would be tested if they were pregnant, but I think that's a good question for parents to ask. If they have kids, they have to be tested. If you have kids they have a chance to be on drugs. If not, you should go and ask the doctor or the doctor's office if they can test your baby.
If you have children, you can have a

Expected Response: drug addicts lie. if the baby tested positive the mother has used cocaine very recently.

Question: i'm sure i have strep throat i'm allergic to penicillins and i think i'm getting better. do i really need meds? . on tuesday afternoon i had a tickle in my throat. w/in 3 hours i had a severe sore throat a fever no energy and swollen nodes the next day. i had white patches on my tonsils but today there is only 1 tiny one left. i haven't had a fever for a day and half i have more energy and feel a little better. do i really need antibiotics (i'm allergic to penicillin anyway) if it seems like i'm fighting it off? i know there can be complications but they're rare and i don't think i'm an "at risk" person.
Baseline Response: yes.
I'm not a doctor but i've been using antibiotics for a while. I've had a very high fever, nausea, and fatigue, i've had severe headaches and dizziness and

Expected Response: it is good that you are recovering. you can start with herbs like tinospora curcuma licorice basil triphala and shunthi powder in equal proportion at dose of 3 gmas twice daily with honey. the mixture can be licked for better results. this combination will help you to increase your immunity. if you have recurrent attacks of sore throat than better get yourself checked up.
================================================================================
Question: what is worse? a laceration or a skin avulsion?
Baseline Response: the lacerations are caused by a chemical reaction in the skin. The skin is covered by a layer of tissue that is covered with a layer, called a skin matrix. The matrix is composed of the skin's proteins and its cells. The cells are divided into a number of subcellular layers called sub-clavicles. The sub-cells are composed of one or more small, transparent pores. The pores are deep and are called a layer. The layers are formed by the skin cells growing into the pores. It is a simple matter to divide the cells into the layers of the matrix.
Source: Wikipedia
Source 2: Wikipedia

Expected Response: that depends on the extent and location (on the body) of the laceration (a cut) and a skin avulsion (a torn off piece of skin). both can be considered serious and both can be considered minor but unfortunately you did not provide any specific information for any medical provider to answer more definitively.

Question: i'm in my late 50's and have implants. my right breast hurts when touched in one spot. should i be worried? . i have not had any injuries to my breast.
Baseline Response: i am in my mid 60's and has implants. i had a nipple cut at age 26. i am now in my 60's. i have implants and have an MRI. i will be looking for a doctor. i would like to see a doctor for my breast cancer.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it can't hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure. while it's likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else. and that's why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain. as you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue. as time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to "pulling" on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself. and of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer. any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts. if you can't see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider. he or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed. wishing you well!

Question: my blood pressure is 222/186 heartbeat 128. i'm 32 female. i know this is really high. how concern should i be?
Baseline Response: i don't want to be a woman. i want to have the best life possible for myself.
i have been in a relationship for many years and this is one of the reasons why i have had so many negative experiences in my life.
I think that the most important thing to me is that i am a human being.
It is not an excuse for me to do anything wrong. i am not saying that i'm not a good person, but i am saying that I am a bad person. i do not want to do what i'm doing.
If i want a relationship and i can't have it, i should start a new one.
The best thing about the relationship is that it has been given to me. i have no regrets about doing what i want.
if i want it,

Expected Response: if this is truly your blood pressure (this actual reading would be very unusual since the top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic) is quite close together) yes i would be concerned. many blood pressure recording devices can give inaccurate readings so please take your blood pressure more often or better yet see a medical provider so that you can be properly evaluated.

Question: is it ok to lay on my stomach if i am 19 weeks pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes, it is.
Do you think the baby will be ok?
Do your friends ask you about it?
Are you going to have any problems with it? How will you handle it? Are you sure you want to have it? Do you think it is ok to have a baby?
How do you feel about it if it is not ok? Do your friends want to help you?
Will you be able to tell if your baby is ok? If so, what is the best way to tell?
I have asked my friend if she would like to see a doctor for the baby. She says, "I know it is very difficult to get a doctor because I am pregnant and my husband is going to need a lot of help. I know there are some things that you can do to help but you need to be very careful with what you do. I am

Expected Response: yes you probably can if you are comfortable. at one point however you won't be able to comfortably be on your stomach. everything is about comfort and discomfort. if you can go for it. if you can't don't do it.
================================================================================
Question: why am i always thirsty?
Baseline Response: because I am hungry. I have eaten a lot of vegetables. I've been a vegetarian for almost 10 years. I don't eat much meat but I've always had a good meal in my life. I'm a vegetarian now. I can still eat a lot but I don´t eat too much. I also don´nt like to eat too many vegetables.

Expected Response: excessive thirst is hard to define. people normally drink varying amounts of liquid depending on their activity level and the temperature indoors and out. there are two main medical conditions that should be considered if you feel constantly thirsty: diabetes mellitus: the common form of diabetes in which high blood sugar levels spill into the urine increasing urine flow. the excessive urination leads to dehydration causing the person to become thirsty and drink more fluid. diabetes insipidus: an uncommon problem in which a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (adh) is either low absent or not functioning properly. adh normally acts on the kidneys to cause them to retain water. in diabetes insipidus the lack of normal adh function results in high urine flow a constant feeling of thirst and high fluid intake. your doctor can test you for these conditions over one or two office visits.

Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 2: Are you sure you want to take a steroid?

Expected Response: the only definitive treatment for a persistent bone spur would be surgery or at least a custom-made orthotic from a podiatrist. i am not sure what kind of steroids you are using (injections? ) but they will not cure a bone spurt. steroid injections can help the inflammation caused by the bone spurs but the effect is only temporary. steroids will not make a bone spur grow.

The best way to prevent a serious bronchococcal infection is to avoid contact with people who have had a chronic disease.

Question: i can't afford to purchase the medicines my doctor has prescribed. can the makers of the medicines help me get them?
Baseline Response: the makers are asking for a donation of Rs 20 crore, but my doctor refuses to do so.
This is an example of how government is trying to prevent the flow of money through the system. I was born in a poor country and I have been forced to move to a poor state. I'm not sure if my parents would support me in my future, but I will get support if I can.

What are the new guidelines?
The guidelines will be updated as the trial progresses.
Are there any changes to the new recommendations?
No changes are expected to be made in the current guidelines. For example, the new guideline for cancer screening for women with breast cancer is now available.
Do the new Guidelines work?
Yes. The new guidelines are intended to help patients who have breast cancer who are at high risk for the disease to be identified as having a high-risk mammogram for the first time.
Can I opt out of the new criteria?
If you want to opt

Expected Response: the primary benefit for reduced mammograms is fewer "false-positive" results. that is the mammogram suggests a worrisome finding when there really isn't one. there are more frequent false positives among younger women (age less than 50). younger women have both more dense breast tissue (making mammograms more difficult to interpret) and less risk overall for breast cancer (risk rises with age). false positives often lead to unneeded biopsies. it should also be noted that 10% to 15% of breast cancers in this younger group are missed by mammograms.

Question: why can't i use condoms as birth control after an endometrial ablation? . my obgyn says no and i either my husband or myself must have sterilization. i am just wondering why condoms cannot be used.
Baseline Response: the only reason we need to have sterilizations is because we have a problem with the disease.
Solution: condoms are a good choice because they are safe.
The problem with condoms is that they can be used as birthcontrol.
If you use condoms, you have to sterilize your uterus.
There are two ways to do that.
1. Use condoms as a birth control pill. 2. Use the other method.
You will find that the other methods are far more effective.
What is the difference between the two methods?
1) The method has a lower side effect ratio. The method also has better side effects than the other.
2) The side effects of the method are mild and can be avoided by

Expected Response: hi after doing some research for you found this on acog. org. pregnancy is not likely after ablation but it can happen. if it does the risk of miscarriage and other problems are greatly increased. if a woman still wants to become pregnant she should not have this procedure. women who have endometrial ablation should use birth control until after menopause. sterilization may be a good option to prevent pregnancy after ablation. a woman who has had ablation still has all her reproductive organs. routine cervical cancer screening and pelvic exams are still needed. the problem with condoms is the can break this will increase the chance of getting pregnant which as you have read is not good for you. so its toss a coin time who goes for the op would be best as i can see and makes sense. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: took a dose of 50mcg levothyroxine can this cause harm? . should i be concerned since it is a natural hormone produced? effects if any it may cause?
Baseline Response: I am not a doctor. I am a medical student. I have been taking this for about 7 years. I feel very safe. I don't have any side effects. I took a 100mg dose of the medication. I was in a coma for about 2 weeks and I was fine. I did take the medication at my own risk. I know I did not have any serious side effects, I just felt very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering from a heart problem. I hope you are safe and happy with your new life. Thank you for your time and hope you find this useful.
Answer, I am very sorry for any inconvenience you may have caused. I will be doing some research on this and have started an online community to educate people. I understand

Expected Response: the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of "natural supplement" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single 50mcg dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information.

Baseline Response: yes. The majority of dentures are worn 24-48 hours a week.

There is no specific specialty. I would like dental services to be affordable, professional, and affordable.
What do you hope to see as you grow as a dentist?
I hope to be able to serve as a mentor to others, help others to become more willing to serve their community, and be a part of the dental community.
Can you give us an idea of how many dentures have been

Expected Response: your dentist or prosthodontist will instruct you as to how long to wear your denture and when to remove it. during the first several days after receiving your denture you may be asked to wear it all the time including while you sleep. although this may be temporarily uncomfortable it is the quickest way to identify the areas on your denture that may need adjustment. once adjustments are made you should remove your dentures before going to bed. this allows gum tissues to rest and allows normal stimulation and cleansing by the tongue and saliva. the denture can be put back in your mouth in the morning.

Question: what kind of skin condition/infection is this? . yesterday an apparent skin infection on my check had swollen half of my face and made it extremely sensitive and sore. i seemed to have brought it down with ibuprofen and ice but the size of the actual bump has not diminished and still hurts. the bump itself looks like a raised inflamed elliptical area slightly over one inch long. the area feels mostly hard underneath while the skin above it feels very dry. what would cause this and should i see a doctor?
Baseline Response: I believe that the skin is inflamed and that the bumps are simply a result of the ibupristone. The skin is also highly sensitive to the hormones that are taking the place of ibuprotic hormones, so if it were not for this, I would be in severe pain.
What are the symptoms of this skin condition?
This skin condition is usually caused by a combination of an overactive immune system and a lack of

Question: can hemorrhoids block a bowel movement?
Baseline Response: Answer
Answer A: a bowel movements can block a movement.
Answer B: a movement can block bowel movements.
(a) A person who has a bowel motion can have a bowel obstruction.
A person who does not have a movement block can have bowel obstruction, which is the same as an obstruction to the left side of the rectum.
Solution:
Solution
A: a person can have an obstruction. A person can be removed from the bowel and then moved to a different location on the other side.
In a small bowel movement, the obstruction is blocked by a small protrusion in the bowel. This can be a small hole.
B: a small obstruction can be blocked.
The obstruction is usually small.
C: a obstruction can block the movement of the bowel movement. This is called a small block.
If a person has a movement obstruction, they can have it blocked

Question: i love oatmeal and i am a diabetic. is it good to eat in a regular basis? . the issue is that i read that some doctors say that oatmeal is alright but you must be careful with it as a major part of your diet but others say it is fine as long as it is not loaded up with all the "nice" things that make oatmeal so good like brown sugar and raisans which makes sense because of the high carbo content.
Baseline Response: it is better to be safe in your diet than to be overweight.

Expected Response: most helpful answer the key for diabetes is keeping carbohydrate intake consistent throughout the day. oatmeal is a healthy carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for heart health and can fit in a healthy diet. you want to work with your healthcare provider on how many carbohydrates you need in a day. the american diabetes association recommends 45-60 grams of carbohydrate at a meal (3-4 carbohydrate servings). one half cup of oatmeal without added sugars contains about one carbohydrate serving (15 grams). if you add to tablespoons raisins that is another carbohydrate serving. the benefit of carbohydrate counting is you have flexibility about what you eat as long as you stay within your recommended carbohydrate intake. but choosing carbohydrates that are nutritous like oatmeal (and other whole grains) fruits and dairy is important for a healthy diet. if you need help see a diabetes educator for more assistance. for more information on carb counting see this article <link> i am a type 2diabetic and eat oats every morning. one of the first things i was taught was to add a good fat or protein to a carb breakfast. i eat 1/3rd cup of steel cut organic oats cooked in water 6 oz. of almond milk 1tsp cinnimon and 1 tbs. of almond butter. i also eat one cup of fruit but eat the fruit 1hr prior to the oats. this wait time allows the fruit to digest before the oats start to digest. i have been taught also to not eat a startch or grain carb together with a fruit as the stomach treats this combination by frementation during digestion. my blood sugars are norml eating this way. total carbs for this meal is around 66grams which is high but eating this way negates the high blood sugars!

Baseline Response: 

Expected Response: i applaud your attitude to this dangerous drug. i would suggest you do a lot of research on the subject. dr. duane graveline's book 'lipitor thief of memory' is a good start: www. spacedoc. com there are a lot of links to other doctors surgeons and researchers who are skeptical of statins.

Baseline Response: yes it will. I am on my second trimester and my cervix is about 1 1/2 inches apart. i feel the pain in my lower abdomen. i know that my uterus is about 2 1/4 inches apart but i can tell the difference between my lower uterus and my upper uterus. i do not know if i should have done this to myself or if i was too scared. if i had this surgery i would

Question: missed the 6th pill in birth control pack? odds of becoming pregnant? . i began my newest pack of birth control on sunday my husband and i had sex tuesday night. i forgot to take friday's pill so i took two on saturday morning. if i wasn't on any type of birth control i would probably ovulate sometime between that saturday and this thursday. i hear that sperm can live between 3 to 7 days. what would the odds be that i would become pregnant. i have been on the same birth control (aviane) for a little over 2 years and have taken them consisently without forgetting.
Baseline Response: I have had my first 3 pill at work and it was the first time that i had had to go to the hospital. i was in shock and wanted to know what was wrong. i had no idea what was going on. i thought it was a virus. i started using it and it worked. i went on

Expected Response: most helpful answer you will most likely be fine and not have an unintentional pregnancy. i can't quote your "odds" since there are too many variables in that equation. if you miss a period then you will have to consider a home pregnancy test or two but chances are you will be fine.

Question: i'm sure i have strep throat i'm allergic to penicillins and i think i'm getting better. do i really need meds? . on tuesday afternoon i had a tickle in my throat. w/in 3 hours i had a severe sore throat a fever no energy and swollen nodes the next day. i had white patches on my tonsils but today there is only 1 tiny one left. i haven't had a fever for a day and half i have more energy and feel a little better. do i really need antibiotics (i'm allergic to penicillin anyway) if it seems like i'm fighting it off? i know there can be complications but they're rare and i don't think i'm an "at risk" person.
Baseline Response: i am allergic to all penicills and I don't know if i can live without them. i'm thinking of going on a diet. do you know what's the best diet for you?

Expected Response: waiting a few days makes sense. a few extra days of employing home remedies should not increase your chances of a complication occurring. i suggest drinking plenty of fluids frequent gargling use throat lozenges to soothe a sore throat sleep with a humidifier and take otc analgesics for discomfort. here are a few additional points: - eventually i recommend that you talk w/your physician about the allergy to penicillin. many folks mistakenly think that they are allergic to penicillin when in actually they were never allergic to this agent or the allergy has worn off. i remember reading that only 20% of individuals with a verified penicillin allergy continued to have a negative reaction after the passage of 10 years from the last dosage taken; - years ago doctors would culture the throat & would have to wait days for sensitivity results in determining if a patient had strep throat and the appropriate antibiotic that would be needed. today in the physician's office a patient can know the results through a swab of the throat and a 10 minute wait period. it may be a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor or medical clinic. that way your throat can be viewed by a medical professional a diagnostic determination probably made on the spot and you can discuss the possibly that you may not be allergic to penicillin. feel better soon.

Question: my doctors office sent my hiv rx to two different pharmacies. i would like to fill both will my insurance pay for both? . i have private insurance (cigna) and my doctor sent my refill prescription to both a private pharmacy and cigna tel drug pharmacy. i would like to pick both up will i run into difficulty with my insurance paying for both if i pick them up in the same week? thank you! i also have an atripla copay assistance card would that help if my cigna refused to pay for one of the refills?
Baseline Response: the insurance company will pay for the refill with a cash amount. This is called a "cignor fee".
1. If you want to use a cignor card, you must pay the cignary fee. 2. If your cignure is not accepted, you may not use it. 3. If the casket is not filled, the cors

Expected Response: it's unlikely your insurance plan will cover the cost of the same prescription in two places within the same general time frame. if you have some other type of pharmacy discount card however you may use that to pay for one of the prescriptions as long as it isn't at all connected with your insurance plan. but it's always best to check with your insurance policy to confirm the specific rules of your plan.

Question: i am on an antibiotic and have very bad diarrhea. i am taking a probiotic and yogurts. can i take another probiotic?
Baseline Response: A: Yes, it is a good idea to take the probiotic as soon as you get diarrhea and feel the stomach is ready to swallow it. It will help you recover. It is important to note that this is not a "pre-diet". It is not an antibiotic. This is a probiotics. It does not contain any antibiotic.
B: There is a lot of information on the internet and it is common to have an intestinal infection. do you have a guide for getting rid of this bacteria?
A, it has been known for years that the bacteria can live in the intestines of people. This has been shown to be a good thing. It can be hard to tell if you have an infection or not, but it is probably true.
The probiotics are not meant to be

Expected Response: it is the antibiotic and usually not yogurt that causes those gi disturbances. some yogurts contain beneficial bacteria. beneficial bacteria in yogurt may be listed on the package with such names as acidophilus thermophilus streptococcus bifidus bulgaricus or lactobacillus. these bacteria may actually help to reduce the negative gi symptoms from the antibiotic. look for those ingredients on your yogurt container even when not taking an antibiotic to ensure that you receive positive probiotic bacteria. many of the leading brands of yogurts contain these beneficial bacteria. if necessary ask your grocery store dairy manager or the pharmacist for assistance in selecting a yogurt with positive bacteria.

Question: is using non-applicator tampons less hygenic than applicator tampons? . i have applicator tampons and non-applicator tampons. i have used applicator tampons (tampax) before but i haven't used non-applicator (ob) tampons. i was just wondering even if you wash your hands before inserting an non-applicator tampons isn't still kind of unhygienic and messy? i just think there might be a lot of bacteria in the fingers and there could be a chance of infections i am kind of paranoid. i just want to know wether it is safe for me to use an non-applicator tampon (ob).
Baseline Response: the only thing that is less hygienically hygient than applying applicator is the applicator. The only thing you can do is use the applicators that you feel are most hygical. I think you could use

Expected Response: either one is fine. this is a personal choice. a healthy vagina is no more "contaminated" than a healthy mouth. it is a good idea to wash your hands before and after tampon insertion.
================================================================================
Question: what is an allen's test?
Baseline Response: a. An allen test is a test that you perform on a specific item to determine if you are successful. In general, you will perform an all-in test on items that are likely to make you more likely to succeed. In some cases, you may perform an ALLEN test on a certain item, but you will not be able to use it as an allin. An ALLEN is a measure of how likely you are to succeed in the test. In other words, you are more likely than others to succeed by performing an all in on an item that is likely to do the most to make it a successful test.

Expected Response: the allen test is used to check the health of the ulnar artery and other vessels in the hand that maintain normal circulation. it's executed by first allowing blood to drain from the hand. at the end blood flow to the hand is evaluated. first ask the patient to hold a clenched fist high in the air. at the same time the main arteries are compressed. by compressing the ulnar and radial artery you allow blood to drain from the hand. next lower the hand and open the fist. once pressure is release color should flow bak into the hand. this indicates that the ulnar vessel is healthy.
================================================================================
Question: can osteoarthritis cause deafness?
Baseline Response: not really. It is a problem that can happen to people with osteoarths, and I think there are many people with the same problem that have had a very long history of it. It's probably not the only one, but it's a pretty big one.
It's not a medical problem, but the problem is that people with this problem can't hear their own voices. It affects the way that the body works and it affects the ability of the body to heal itself.
There is a lot of research that has shown that it is possible to lose consciousness by having an osteoarticular problem. I've seen some people with a similar problem. They have a very strong immune system, and they can't talk. They can't walk. They're hearing loss.
So, there's a lot that needs to be done. But it's not going to be easy.
I've been doing

Expected Response: only if the arthritis is the middle ear bones so most of the time time deafness is unrelated to osteoarthritis (also called degenerative arthritis). the only commonality among both deafness and osteoarthritis would be advancing age. no. osteoarthritis and deafness are aging related disorders. both can appear simultaneously and can be considered related to each other. osteoarthritis of middle ear bone may lead to deafness.
================================================================================
Question: what medication can be used for minor throat and chest pain following endoscopy?
Baseline Response: It depends on the size of the wound. If the wound is small, it may not be necessary to have an endoscopied.
If the wound has a large diameter, it is necessary to remove a small piece of tissue and insert it into the wound area.
You should be able to perform the endoscoping if the wound doesn't appear large.
Why should I care if I am going to have a large wound?
The following factors will influence the type of endoscope you should perform.
The size of a wound: The wound size can affect the size and shape of the endoscope.
How can I know if a small wound is a problem?
You will be asked to write to the doctor.
What if the doctor doesn't know if the endoscopic is working properly?
If you have a small problem, you can report it to

Expected Response: the type of pain you describe certainly is common after endoscopy and i'm sorry you're experiencing it. generally speaking throat lozenges or any kind of hard candy (sugar-free if you have diabetes) can soothe the irritation of the throat after endoscopy. you also may use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (tylenol) ibuprofen (motrin advil) or naproxyn (aleve). keep in mind ibuprofen and naproxyn are blood thinners that can promote bleeding so you may want to avoid those for a few days after your endoscopy. also if you take acetaminophen be sure to follow the label instructions. taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. do not exceed the maximum daily dose. hope this helps!

Question: after taking antibiotic for pneumonia my son is still coughing. is that normal? . he's also still on an antibiotic for an ear infection. will the additional antibiotic help with the cough or will it have to run its course?
Baseline Response: It will help with cough and the cough does not go away. If you need help with your cough, the first thing to do is to go to the doctor. If your son has pneumonia, you need to go and get him checked for pneumonia. You can get him to a doctor if you want to. If he is not there, you will not have to take the additional antibiotics.
Answer 1: if you need more than 1 antibiotic, you can take 1.5 or 2.5 mcg of antibiotics. If there are no other antibiotics available, take 1 mcg.
If you are taking any other antibiotic, make sure that the additional medication is taken within 24 hours of taking the extra medication. If the additional drug is taken

Expected Response: an antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection. however the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time. if it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month i would ask the md. also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough. coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better night's rest for him if he can not cough so much at night. also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the "junk" that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out. i wouldn't worry too much at this point.
================================================================================
Question: what causes testicular pain radiating to your kidneys
Baseline Response: your kidneys are not able to see the blood of testicular tissue, so they are unable to treat it properly. If your kidneys have to go through your kidneys, they are not going to be able to detect the blood coming out of your testes.
Answer #2: How often is testicular cancer diagnosed
Answer 1: Most people have a testicular disease. When they first get cancer, they get a small amount of it. It is a small number, but when you get a larger number, it becomes more serious. Some people get it on the first day of their life.
Solution: you can get an exam at home, but it is not recommended for all people. It may be an appointment for a doctor, but if you are at home and have a lot of testicles, it is better to get an MRI.
The best way to know if you have testicular testicular Cancer

Expected Response: many things: epididymitis orchitis kidney stones testicular cancer. don't try and solve this problem yourself based on internet information. see a urologist and have a thorough examination. testicular pain is not something a man should ignore.

Question: what is the treatment for shingles?
Baseline Response: There is no treatment for this condition. However, it can be treated with some other remedies.
Shingles are a condition that occurs when a person develops shingling in the upper back or upper back. They are commonly seen on children and young adults.
This condition can be very difficult to treat. It is not unusual for shins to develop in children and adults, but there are few effective treatments.
The following are some of the best treatments for shings:
Treatments for shines and other skin disorders:
Shin Treatment
Treatment for shin is extremely important. Shins that are affected by shingle are treated with an antibiotic called dibutyl sulfate (difluoromethacin). This antibiotic is used to treat the shin that is affected by the condition.
If you are having a shingled back, you may be able to

Expected Response: the severity and duration of an attack of shingles can be significantly reduced by immediate treatment with antiviral drugs which include acyclovir valcyclovir or famcyclovir. antiviral drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. other treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include steroids antidepressants anticonvulsants and topical agents.

Question: i am 30 years old. i want to increase my penis size. will dht or testesterone help? other method could be suggested?
Baseline Response: i have a problem with my penis. i have been using testesterones for the last 5 years. i am a young man who has been using them for 2 years. it is very hard to tell if i am really trying to make a difference.
Answer

Expected Response: other than plastic surgery there is no medical way to increase the size of your penis. or your feet. or your head. or any other part of your body. it is what it is so don't waste your money on quackery. an artist is not judged by the size of his paint brush and a good lover is not judged by the size of his penis.

Question: i am almost one year into menopause not sexually active right now. what precautions should i be aware of? . can i get pregnant? is hiv/aids something i should still be concerned about?
Baseline Response: if you have been pregnant for a few years, you should talk to your doctor about your risk factors.
What if i am not pregnant and i want to get pregnant to keep me from having to take antibiotics?
If i am pregnant and are worried about getting pregnant, you can talk to a doctor about the possibility of getting pregnant to get you pregnant.
How much should I take?
Most people who are sexually active need to take at least 2 doses of the drug. These doses are usually more than 2.5 times the daily dose. If you are in a relationship, you may need to have a doctor check you to make sure you have the right level of blood-pressure.
Some women are not sure if they should take their medication

Question: what are the odds of having a partial hysterectomy and then getting pregnant? . this situation was presented to me by a friend 40 year old woman hx of partial hysterectomy suddenly finds out she is 12 to 16 weeks pregnant but never knew. states there is a heartbeat and its a girl. next day she goes to the dr and finds out she lost the baby. there were no previous complaints of pain and or bleeding. how likely do you think this story is?
Baseline Response: I am not sure. I would think it is a good idea to go to the doctor. But if you go to a hospital you will be fine.

Expected Response: it depends on what she considers a "partial" hysterectomy. if she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero. based on the detail of this story i would seriously doubt its validity. another question the person who presented me the story is very distraught over his gf losing this baby they even named her. he was not present for any appts has not seen any labs or ultrasound pic even though she states she had an ultrasound and has seen no positive pregnancy test basically he is going on her word. i hate seeing him hurting like this and the circumstances surrounding are very suspicious. he says she has 2 small incisions one by her bellybutton and one on her left side. is there medical documentation or anything he could ask for to prove her story?

Question: post stent lifestyle reccomendations none have been given to me. after having two stents implanted i was put on appropriate meds as to my individual situation but was never informed as to what lifestyle changes i should do to lessen the chances of further complications i. e. diet exersise etc. is this normal these days?
Baseline Response: i do not know. but i think that it is normal for people to have these types of problems. I know a lot of people who have suffered with diabetes and are not able to live independently. it is not a normal situation for them to have to suffer with the same type of complications.
I also know that if you have been diagnosed with diabetes, you should have a medical examination as to the cause of your disease. I don't think that is a good idea, because it is a very serious problem.
Do you think that this type of situation is something that you should avoid if you are not sure of the

Expected Response: the whole idea of having heart stents done is to allow you to lead a full and active life. it is very common for patients who have had heart surgery to be afraid to engage in normal activities. one excellent way to get back into an exercise program is through cardiac rehabilitation. cardiac rehab as it is often called is a customized program of exercise and education. many programs involve not only monitored exercise but also provide nutritional counseling emotional support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems. if cardiac rehab is not appropriate or possible then discuss your specific exercise goals with your doctor. physical activity is so important for your wellbeing. a physical exercise program should incorporate 4 basic types of exercises. the exercises should include: aerobic exercise muscle strengthening flexibility and balance. an adult should spend at least 30 minutes in aerobic exercise on five or more days of the week. but this is a minimum amount and more is definitely better. the good news is that is doesn’t have to be done all at once. three 10 minute walks are just as good as one 30 minutes walk. depending on your other health issues you will want to pick an aerobic exercise that doesn’t cause problems elsewhere in your body such as your joints. that is why swimming bike riding and walking work better for many adults rather than running. weight lifting is another important part of an exercise program. woman especially benefit by weight training in maintaining strong bones. yoga is a wonderful way to work on flexibility and balance. yoga not only helps with these elements it can reduce your stress levels. but research has shown that exercising alone can’t wipe out the damage done if you sit all day long. humans were not designed to be as sedentary as modern life now dictates. it is important to move throughout the day to be really healthy. obviously diet and weight are also key elements in your recovery from cardiac stent surgery. consulting with a dietician is very helpful in learning to eat healthy. keeping a diary of all the foods that you eat for 3 days or more can also be enlightening. taking off those extra pounds if you are overweight and watching your cholesterol intake needs to be on your program. we know from research studies on obese patients who were at risk for diabetes that losing 5% to 7% of their total body weight delayed and possibly prevented diabetes. diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease as is high blood pressure and small amounts of weight loss can significantly improve your health. you don’t have to look like a model to be healthy. so ask your doctor for specific recommendations to help you on your way to a healthier lifestyle.

Question: what is the first trimester (week 1 - week 12) of pregnancy?
Baseline Response: The first trachea (week 12 - week 15) of the pregnancy is considered to be the first time the fetus is born. The first pregnancy of a fetus is the only time the baby is born to the mother. The second pregnancy of the fetus (week 15 - week 19) is considered the last time the pregnancy begins.
The third pregnancy of an unborn child (week 19 - week 22) is called the "second trimester" of pregnancy.
If the fetus does not live to the second trimester of pregnancy, it will be considered to have a second tracheal site, which is considered a second pregnancy. This tracheum is the opening in the skull, which usually occurs at the end of the first week of pregnancy (i.e. the third week of gestation). If the fetus has a second birth, it may have a third tracheocele

Expected Response: during the first trimester your body undergoes many changes. hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. these changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. other changes may include: extreme tiredness. tender swollen breasts. your nipples might also stick out. upset stomach with or without throwing up (morning sickness). cravings or distaste for certain foods. mood swings. constipation (trouble having bowel movements). need to pass urine more often. headache. heartburn. weight gain or loss. as your body changes you might need to make changes to your daily routine such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent small meals. fortunately most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. and some women might not feel any discomfort at all! if you have been pregnant before you might feel differently this time around. just as each woman is different so is each pregnancy.

Question: could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy? . this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat. but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position. in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease (<link> <link> ). can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful?
Baseline Response: the research on saturated fat has been done on mice, and there is no way to tell the difference. a lot of studies have shown that sf does not harm the heart and that people who eat high amounts of saturated fat are at risk for heart disease. but these studies have not been done.


Answer : I do not know about the other studies that are not based on the studies I mentioned above, but I would like to see a link to one.

.

Answer

Expected Response: most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease.

Question: i tried to push out a mole that was in my skin and now its popping out how do i natural make it go back the way it was
Baseline Response: You have to have a good amount of vitamin E to do this
Answer 1: You need to be able to take a vitamin E supplement
Answer 2: You must be able take a supplement that you have already taken before the acne condition
Answer 3: You can't take a lot of supplements when you are at your peak of acne
Answer 4: You should not be taking a lot if you are having acne on your face
Answer 5: Your skin is too sensitive to vitamin E
Answer 6: You are at risk of developing acne on the face
Solution 1: Use a natural treatment. I used to get my skin covered up with a moisturizer to prevent acne. I never used any of the other products that I used. I have never had acne in my life. I don't want to get that

Expected Response: if you disrupted the skin by trying to squeeze a presumed mole out of the tissue there really is no way to make it go back in. i suggest you keep an eye on this to make sure you don't now develop a skin infection. if you experience localized redness heat swelling or pain or if you develop a fever you should seek medical attention. for future reference it's not a good idea to try to remove skin lesions yourself. never pop pimples "dig out" lesions with a knife or squeeze growths on the skin. for one thing you don't necessarily know for sure what they are. for example what you think is a mole could be a skin cancer. pulling it out of the skin could appear to remove the lesion but cancerous cells not visible to the naked eye could remain behind and delay your getting treatment. hope this helps!

Question: can c6 herniation cause incontinence
Baseline Response: Yes, but it is a very serious problem.
If you have a problem with your vagina, you will have a c6 incontinent discharge. Your vagina is often a bit too big and can cause c6 to leak out of your vagina.
How can I help?
If your c6 is in a tight spot, you can take some regular antibiotics and other medicines to help prevent it.
What should I do?
The first thing you should do is to get your vaginal cramp checked by a doctor.
When you get your cramp, it should be right away.
Get a test tube inserted into the vagina, which should be a small tube that is small enough to fit into your vagina and not too large.
Try taking your cramps as soon as you can, as they are very painful and may last up to a day.
Make sure you are completely clean and dry

Expected Response: no. the nerves from this area go to the arms.

Question: does complete cold interact with any other medications?
Baseline Response: yes.
I have a couple of different versions of the flu shot I take. One is the flu shots for flu season. It has been on my side for about 3 years. I get the flu from my GP when I need it. I also get the shot when I have a cold. I have taken it every day for the last 3 years and I have had no problems. I've never had a flu shot that I could not take. I think that it is the same as the flu vaccine. I guess that it could have been a different shot.
The other version is the vaccine for cold. It is a different one. It was used for a year in the last year of the year when I was in the hospital. I took the flu for about 4 weeks.
Then I took it.
When I took that, I was very tired and I didn't know what to do. I just

Expected Response: abnormal bleeding in late pregnancy may be more serious because it can signal a problem with the mother or baby. call your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any bleeding in your second or third trimester. possible causes of bleeding in late pregnancy include: placenta previa. this condition occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the opening of the birth canal. although placenta previa is very rare occurring in only one in 200 pregnancies it is an emergency requiring immediate medical attention. bleeding from placenta previa can often occur without any pain. placental abruption. in about 1% of pregnancies the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during labor and blood pools between the placenta and uterus. placental abruption can be very dangerous to both the mother and baby. other symptoms of placental abruption are abdominal pain clots from the vagina tender uterus and back pain. uterine rupture. in rare cases a scar from a previous c-section can tear open during pregnancy. uterine rupture can be life-threatening and requires an emergency c-section. other symptoms of uterine rupture are pain and tenderness in the abdomen. vasa previa. in this very rare condition the developing baby's blood vessels in the umbilical cord or placenta cross the opening to the birth canal. vasa previa can be very dangerous to the baby because the blood vessels can tear open causing the baby to bleed severely and lose oxygen. other symptoms of vasa previa include abnormal fetal heart rate and excessive bleeding. premature labor. vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy may just be a sign that your body is getting ready to deliver. a few days or weeks before labor begins the mucus plug that covers the opening of the uterus will pass out of the vagina and it will usually have small amounts of blood in it (this is known as "bloody show"). if bleeding and symptoms of labor begin before the 37th week of pregnancy contact your doctor right away because you might be in preterm labor. other symptoms of preterm labor include contractions vaginal discharge abdominal pressure and ache in the lower back. additional causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are: injury to the cervix or vagina polyps cancer.

Question: do penile pumps work?
Baseline Response: The penile pump is one of the most important steps in making a penile erection. As soon as you insert the pump, the pressure will be raised. The pump will only work on a very small area of the penis. When the penis is fully erect, the penile shaft is called the penis. If the penice is not fully erect you will not feel the pressure in the penis at all.
The penile erection process is a very difficult process. The penis is constantly stimulated, and the penis will get erect when it is not stimulated. It is important that you understand the penian erection process in order to achieve the best results.
To help you understand how to use the penio-vaginal erection pump, we have created a short video of a short presentation of the penioprotective effect of the pump on the penis in a very short period of time. The video explains the pump as it

Expected Response: penile pumps and there’s mechanical devices that you can use those are all good for erection. and they work great. before the days of viagra that was a common operation if a guy had diabetes or a prior pelvic surgery and he couldn’t get an erection and injections didn’t work we had amazing results with penile implants whether inflatable or mechanical. and almost all the men who had those implants were thrilled with them. in the old days you had about one out of a hundred would break and you’d have to go back and fix it. either the pump would go bad or a line would erode or something would go wrong or leak. the newer advances in products are so much better. they not only increase they not only fill length but fill girth and they are far more reliable with rare risks of complications. but with the advent of these new medications out now most men don’t need that. there’s still a need for it and there’s still experts around the world that specialize in that and get great results. but that doesn’t change the length or the width of the penis. it just simply restores the ability for rigidity.

Question: can you be anesthestized before having a urinary catherization. . last week a nurse caused me so much pain that i'm afraid to return
Baseline Response: I was already in a coma for 3 days and still had no symptoms, no pain. I had to go to a doctor and he said my catherizing was a pain in the head and I needed a catherizer. He said it would make me feel better. The doctor told me that my c-c-c+c+C+C didn't feel like it needed a lot of help. He told me my c is a pain like my kidneys and that I should use a c-C.
Answer. I took a couple of pills and was able to get back to normal. I am now in a better place and feel better about the whole process.

Expected Response: are you a male or female? a topical anesthetic like lidocaine jelly can be used to help control the brief discomfort but you certainly cannot be placed under general anesthesia.
================================================================================
Question: are antibiotics safe during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: Yes. The first two studies (and a large number of smaller ones) that have been done with antibiotics in pregnancy found that they were safe to use.
This is because the bacteria in the human gut are resistant to antibiotics. The human gut is an environment that is very acidic. The bacteria in that environment are very resistant to the antibiotic. It is a very dangerous environment for bacteria to grow in.
There are two kinds of bacteria in your gut that are able to survive in a positive environment. They are called Bacteroidetes. Bacteroids live in the gut, they are able find food and they are capable of causing problems in other organisms. This is a really big problem for the human body.
It is also a very important thing for the bacteria to survive. It's not a bad thing. It makes the whole organism a little bit less vulnerable.
The Bacteriotes are very important for the health

Expected Response: certain classes of antibiotics are safe. and when you go visit your doctor they are fully aware of what classes you can be on. if you have any questions though when you come and drop off your prescription make sure you talk to the pharmacist. will be able to double check that information for you if the doctor may have prescribed an antibiotic that maybe you are allergic to when he didn't realize that either. let us know because we'll be more than happy to call them inform them and possibly get the prescription changed to something else.

Question: i have been thinking about buying drugs online to save money is that a good idea?
Baseline Response: i am just wondering what you would do if you could buy a drug online and save money.
Answer - you could use a savings account to buy a few things but there is a huge risk in using a savings bank.
If you are in the UK you should also check your bank's rules and laws.
In the UK, if you are buying drugs from a drugstore or other online drug store, you should be aware of the rules about using a bank savings account. You should also make sure that you have your savings account in place at all times.
There is also the risk that you will be charged for using a drug store in the future.

Expected Response: i would advice this patient that they need to just go proceed with caution. we are finding out that lot of online pharmacies actually take drugs from other countries and send them overseas. so we can't guarantee the products that you get through the internet are really what you think you are getting. so it could be kind of big problem in a small package. so i would highly recommend that if you are going to -- basically what are prescription medications over the internet or through mail-order go through major companies based in united states these are also chains that have stores. we could actually walk into a store and get a prescription refilled and you want to be able to talk a pharmacist you know when you are doing with online you are not going to be able to talk to anybody if you have a question about is it going to interact with my medicine? it's actually a little bit risky. so patients need to understand that the pharmacist is a key person that they need to make sure as part of their healthcare routine the internet is free for some things but not for medications.

Question: nausea vomiting constipation pain in right side of stomach diabetic low grade fever. my fiance has been in the hospital for over a week now. they have done multiple tests and come up with nothing. these are his symptoms: nausea vomiting constipation pain in his lower right side occasional hiccups and low grade fever. he is also diabetic. he goes back and forth everyday. one day he is terribly sick then the next just fine. they have done an endoscopy upper gi small bowel and hida scan. they only thing they have found is gastritis. what could possibly be wrong with him?
Baseline Response: nausea and vomiting constipated. they would not know if they were sick at all. I do not know how many people were affected, but I do know that his symptoms are severe. his doctor has not been able to find any way to help him.

Expected Response: the symptoms also resemble gallbladder kidney or bladder stones; however these should have already been ruled out with a cat scan. my mother (diabetic) experienced something as that which lasted quiet awhile she lost a significant amount of weight during her sickness. doctors were also stunned and diagnosed something as gastritis. researching the web of her symptoms i found that she was probably experiencing an inflammation of the outer lining of her stomach. she was given antibiotics from her doctor which was appropriate however i advised a change in diet until better. her symptoms lasted for several months. the nausea prevented her from eating as she should resulting in a unhealthy weak appearance. there was significant sporadic work loss during that time. antibiotics were prescribed at least twice as i remember. the one thing i have learned of the medical field is that they are forever making mistakes and usually it is good to rely on your own thoughts and those of family and friends. never ever hesitate to get a second or third opinion. if your doctor is located in a small town seek out a professional in the closest large city as the state capital or one of it's size. it seems the most knowledgeable and creative doctors practice in larger cities. one last thought. not knowing more information the thought of an appendix problem popped to mind.

Question: what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?
Baseline Response: the risk factor for ulceration is the type of ulcer that is present in the colon.
For example, the risk for ulcers is higher in people with an ulcer in the stomach.
If you have a small bowel obstruction, the problem may be caused by the ulcer. If you have an ulcers in the abdominal cavity, the problems may be due to a small colon. The risk for the stomach ulcer is higher for people with a small intestine.
What is the cause of a small intestinal obstruction?
The cause of an ulcis is a small ulcer or small bowel infection in the small intestine that is caused by a small bacterial infection (microbiallytic bacteria).
The most common cause of small intestinal infections is a large intestinal obstruction that is not easily repaired by the colonic canal. The most common causes of small bowel infections are

Expected Response: one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.
================================================================================
Question: is it wrong to take antibiotics for colds?
Baseline Response: No, it is not. The antibiotic side effect is not the same as the antibiotic side effects. It is not an issue with the treatment. The problem is that antibiotic treatment is not a cure-all. There are no treatments that will cure colds.
The problem is we need antibiotics for every condition, and it is only when we get the right antibiotic that we will find the right treatment. We have to get the correct antibiotics.
What is the difference between an antibiotic and a placebo?
The difference is that a drug can do some things for you. It can give you a little bit of extra, but you will not get the same benefit as a placebo. It's not a good thing. It makes you sick.
I am not saying that you should get a placebo for every cold. It will be better. But it is a good idea to get some.
Why do you think that

Expected Response: antibiotics are worthless for colds. colds are caused by viruses and no virus responds to an antibiotic. period.

Baseline Response: My wife has a kidney disease. She has taken a high dose of corticosteroids, and her kidneys are still failing. She is in a coma. She will be in the ICU for several days. Please help me to keep my kidneys working properly.

Expected Response: oxycontin is an opiate (derived from the opium plant). morphine is an opiate as well. the test that you took may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between these two opioid compounds. i have read in other sites that these 2 medications have the same properties. oxy often shows up as morphine. i am very lucky that my dr. told me that the test that they are made to do in the dr. office are often incorrect. if my dr. is knows the patient well he will not dismiss someone based on the urine test. these often show up as other drugs. good luck.

Question: lortab makes my stomach hurt and me itch. percocet didn't give me the same problems. what is the difference?
Baseline Response: lortsab is a very effective pill.
Lortsab works on the intestinal lining and the lining of the colon. It is a natural hormone that helps the colon heal. It helps the mucous membranes to heal and to protect against infection. It's an anti-inflammatory and anti-seizure drug.
The best part about lortsabs is that they are not as painful as other drugs. It only takes a few minutes to do and it doesn't take long to get started. It takes about 2-3 minutes for lortsabis to have your desired effect.
What is lortsablush?
Lionsubash is a combination of a natural and a herbal medicine. It works on your gut, intestines and other areas of the body that help you to feel better and stay healthy.

Expected Response: lorcet contains a different pain medication than percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the lorcet. stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food (more of a meal rather than some crackers). i would suggest that you talk to your health care provider about your reaction to lorcet and also let your pharmacist know. they can put a note in your profile about this reaction.
================================================================================
Question: does being hungry all the time subside after a month or two of being pregnant?
Baseline Response: no. The body is very efficient at making the right choices and keeping the body healthy. But when you are pregnant, your body is actually more efficient at developing new organs, which in turn make it more efficient to get pregnant. This makes it more important to have healthy baby parts, which is why we have to be very careful about the amount of food we eat.
Why is it that we get a lot of weight when we have a healthy baby, and that's a big reason?
We're constantly getting fat, and it's a huge problem. When you have a baby, you have to keep your body healthy by keeping your body in shape.
The only way to get fat is to get a healthy belly, and then you have the ability to have a good baby.
It's important that we keep our body in good shape, because that's what we want

Expected Response: while everybody is different that constant hunger that occurs the first few months of pregnancy usually subsides by the second trimester. while appetite is still robust the second trimester it can be satisfied with balanced meals and regular intervals of eating. typically by the end of the third and last trimester appetite decreases as the baby tends to push on the stomach causing early fullness. for more on eating right during pregnancy see this webmd article. congratulations on your pregnancy!

Baseline Response: yes, it is. the lump is the same color as the skin. it has no pigment. it does not come off the skin at all. and it does NOT have to be a normal lump. it can be a lump of any color.
Answer, the lump has a very dark, brown-like color. this is why it is called a "normal" lump.
(a) the skin is darker than the skin that is being treated with a vitamin D. this may be due to the fact that the skin has less melanin in it. the skin cells

Expected Response: as much as i would like to help you it would not be prudent for any medical professional to blindly make such an important call over the internet. it would be strongly advised for you to see a medical professional. someone who can delve into your relevant medical history and someone who can examine this "lump" first hand.

Question: can chiropractic care reverse osteoporosis or scoliosis?
Baseline Response: There are two types of osteoporsia that can be reversed by chiropractors: scolar osteoporosia and osteoposarosis. The scolary type is characterized by osteoposis (the loss of bone) and the osteoporation (the appearance of bone). The other type is osteoporefractic osteopora (the failure of the bone to form or grow).
What is osteosis?
Osteoporiasis is a condition of the skin that causes osteoporesis. It can be caused by a number of causes, including:

High blood pressure or high blood pressure can cause osteoporasis.

Excessive sweating can cause the skin to become irritated.
, and can cause a skin condition called osteoporisis. Excessive sweating will cause the body to become dehydrated.
 and can result

Expected Response: most helpful answer in my opinion chiropractic adjustments will have little or no curative effect on either of these conditions. a child or teenager with scoliosis should be carefully evaluated and monitored by a specialist. a person with osteoporosis should be under the care of her primary care medical provider or orthopedist. this is kind of a "loaded" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find "specialists" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that.

Question: i am an american living outside the country. i am covered by national health care in the country where i live. . how do the new rules affect me?
Baseline Response: the new rule has the same effect as the old. i will be able to buy insurance in the US if i am born in the USA. i have to have a passport, to be able see my family in the UK. the new requirements are more stringent and people will not be able buy insurance unless they are a citizen. i hope the new policy will not affect me. i live in the United States. if you want to get insurance in Canada, you can do it in the states. if your parent is born outside the US and your spouse is born in Canada. i wish i had a Canadian passport, so i can buy insurance from the US.
Answer to

Question: how soon after eating something sweet does it affect your blood sugar level?
Baseline Response: it is a matter of when and how much. The longer the food is in the mouth, the higher your blood glucose level will be.
How long does it take to become hungry?
It depends on your body's health, but the same thing can happen in a meal. A fast food meal has a shorter duration of time than a regular meal. The same goes for carbohydrates.
What is the difference between an "easy" and "hard" food?
An easy food is a soft, plain, sweet, and salty food. A hard food is an expensive, plain food that has been served at a fast food restaurant for many years. The difference between the two is that the harder the food, the longer the time it takes for the body to process it.
It is possible to eat an easy food that is easy to eat, but it is not possible to have a hard

Expected Response: within minutes.

Question: how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?
Baseline Response: osteoarthritic arthritis is a condition that affects the balance of the bone in your body. It is characterized by a decrease in the amount of bone in the joints and the bone that is missing. It can also occur in people who are on the osteo-arthritis medications.
How is osteoporosis diagnosed? It can be diagnosed when your body is experiencing pain and symptoms of osteoarticular joint pain. There are two main types of osteopors:
Disease-related osteoporosietic (DRA) osteopoietic osteopontinomas (OAP) osteoblastomas (OA) osteodontinoma (OAD).
How can I get a diagnosis of osteoborosis?
The treatment is usually called osteoparection. This is a technique to control the amount and the intensity of the pain. If the pain is so severe

Expected Response: there is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis. x-rays of the affected joints can suggest osteoarthritis. the common x-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones and bone spur formation. simple x-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist in decision making as to when surgical intervention should be considered. arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. during arthrocentesis a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout infection and other causes of arthritis. removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain swelling and inflammation. arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. if successful patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. finally a careful analysis of the location duration and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. therefore the presence of heberden's nodes bouchard's nodes and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

Question: can you take nexium and gas x at the same time? . i'm trying to find out the answer quickly for my mom who is suffering gas problems big time and she doesn't know if she can take the 2 at the same time. thanks in advance much appreciated
Baseline Response: i can take both x and gas and get it out of her body. i have a few questions but this is my first time trying to get my ex to take both. can you also take x at once? i have been trying for years to get a second gas so i can try to get it to work again. what do you think about this question?
Answer, i can do both x at one time and gas at the other. i think it's a little difficult to get both at the exact same time because they are different and i just think it helps her to get the gas out of the body faster.
Answer - i can go back to both at one point. i

Expected Response: yes they are compatible medications that can be taken at the same time. they are chemically different and are used to treat different symptoms.

Baseline Response: Hi, I'm an ETS student and I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've been experiencing nausea and vomiting for the last two days, and I feel very sick. I'm going to try to get an ultrasound. I don't want to get pregnant and have to wait for the doctor to give me an ultrasound or I'll be sick and need to get a pregnancy test.

Question: i'm 20 i smoke 2 to 10 cigarettes daily don't exercise eat unhealthy stuff and feel sometimes pain on my chest. my lifestyle is anything but healthy (but thanks to my duties on university i'm fixing almost everything especially sleep-cycles and diet). something i've never thought about was tobacco tho. an uncle of mine died recently (cancer) and i've become a bit paranoid since in the last 2 weeks sometimes i feel pain on my chest. it's not specific and it never has the same intensity (sometimes it's at the ''center'' of my chest sometimes on ''left'' or ''right''). it's never intense. what should i do?
Baseline Response: i'll get to that later. i've been thinking about this for about 2 weeks now. i am not at all worried about this, it's just my body that's making this. i will be honest though. i can't even go to my doctor to see if i need a CT scan. i

Expected Response: i used to smoke a similar amount and would often get pains in my chest on a morning sometimes lasting for a couple of hours. i used to worry about them quite a lot so i quit smoking to see if it would relieve them. the first couple of weeks after quitting the pains got worse but then stopped completely. i've never experienced them since. i'm not a doctor though so i can't say that you are experiencing the same thing as me. but it certainly sounds similar

Question: does a high ths level mean your thyroid is too fast or too slow? . i have graves disease and had my thyroid ablated (i believe that is the correct term) with radioactive liquid. i take sythroid 0. 15mg currently but have had trouble keeping good levels.
Baseline Response: a high level means your thyroid will be too slow or too fast.

Expected Response: i think you mean tsh. thyroid stimulating hormone. basically your pituitary gland is telling your body when more thyroid is needed or not. if this hormone level is low your body is making or getting sufficient thyroid; if it is high this means that your body needs more thyroid hormones.

Question: is it normal for my 2 yr old to scream and cry when i or anyone sings? . on her second birthday i was holding her and i and everyone else was singing happy birthday and she started crying and screaming and slaped me and said no no stop.
Baseline Response: Answer 1:
(3)
Answer 2:
In order to understand why my 2-year old cries when she does so she must understand that it is normal for her to scream when she is in a bad mood.
When a person is in an abusive mood, they cry when they are in an emotional state. If you have a child, if you have an abusive husband, if a child in a relationship, if your child is a young child, you must cry when you are in a negative mood. When a person with a negative outlook or emotional state cries when they is in the mood for a parent, a parent is in trouble.
In this case, when you hear a child

Expected Response: if it is like my family she may be objecting to bad voices but i suspect she just has sensitive hearing and the combined singing voices were just more than she could handle. i don't think it will always be like that for future birthday celebrations.

Baseline Response: (b) I know that clarinet, clarinet and clarinet are different.
[3] The clarinet was made from the same cloth as the other clarinions, but the clarineur was made by a different cloth.
So, I can take the clarion, and the claricet, and i can give the clarilieur and clarine, and then give the other two.
(b) i have never taken clarinet.
I can take clarinet with a claricinet. I can give clarinet without clarinet or clarinet only.

Expected Response: the two drugs are certainly compatible but i don't know anything about you or your medical history to give you a patient-specific "okay".

Question: my 4yr old daughter has red blisters arnd mouth neck ears hands chest and feet. is it hand mouth and foot disease? . she is having cold n cough but not fever.
Baseline Response: i was going to tell you about it but my daughter has a cold n coughing and is not coughing much. i have had one cold n from her, it was a small cough and she has a small fever. she was going back to school for the exams, she went back to home and was still in school. when she got home, she was still on the way to school. she went to the doctor and it was there that she got a fever. i dont know if it was the cough or the cold. she is very sick and she is not getting any medicine.

Expected Response: as you know i have no way of examining these mysterious red blisters over the internet so i am at a disadvantage. hand foot and mouth disease will give whitish papules (look like tiny blisters but are more firm) on the palms of the hands soles of the feet and canker-sore like lesions inside the mouth. what you are describing would not be consistent with hand foot and mouth disease.

Question: foods habit for improve irection?
Baseline Response: It's not as simple as making a good salad.
This is one of the first questions I ask when I'm trying to find the right meal. It's always possible to make the right one for the right reason. The question is, does it work for me?
The answer is no.
So, I will try to answer it in one of two ways:
1. I will answer the first question with a "no" and will only ask about what is the best.
2. I'll ask about the best thing you could do for the environment.
I'll ask "What would you do for a good food?", "Would you take the time to look at the food for yourself?", and "What do you think would be a good way to look for a new meal?",
I will ask about things I think would make the best food for the future, and things that are not quite as good

Expected Response: there are no specific foods that would improve erections but when you life a healthy lifestyle eat well exercise regularly and don't smoke or excessively use alcohol your body will achieve a higher states of wellness; and with that wellness will come healthy erections. erectile difficulties can be very complex and have multiple causes. there may be some underlying medical or even psychological reasons so a consultation with a health care professional would be advisable.

Question: my daughter-in-law is three months pregnant and has sinus drainage and her ears hurt. what can she can do for relief?
Baseline Response: she can wash her mouth with a cloth to prevent it from sticking. She can also put a towel over the ear.
The best way to do this is to get a doctor's appointment and ask her about it.
A doctor can be very helpful for her. If they think she is pregnant, they can ask her if she has sinuses or the ear can be cut off. If she says she has, they may also ask if she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
In the end, the best way for her to get help is to go to a doctor and ask for help. The doctor will be able to give you a prescription and ask you for an appointment.

Expected Response: she would have to speak with her ob/gyn to find out what she can take while pregnant. while some over-the-counter medications are considered safe in pregnancy different doctors have different rules on what they allow their patients to take. along with ob/gyn approved pain relievers a humidifier or a long hot shower may give her some relieve. a saline rinse can help too as well as a salt water gargle. plenty of fluids and plenty of rest.
================================================================================
Question: can all types of hepatitis be spread by sexual contact?
Baseline Response: The hepatitis A virus is transmitted by oral contact. Hepatitis A virus can be spread through kissing or touching someone. The risk of infection from the virus varies by sex.
The most common ways to get hepatitis A is by oral sex, but there are other ways to do this.
To get hepatitis B, you can get hepatitis C through oral sex. Hepatocellular hepatitis A (HBV A) is transmitted through contact with the liver or other organs. Hepatic hepatitis B is transmitted from the liver to the kidneys.
Hepatitis B can also be spread to other people who have sex with men. It is not uncommon for people who are infected to have anal or genital herpes.
Some of the most common infections in the United States are HIV and hepatitis C.
How can you get hepatitis?
The virus can spread through contact, but it is not a very common infection

Expected Response: no
================================================================================
Question: are fillers and botox safe to use during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: Fillings and botany are not allowed during pregnancy as they may cause the development and/or progression of breast and ovarian cancer. Fillings may also be used for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and other cancerous conditions.
Is fillers unsafe to drink or use during childbirth? Answer. Filling and botanus is a non-reproductive condition. Fill, while safe, is not recommended for use for the diagnosis and prevention, and is not approved for use

Expected Response: injectable filling material such as juvéderm restylane radiance and artefill typically do not enter the circulation and therefore it would not appear to be dangerous during pregnancy. understand that the fillers and the wrinkle-softeners botox and dysport are all degraded or metabolized by the body and their end products would not be expected to be injurious any more than any other medication that the mother may be taking. however i am just against any non-essential service being rendered to a patient during pregnancy. in medicine we don’t have 100% certainty as to all the interactions between drugs and the body. so why take the chance?
================================================================================
Question: what’s the difference between percocet oral and endocet oral?
Baseline Response: There are two types of oral contraceptives (or oral contraceptives as they are known in the US) that are considered to be safe for women. Percocets are considered safe for men and women, but not for women who are not pregnant.
Percocetric oral contraceptives are known to be safer for women than endocets and are considered safer for men than endoscopes.
In general, a woman who has had an ectopic pregnancy should not use oral contraceptives. This includes those who have had multiple or more miscarriages.
Many women who have multiple or multiple miscarriages also have an ectopy. The procedure is known as a percococele. Percs are sometimes called percovas, percodes, or percogies, although they are not technically called pericocetes. Pericocets usually have a

Expected Response: endocet is a generic version of percocet. it is manufactured by endo pharmaceuticals and it is an fda approved generic so there is no difference between the two. if you have any questions about generics ask your pharmacist we are happy to help. i think that endocets is stronger than percocets

Question: what's less damaging: smoking 3 cigarettes per day or picking two days of the week and smoking 10 on each of those days? . i know that light smoking still poses significant risks; i know i can still get cancer one day from doing it. so please don't answer by telling me that. i'm looking to significantly cut down in order to lessen the damage i'm doing to myself while still indulging a little in one of my favorite activities. so here are my two options: a) smoke about 3 cigs/day (about 20/week) or b) pick 2 nights/week say two nights when i'm out socializing and smoke about 10 on each of those (about 20/week)?
Baseline Response: i'm not going to try to reduce my risk of cancer by smoking three cigs per day. this is because there are so many health risks to smoking, and even if i could reduce my smoking risk, i'd still be in the same situation i

Expected Response: i wish i could give you a good answer but i don't think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level. in healthcare we measure smoking by the "pack/year. " we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked. for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a "20 pack/year" history. a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week (which calculates to roughly 0. 15 pack per day) for 20 years would have a roughly "3 pack/year" history -- the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years. regardless of the manner in which you smoke (a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period) you're probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures. intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time. rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in. you sound well-informed about the risks of smoking so i'll leave you with one little tidbit. did you know one of the more-common cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer (especially in men)? so the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when you'll be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh. if not then you might want to re-think the whole smoking thing. wishing you well! i wish i could give you a good answer but i don't think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level. in healthcare we measure smoking by the "pack/year.

Question: what dosage of oil of oregano should be given to a 12 month old baby with asthma?
Baseline Response: As you can see from the above images, this is a very difficult question. There is no way of knowing exactly how much oil of each oreganogenic oreganoid can be given in a 12 week period. The first question you may ask yourself is: what dose of oregono should I give to my 12 month-old baby with an asthma condition? If you answer: 1. If you can't get a dose of 1.5 mg of oregene per day, then it is a good idea to avoid using oregonos for the next 12 months. 2. If there is no oregonole in the dose, then you will need to take a dose more than one week before you can do any of the following: 1) take oregones from an allergist. 2) take a vitamin D supplement. 3) take omega-3

Expected Response: i would not treat a 12 month old baby with medically-diagnosed asthma with any oregano. this baby needs to be under the proper medical treatment for asthma not herbs or italian spices.

Question: my 3month old has little cradle cap on her forehead but i notice that its discoloring her skin when some flakes fall off. i need to know will her skin go back to normal or shell have discolor skin forever?
Baseline Response: I can't say for sure.
My 3month-old has little forehead cap on the forehead.
Answer 2: The baby is doing fine.

Expected Response: cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis) will self-resolve in time and should not leave any permanent skin discoloration.

Question: i have all the symptoms of hypothyrodisim and it runs in my family but i also have very tender breasts. is that normal? . they hurt most of the time. i also do have a lump were my thyroid gland is.
Baseline Response: they hurt a lot. but my thyroid is fine. my body is normal.

Expected Response: if you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldn't be a bad idea to get checked out. if you do have hypothyroidism you should be treated for it. breast tenderness generally isn't considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances. some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or menopause and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time. so it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they aren't necessarily in a clinical sense. your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland. hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better. best to you!

Question: my vaginal opening is white color. when i masterbate i notice a slightly clumpy white discharge on my finger. no itching. i am 19 and recently had sex for the first time and had sex about three times within about two months. there is no burning itching or discomfort. the white clumpy discharge has a slight odor. i am mostly concerned about my vaginal opening being white. i thought it might be discharge and tried wiping it but it is the flesh that is white. no bumps or warts. please help.
Baseline Response: my vagina is white and my penis is white due to my vagina having a hard clump of flesh. my vagina does not have a hard vaginal opening, however my penis has a hard, clumpy, white clump and the clump is small. please don't use your fingers to rub the clumps off of the penis. your fingers will be the best. my penis can't be penetrated by your fingers. please contact me at my

Question: what is delirium?
Baseline Response: when we speak of delirism, we mean "the spirit." It means a person who is delorited. It means the spirit of the deceased,

Expected Response: delirium is a form of altered consciousness that occurs in people with medical illnesses or who have dementia. in delirium the person’s level of consciousness and understanding of her surroundings rises and falls. she may be lucid and appropriate for part of the day but be confused and disoriented at other times. people who are delirious may be lethargic and “out of it ” agitated and aggressive or somewhere in between. delirium most often affects older adults and children. infections and medications are probably the most common causes of delirium. people with dementia are more likely to become delirious. treating the underlying cause (such as an infection) is the most important treatment for delirium. antipsychotic medications can be used to treat delirium. re-orienting and comforting a delirious person is also often helpful and may reduce the need for antipsychotic medication.
================================================================================
Question: do vegetarians have more or fewer cavities because they don’t eat meat?
Baseline Response: I do not believe that vegetarians eat more than their body needs.
Answer 1: I believe that it is a good idea to limit the amount of meat you eat.
The answer: I can think of a few other examples of people who have no problem with meat consumption.
One of my favorite is the American Red Cross.
I don't think they would be eating too much meat if it were available to them.
Another example is the Red Cross, which is located in the heart of the United States.
In my experience, they have a lot of vegetarian friends who also eat meat.
There is no evidence that the American diet is a bad thing.
If I were to give the American Dietetic Association some information, I would say that they are in favor of it.
It seems to me that some people who are vegetarian or eat meat should

Expected Response: vegetarians will not have fewer cavities just because they don’t eat meat. eating vegetables or meat does not matter in this process.
================================================================================
Question: does flexeril cause a fast heart rate?
Baseline Response: Yes, flexeri is a protein that is required for the heart to pump blood through the heart.
Flexeril is a complex protein that contains a number of different proteins.
The first three proteins are:
- proteins A, C, and G.
- protein B, C and G
- peptides A, B, and C.
These proteins are found in the gut and are used to control the body's glucose, insulin, and glucose uptake.
In addition to these three proteins, the body also contains a variety of other proteins, including:
Ampirical proteins are the amino acid in the blood vessels and the heart muscle.
Chromatin is the protein that forms the lining of the heart, and is essential for the body to maintain blood flow.
Proteins are the proteins that bind to proteins in the heart and connect them to the blood.

Expected Response: yes it can. tachycardia (rapid heart rate) is listed as one of the more common side-effects although i have to say that in my practice i have not seen this very often. some people on flexeril will get a dry mouth tired irritable or nervous. if your symptoms started at the same time that you started the flexeril there could definitely be a connection so please let your medical provider know so that an alternative muscle relaxant can be considered.

Question: got surgery to remove ingrown toenail & it is looking better; but the area & underneath are turning a brownish color. i am 20 years old & had been dealing with an infected ingrown toenail for a few months. i got surgery to remove the side of the nail a few days ago & it is looking better; however the area & underneath my nail are turning a brownish color. is it infected again or is this part of the healing process or something else entirely?
Baseline Response: the infection is not in the nail at all. It is just in the skin.
Answer 2: I have a broken toenails & the infection was removed within an hour of surgery. it was at the top of my nail & it was very painful & I am very sorry for the pain. I was in pain & was in shock. I am hoping for a better outcome.

Expected Response: as you may know the internet poses an obvious barrier when trying to make a blind diagnostic decision without the ability to examine your toe first-hand. i have removed zillions of toenails in my medical career and yes you can have some areas under the remaining nail turn brownish. this is usually older blood that is being reabsorbed by the body. if your toe is red hot and tender then these would be a sign of an infection. when in doubt it is perfectly fine to contact the medical provider that performed this procedure for post-surgical advice.
================================================================================
Question: are bedbugs attracted to dirty people?
Baseline Response: - They will do whatever they need to do.
Ask them if they would like to help and you will get some help.
If you would like help, you can ask them in the following way:-
- "Would you like to use the bathroom with me?
- If you would prefer to use a bathroom with us, please let us know so that we can get you there in time.
- Please tell me how you would use the toilet with me.
As long as you tell me what you would do with the toilet, you will not be offended.

Expected Response: no. bedbugs are equal opportunity biters -- they’ll go after you whether you are dirty or clean.
================================================================================
Question: what should i do if i suspect an overdose of meprozine?
Baseline Response: I should not take it if it is prescribed by a doctor, pharmacist, or any other health care professional.

Expected Response: if overdose is suspected contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents should call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canada residents should call a provincial poison control center. symptoms of overdose may include: slow breathing slow heartbeat muscle stiffness/twitching hot dry skin widened pupils seizure loss of consciousness.
================================================================================
Question: can amoxicillin be used to treat bacterial vaginosis?
Baseline Response: Amoxicillin is a natural antibiotic. It is available as a drug to treat some bacteria that cause infections. If you have bacterial vaginsitis, it is most likely that you have a bacterial infection. The bacteria can grow on the skin and cause infections, such as cholera. If the bacteria are not present in your skin, you should not use amoxicin.
The following is a list of antibiotics that are used to control bacterial vagitis:
Clostridium difficile, Clostridia difficilis, Clovis difficulans, Clomycin, Clomid, Clotilis
Clovis is the most common bacterial infection in the United States. It occurs when you have an infection that is caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It can also occur when you are infected with bacteria that are resistant to amoxiccin. Cl

Expected Response: no that is not the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis. it would not be likely to help. i am assuming that you are self-treating perhaps using a medication left over from a previous prescription or someone else's meds. if this is the case i would not recommend that you do this. if you want to your vaginitis properly treated it would be best to consult your medical provider so that you can use the right prescription.

Question: wake up with severe nausea and stomach cramps. after having a large unfirm bm the nausea and cramps stop. what is it? . about once a year i get woken up in the middle of the night with severe nausea and stomach cramps. i have to sit on the toilet for hours before any form of relief in the form of a bowel movement comes. the bowel movement is typically large and unfirm (but not diarrhea). once this happens the nausea and stomach cramps stop. i go back to sleep and then get woken up again but it's less severe. the second bm is usually diarrhea. and then i'm better. i'm on no medication. what gives?
Baseline Response: I've been doing a lot of meditation and meditation is one of the most powerful things I can do. The only thing I do that's not really meditative is sit down, I walk around and watch the meditations and I'm amazed at the effects. meditation

Expected Response: sounds like typical diarrhea to me. you should maybe revel in the fact that it's just once a year? you might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things. if it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor.
================================================================================
Question: i had a cold sore once. can this be passed on to my grandchildren if they kiss me or drink or eat after me? . a few times in y 64 yrs when i have had a cold sore. can i pass this to my grandchildren by kissing or letting them drink after me. my physician said i would have to have an outbreak for the children to catch it from me. my daughter doesn't believe it and the babies are always wanting to kiss grammie please help as i feel like they will be fine i kissed my own babies (5 of them) they drank after me no one ever got a cold sore.
Baseline Response: i have been having a cold s sore in my neck for some time now. i started getting sore and started going to the doctor and they said i was getting an infection. i went to the dermatologist and he said i had to get a syringe and he gave me a shot to get rid of the sore. i thought i was sick

Expected Response: i agree with your doctor. herpes simplex (cold sores) are typically only contagious and transmitted during a active outbreak. since millions of people on this planet have latent herpes virus in their system those children will be eventually exposed by someone. a classmate or day-care cohort. most likely sometime in their lives. should they get it it will not likely be from a loving grandmother who just wants to kiss her grandchildren. new parents are worried about everything but this is one virus that is unlikely to come from you. about 50% of the people who get one cold sore will never get another the rest of their lives so should we advise they never to kiss another person? most people like you can have periodic outbreaks but the infrequency of your events show that you have an excellent immune system that is suppressing this virus. my advice for you is to kiss those grandchildren when you do not have an outbreak and my advice for your daughter is to "get real". a grandmother's love cures more boo-boos and i suspect your kisses will be risk-free.
================================================================================
Question: we are planning to attend disney world on vacation. my granddaughter is only 9 months - what are the risks of measles? . she will be flying and attending disney world one day. is this not advisable?
Baseline Response: we will be attending the disney World Festival in January. We will be traveling in a different area of the world. we will not be able to be at the festival because we have to fly. so we will have to go back to our hotel.

Expected Response: your unimmunized child is at risk for measles in any crowd not just disneyland or disney world. she will likely be fine if you do not allow anyone to touch her in the stroller or play with other children. kids like to touch things so if you allow her to touch benches handles etc. places where other children have touched you need to carefully wash or sanitize her hands. you can also wait for disney world until the recent measles epidemic has abated but as far as i know most of the cases are in california (disneyland) not in florida. i don't know when you are planning this trip but you can always check with the local health authorities to see if there are any restrictions or recommendations at the time.

Question: miscarriage at 21 weeks and symptoms after. i had my miscarriage last week wednesday/thursday when i was 21. 5 weeks. i started lactating on sunday. it's now wednesday and it's still going. i am wearing the tightest sports bras i own. does anyone have any insight on how long this will last for? the doctor just told me it would happen but nothing else. . also how long till my uterus fully contracts and my stomach goes back to what it used to be?
Baseline Response: the doctor told me she couldn't tell me anything. so I was told that she would have to see a specialist before she could say anything. she said it was fine and she would be able to say anything she wanted. she also said that she had to talk to the nurse who told her that she needed to be told what she needed.
Answer : my doctor is a very experienced nurse and I was not even sure how long she would take to have

Expected Response: you should stop lactating in 1-2 weeks. continue to wear tight fitting bras and avoid any breast or nipple stimulation. medications to "dry" your milk up are not typically recommended. your uterus will return to normal size within approximately 6 weeks.

Question: are federal government employees eligible for cobra benefits when employment ends?
Baseline Response: yes, federal government workers may receive federal benefits, including a cobra-covered employment authorization, when they are employed as part of a federally funded work-study program.
How does it work?
Federal employees are required to obtain a cobral-covered job authorization by completing an application for a job in the "Job Creation" program, a program that provides federal benefits to employers and their employees.
What is a cobric?
A cobric is a permanent or temporary arrangement between a government employee and a person who has worked as a cobrider for a period of time, usually for a fixed period of three to five years.
Cobra-cobra employment is a position that provides a person with a cobrous employment authorization and a cobrarian employment authorization.
Why is a job for a cobro?
Cobi-cobi employment is an employment program for a

Expected Response: federal employees are not eligible for cobra benefits but they are eligible for a benefit that functions similarly called temporary continuation of coverage (tcc). as is the case with cobra you will be able to continue her current health benefits for up to 18 months (assuming you're leaving voluntarily. involuntary separation from a federal job generally disqualifies you from being tcc eligible). you'll be responsible for paying the full cost of your health plan (your portion and the government's) plus a 2% administrative fee. you can see what those rates will amount to by checking the health premiums page on the u. s. office of personnel management website. to get the ball rolling you will need to fill out and submit to your human resources office a form (2809) for tcc enrollment. you can find the form at: www. opm. gov. you should submit paper work within 31 days from your final day of work but no later than 60 days after your job ends. if you miss the deadline you'll miss out on the opportunity to elect tcc. it's important to note that there is a 31-day extension period after your final day of work when health benefits will still be available to you at no cost. on the 32nd day after regular coverage comes to an end you'll have to begin paying your premium.
================================================================================
Question: can hydrocortisone cream 2. 5% usp be used for scalp psoriasis?
Baseline Response: yes, we can use hydrocertin 2.5% usps.
I've heard that the best way to get your psoradiation started is with a topical cream. You can also use a cream that is a little bit more hygienic and less irritating. The main reason for this is that you need to use a little more water to get the cream to work.
What are the best topical creams for psoradic acne?
The best topical cream is called Hydrocortic. It's a cream with a very high pH, so it's very hygified. It will give your skin a little amount of water and it will help to get rid of your acne.
How does hydrocartifol work?
Hydrocartiferol is a very good topical cream because it's a hygiven

Expected Response: yes but it will make your scalp appear very greasy. psoriasis often takes stronger topical steroids than hydrocortisone however.

Question: most of my bowel movements are hard pebbles most of the time i use a rubber glove on my hand to get the stool out why. i eat a lot of fiber and have used senocot and miralax without much relief i also have pain in my groin area that affects my walking sometimes. i have been having this problem for a few years i also have gerd and take protonics for that. what can i do?
Baseline Response: if you can see the stools you can make a stool out of a towel or a cloth and start cutting them to make a bit of stool. If you have a large bowel movement or your hand hurts you can get the stool to fill up with water. the stool should be small enough to fit in the toilet and it should be very large to fit into the mouth of the toilet. you can do this by stretching the stool with your fingers, but it's a lot more fun and it's much easier if you

Expected Response: i certainly think you should see a doctor about this. what you're describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass. this possibly could cause a bowel obstruction eventually. it sounds like you've done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives. you should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay well-hydrated. some medications for acid reflux can cause constipation so be aware of that. your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if there's something else going on. either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements. best wishes to you! i have not experienced what you are going through. but i did have anal fissures leading to bleeding. also hard stools. here is what worked for me: i have boiled okra regularly for dinner as part of my diet. spinach (indian recipie for plain palak) 1 apple a day dried prunes in office for munching (about 5 to 6). atleast two liters of water every day almond oil with warm(or hot for me) milk after dinner. and important: walking 30 mins a day if possible before the first visit to the toilet int he morning. i never buy ebooks but i bought this one and some of them helped me: <link> ebook pdf is called: constipation help i'm not saying this will cure your condition which looks a bit further away from where i was. but these things in my diet helped me. from what i experienced once you have this situation its better to see what foods you eat and make a regular schedule. disclaimer: i only told what i faced and how it helped me. im not a docotr and have no medical knowledge. i also cut out coffee entirely from my diet. hotchoclate. for me. those led to hard stools
================================================================================
Question: could there be a connection between pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis?
Baseline Response: There is not a link between pycystic acne and osteoarthritis. It is possible that pycysts may cause a change in the number of bone cells in the body. It's possible that this changes the number and intensity of osteoporosias, and may have a role in the development of osteoarticular cancer.
The study of young men who underwent pycystectomy is difficult, and in most cases is not representative of the general population. However, the risk of osteogenic osteopterygia is much greater for men who had been treated with corticosteroids.
What are the benefits of pycychostosis? What are the risks?
There is a very good information about pycycle and osteogenesis in the literature, and it is important to have it carefully considered.
This is why it is recommended that patients with

Expected Response: both pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis cause brittle bones. however pycnodysostosis is a disease with abnormally dense bones whereas osteoporosis is exactly the opposite a disease with washed-out porous bones. there would seem to be no conceivable connection between pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis. the new findings about cathepsin k and pycnodysostosis have made it clear that cathepsin k is a major protease in bone resorption. given this function it may well have a role in osteoporosis. cathepsin k may in fact provide a rational basis for a new approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. this is an excellent illustration of how research on a rare disease may bring benefits to those affected by a common disease.

Question: can you wrap poison ivy in gauze so not to spread. its on both arms and its hard to not touch it on things can it be wrapped at night while i sleep and for how long can it be wrapped
Baseline Response: if you're wearing a silk hat, you can wrap it, but if you have a button on your hat, it can't be wrapped.
Answer to question: what about a cloth bag.

Expected Response: poison ivy on the skin is not contagious. it will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person. it can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later. assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead. it is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions. it does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained.

Question: just began tamiflu-current fever 103. 5. 10yr old. acetaminaphin ok? (tested positive with nose swab)
Baseline Response: it is.
I have had it for 5 months and have never had any problems. The only thing that is wrong with the acetaminophen is the acetyl-l-carnitine (Carnitin) that is being used. If you have a history of heart problems you should check for it. I would recommend taking it every day and every other day, but if you have any other problems, try a different acetaminoplastin.

Expected Response: i am not a doctor but having raised four kids and now my eight year old grandson i may be able to guess an answer here. if i remember correctly any time a fever is over 101. 0 the body needs help to fight the fever. anything under that number you usually want the body to fight it off itself. it is a very good idea to give acetaminaphin espically if the fever is that high. you can give tylenol. and three hours later give advil . and so on. good luck.

Question: right now i have no insurance and patient assistance pays for my 388. 00 a month medication. how much will i have to pay for it on the silver plan?
Baseline Response: i am pretty sure i will need to buy insurance for 4 months. I will need insurance from my plan if i want to pay more than 2 months for my medication.
I am using my new 401k for my first 3 months and i have been paying for 2 months in my plan. i can't afford to

Expected Response: you may be able to continue getting assistance with your medications. the law won't stop prescription drug programs. however all health plans sold through the marketplaces must cover the cost of prescriptions. and if your income qualifies you for subsidies you may find that a big chunk of the cost of your medication is covered through the plans available to you. the only way to know for certain is to shop your options. in new york the online marketplace is called new york state of health. here's the link to the website where you can begin to compare health plans: <link>

Question: if i took pseudoephedrine for what i thought was a sinus headache can i take acetaminophen too?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure what you mean by "prescribed" acetaminopa.
I'm not aware of any studies on this. I'm aware of studies on a range of other substances and they all suggest that using acetaminopropyls is better than using a prescription drug.
If you take prescription drugs for an acute headache, you will get a headache. If you take acetamine or acetaminopeptides, you won't get a migraine.
It is possible to take acetamides at the same time. But if you take it in conjunction with a prescription, you can't take it at the exact same time or in the same dose. So, you must take it before or after the prescription is given.
The reason for this is that acetaminoses are usually not prescribed at the time of the headache.

Expected Response: yes it is fine to take both acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine together in fact that may be very helpful for a sinus headache. hope you feel better soon!

Question: does gallstones cause urinary problems. smelly and cloudy ursine that comes and goes
Baseline Response: no. gallstones are not a sign of urinary tract problems. They are an indication of a problem that can be easily remedied by using a urine test or by taking antihistamines.
In the United States, gallstones may be a serious health problem. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that gallstones can cause urinary tract infections, including:

fever

diarrhea

dizziness

skin rashes

inflammation of the anus

nausea

sore throat

migraine

severe abdominal pain

or

trouble breathing

In addition, gallstone can cause:
. aching or redness in the throat
. abdominal pain that can last for several hours

. pain in the stomach

 . aching in the legs

Expected Response: no gallstones and urinary problems are not medically-related. a person can have both you know.

Question: how can i overcome feeling so nervous when i play my flute in band? . there's this one song that we play in band and the flutes have a huge solo in it where we're the only ones with the melody. everytime i even. think. about playing that part in the song i flip out. when we play it in band i shake so bad my notes come out shaky i get sweaty my heart beats very fast and i can barely play because i am so nervous. this happens all the time even if it's just a really short section of playing. last time we played it i got so nervous i almot got up and walked away.
Baseline Response: i was thinking about this one part of the song and when i started playing it i was like, "wow this is so great. i wish i had played that part before" but then i got scared and i didn't want to play it. so i asked the band manager for the song so he

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. stage fright can be a terrible thing! first i want to point out that even though you feel extremely anxious the fact is you are playing the song. sure your notes might be a bit shaky -- but you're probably the only person who notices that. you should give yourself a pat on the back for getting through the performance and have confidence in your ability to do this. if it helps at all please know that many famous performers confess to having stage fright. in fact the hugely successful singer adele recently said she often feels "scared (i'm) not going to be able to deliver. " i doubt your performance anxiety requires medical treatment. if possible talk to your music teacher or your fellow performers about this. i bet you'll find they also feel nervous about performing. sometimes just knowing you're not alone is helpful. best wishes to you and remember you can do it!

Question: can you use vicodin to help ease alcohol withdrawl
Baseline Response: vicodine can help you manage alcohol withdrawal. You can use it to relieve withdrawal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat. You may also use it as a sedative or to help you sleep better.
The following are some examples of how to use vicodynicin.

Baseline Response: I am currently planning on a plan with a deductible of $2,000 for an abortion. I have not yet decided whether to offer a plan or not.
The current plan does not cover any of the following:

1. I plan on paying $1,000 per month for a abortion.

2. I'm currently planning to have a pregnancy test at 6 weeks.
. I am not currently planning any more abortions.
If you are considering a pregnancy testing plan, please read the policy.
Why I'm leaving Planned Parenthood
I am leaving Planned Church of Christ in the hopes that the church will allow me to continue to serve in the health care arena. I will be leaving because of the tremendous love and support I have received from people

Expected Response: for those concerned about maternity benefits including labor and delivery most health plans will have to cover these benefits beginning in 2014. the one exception is if your coverage is through a "grandfathered" employer plan. some of those plans may not have to add new coverage for labor and delivery right away.

Source for this quote:
"No medical studies demonstrate that methidone may be ineffective for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS. No scientific evidence indicates that this therapy is safe, effective, or effective in treating

Expected Response: the short answer is: no it can't. if i understand your question correctly you're asking if the drug methadone can be transmitted through bodily fluids from a person who has taken it to a person who has not taken it. this is not possible. in fact it's not possible with any drug whatsoever. in other words you can't get high from methadone or develop an addiction to methadone by having sex with someone who takes the medication. i hope that clears things up for you.

Question: my gf's period is late over 10 days now. we did have unsafe sex after foreplay like 3 mins and wear condom. pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes.

Expected Response: two weeks before her due date is her most fertile time. foreplay would have caused arousal for you and there would be leakage of pre-ejaculate. those 3 unprotected minutes could have released small drops of sperm before you put the condom on. my verdict is - she's most likely pregnant.
================================================================================
Question: can you tell me whether environmental facial damage can be repaired without doing laser treatments?
Baseline Response: yes, if you have already done a laser treatment. The laser can do the same thing. However, the more you have done the laser, the worse it looks, and the more it will do. You have to be careful about what you do, and that can be done in a laser.
Why does it matter if I have to do laser treatments for a long period of time?
Because you can't just give up, and you can only get the results you want. If you want to do the treatment for a few days or weeks, you have to go through a series of different laser treatments. The more you do the laser treatment, the longer it takes to get the result you want, and then you have the risk of permanent damage.
What can I do if I can't do the treatments? You have one option: to go to a dermatologist, or

Expected Response: skin damage that is secondary to environmental changes -- such as from the sun or harsh weather conditions -- can be treated with topical tretinoin alpha-hydroxy acid (aha) or glycolic acid and hydrating compounds. severe conditions will dehydrate your skin cells and rob your skin of essential nutritional elements. in order to combat theses unwanted changes your skin care regimen should be designed to rejuvenate rehydrate and stimulate new healthy skin growth.

Question: help. i have what i can say are wart's on my fingers "honey goo comes out of them. what do i have just warts?
Baseline Response: I have warts on my finger
Answer 1: I got a wart on my wrist.
Answer 2: I was told that my finger was infected with a wart.
Yes: I get a wart from my finger.
No: I am not infected.
I am not in the mood to go on the internet and buy my own wart treatments.
In fact, I have to buy my wart treatments from a health care company that claims that it is safe to use.
They are not.
Now I am ready to talk about the issue of wart removal.
Warmup is a very important part of a healthy lifestyle.
It is a crucial part of our daily routine.
So let me give you a little bit of background.
One of the most common causes of wart

Expected Response: warts do not have "goo" in them; they are solid masses. i would question the diagnosis and consider dyshydrotic eczema as a possibility (especially if these bumps tend to itch).
================================================================================
Question: strong smelling urine. i had a mild urinary tract infection about 2 weeks ago with all the burning and discomfort but that went away but my urine still has a strong odor is that a sign i still have the infection?
Baseline Response: yes
Answer : no
Answer is an example of how the body makes changes and sometimes changes in a patient's lifestyle. In the case of this patient, her doctor decided to take her to a medical clinic for an antibiotic check up. She was given a urine sample and she had a complete urine test and found that she was not getting any new infections. She also had a urine test which confirmed that she is not infected with the flu.
It is important to note that this is not a cure for the flu, and if you have the flu it can cause serious problems.
I am not a flu expert, but I have done some studies that have shown that if you are infected with a flu, the flu virus can cause problems for you.

Expected Response: hi if you uti went away without drugs then that was a good thing but your strong smelling urine may just be from not drinking enough through the day along with what your drinking daily try drinking a two litre bottle of spring water daily this should help flush you system out and flush away you smelling urine. good luck
================================================================================
Question: will clindamycin hcl treat a bladder infection?
Baseline Response: Yes. Clindamycin will not cure an infection.
ClindamyCin is a powerful antiviral.
The following is an excerpt from a blog post from August, 2012.
I'm writing to say that I've found clindamicin to be a great antiviral agent, and that it's an easy, easy, and very effective treatment for the most common bladder infection that I know of.
However, I do want to stress that this is a very limited group of patients, and there are many more who may need to receive this therapy. So if you have any questions about clindamcin, please feel free to ask.
As I've mentioned before, clindams are not effective for the majority of patients. However, you can use clindamine for more serious problems, such as:
Anorexia, Crohn's, Crojnj

Expected Response: if you're thinking about self-medicating don't do it. have you been diagnosed with a "bladder infection " or did you self-diagnose this? if a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection. as you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections. an antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected. when a person decides to self-diagnose and self-medicate they do themselves a grave disservice. in taking a "leftover" antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment. this can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications. if you believe you have a urinary tract infection (much more likely than a "bladder" infection) i suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center. they will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic. many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a uti or bladder infection. even if you'd had a uti before do not assume you "know" that's what's causing your symptoms. only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract. wishing you well!

================================================================================
Question: what are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?
Baseline Response: I have not been able to find any definitive evidence of bacterial infection in the vagina. It is very difficult to determine the exact cause of the infection, but it is possible that it may be caused by a bacterial vagus infection.
The symptoms of bacteria vaginitis usually start to appear after about a week or so after a tampon. It takes a few days for the bacteria to spread from one part of the body to another. The symptoms of this infection are often accompanied by vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, and loss of appetite. The vaginal discharge is often accompanied with pain.
In some cases, it is difficult to tell what caused the infection. The infection usually goes away after about 6 weeks. The vagina may also develop a rash.
Symptoms of bacterial vaginal vaginism are similar to those of other vaginal infections. Symptoms usually start in the first week of the menstrual cycle, and then spread to

Question: is it better to wash your face before you exercise and sweat?
Baseline Response: yes.
How often should you wash your body after exercise?
How much should you rinse before you get to work?
Do you have a special diet for the week or does it depend on your body?
The answer is yes. The best way to clean your face after exercise is to rinse your face with water. If you have oily skin, it is better to rinse before your workout. If your skin is red, it may be better to have a soap and water before your exercise. If not, rinse your body with your soap and rinse your skin with your water.
What is a "cleaner" face?
A clean face is a face that is clean and has no problems with wrinkles, wrinkles or blemishes. It is a very clean face that does not have any problems with the appearance of wrinkles, blemish or wrinkles.
A face that has no wrinkles

Expected Response: no i dont think it's wise to do this especially if you wash it with hot/warm water-- leaves the skin dry.
================================================================================
Question: it it typical for knee pain and swelling to be associated with strep throat?
Baseline Response: it is common for those who have strep disease to experience symptoms similar to those of strep.
This is an important part of the treatment of streptococcus pneumoniae. The reason for this is the fact that strep is the most common cause of infection.
There are two types of streps that cause strep: the common and the rare.
The common streps cause severe symptoms of infection such as soreness, pain, itching and discoloration.
Common streps are not the same as strep infections.
Symptoms of strepd
Common and rare streps include:
- achy, painful, sometimes painful, and often difficult to control
- infection that can lead to infections such as pneumonia
- recurrent or recurrent infections, such as strepel
- infections that can be controlled by antibiotics
Common & rare strep are not all

Expected Response: most helpful answer no. it is not typical. strep has the potential to cause rheumatic fever including joint infection so i would strongly suggest that you contact your medical provider regarding these new symptoms.
================================================================================
Question: what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?
Baseline Response: the risk of colorection is not the same as for other types of cancer. In fact, there are three risk factors that are associated with the risk for colitis: a) inflammation, b) inflammation-related changes in the blood-brain barrier, c) a decrease in the immune system, and d) a decreased risk for developing diabetes.
This is a very simple question. There are many factors that contribute to the risk.
In general, there is no single factor that is linked to colitis. This is because the risk is different for every individual.
For example, the risk that you will develop colitis in the first few years of life is much higher in women than in men. Men have higher risk factors, but women have lower risk factors.
Another reason why women tend to have higher colitis risk is that they are more likely to have multiple genetic factors that cause the

Expected Response: regular physical activity protects against crc. we can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against crc. statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect crc in a positive way. postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the women’s health initiative study to reduce the incidence of crc. dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin b6 all have positive effects in reducing crc. and non-herbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against crc. antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. but the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant. drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a person’s life risk for colorectal cancer. if a person’s body mass index (bmi) is over 25 there is a 1. 5 fold increase in their risk. researchers also noted an increase in incidence of crc and death from crc if a person smoked. and in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics the risk of crc was 30% higher for the diabetic group. another factor that increases a person’s risk for crc is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease. inflammation throughout the gi tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against crc. finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor. if you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance.

Question: why do i have an extreme urge to have a bowel movement when i am faced with scary/fearful situations? . (e. g). imminent danger fear for a loved one misplaced keys etc. or even loud phones
Baseline Response: You can tell by the number of times i have had this urge to put on my clothes. It is not a "natural" urge to wear a shirt or a pants. It can be a part of a larger conscious state of mind that is being triggered by the moment of fear or the need to put a shirt on.


A few times i've had this feeling of being unable to put my shirt on when i need it the most. i know this is not normal for me but i have been told it can be because of my body's fear of something bad happening to me. It's also not a natural state of thought or feeling.




I am not a normal person. I am not afraid of anything. I

Expected Response: i can't really answer that question as to why you do this since each persons' response to danger or scary situations would be different. some people scream. some faint. you take the chance of soiling your pants. what concerns me is this reaction when you hear a loud phone or misplace your keys. this is not normal so i strongly suggest that you see your medical provider first to make sure there is nothing physically wrong and then see a good counselor to help you better control this reaction. in the meantime it would be wise to avoid these stressful situations

Question: my cat's claw got stuck in my upper lip and caused an infection. how can i get rid of the round pinkish scar?
Baseline Response: I used a small piece of paper and poked the paw through the plastic. I used it to wipe the scar off the paw and then rubbed the paper over the hole. I then took the paper off the paper and put it in the back of my cat and started to eat it. It is very easy to clean the cat with the paper.
Answer 2: I am having trouble with my cat. I was told that it is not a problem and that I am in good health. I did a little research and found that there is no need for a "feline-skin-in-the-mouth" treatment. It does not appear that my cat is allergic to cats. I am very happy to help.
Thank you for your time.

Expected Response: the development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cat's claw pierced the skin of your upper lip. unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same. with time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable. one thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin e-based oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar. if it really is a problem you'll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options.

Question: what is a good basic skin regimen for improving acne?
Baseline Response: the only way to be sure is to use a combination of moisturizing formulas.
What is a sunscreen?
What are the different types of sunscreen? What are the differences between sunscreens?
This question is an easy one. I am a fan of the term "sunscreens". It is easy to think of a good sunscreen as a sunscreen that helps protect you from ultraviolet rays and UVB rays. In my opinion, it is not a sunscreen. It is an essential ingredient in most sunsculpting products. I have always thought that sunscreen is a very important ingredient in skin care. It has always been my favorite ingredient.
I believe that sunscreen has to be a good foundation that protects your skin from UVB radiation. The best foundation is a foundation that is made with sunscutting ingredients. The only way that you can avoid exposure to the sun is to avoid using sunscreen.

Expected Response: exfoliating your skin helps to get rid of the dead skin cells and encourage cell turnover which brings healthy skin to the surface faster. if you're acne prone be gentle. over exfoliating can cause more breakouts. - the vein care center

Question: is it harmful for a female to become extremely sexually aroused if she cannot reach orgasm due to medications?
Baseline Response: It is harmful to become aroused by medications because they can affect the sexual function of the female.
I would like to mention that this is not a medical condition. I am not a doctor. I have no experience with it. I think there is some difference in the way a doctor treats patients with sexually transmitted infections.
A female should be able to orgasm without medication and that is why it is considered a medical problem.
So, a male should not be required to have an orgasm if he cannot reach his orgasm.

Expected Response: i would say no it's generally not harmful to become sexually aroused without orgasm. many woman have trouble reaching orgasm even those who take no medications at all. i'm not actually aware of any medications that block female orgasm so i wouldn't be too sure your inability to climax is related to a particular medication. of course if you have a heart condition you should be cleared by your physician for sexual activity. sexual arousal can raise blood pressure which can be bad for your heart if you have existing heart disease. if you have concerns about your sexual health please do not be reluctant to discuss them with your health care provider or a counselor with expertise in these issues. i can assure you any health care professional worth his or her salt will treat your concerns and questions with the respect and dignity they deserve. hope this helps!

Question: is tabacco residue on clothing harmful to infants. my girlfriend is pregnant and i am a smoker everyone knows 2nd hand smoke is harmful to everyone. my question is; is tabacco residue on my clothing harmful to the infant. (example-if i smoke at work then go home and hold the baby is the smell physically hurtful to the infant)
Baseline Response: no.


The point of tabacco is that it is a substance that is highly toxic to the fetus, and that it can be used in the body. The body is a great tool for the body to use chemical compounds, such as the smoke or other chemical substances, to produce the same effects. It is the body's natural defense mechanism. The fetus is not exposed to a substance of this nature and will not react to it. It also does not react with any chemical substances that are harmful to human health.

The body uses the chemical compounds to create chemical bonds that make it more durable and more

Expected Response: not the smell but the carcinogen (cancer-causing) residue that may be on your clothes or skin. this is called third-hand smoke. before you hold this little infant take a shower wash you hair and change your clothes. and. if you have plan on having a meaningful contact with this child as it grows you had better stop smoking now so you will be around to enjoy this new life.

Question: if i take tylenol pm and tylenol arthritis pain am i taking too much? what is the limit for acetaminophen each day?
Baseline Response: acetaminol is not a medicine for arthritis. It is a medicine that can relieve pain, relieve the symptoms of arthritis, and help you heal. Acetaminol has been shown to work in the treatment of pain in many different forms. It works by increasing the level of acetylcholine in your blood. This is important because acetaminoline can be used to produce pain in other areas of the body, such as the kidneys and liver. The first step in treating arthritis is to take a pill. This pill will help you to relieve the pain and pain you are feeling. The pills can be taken for as little as five days a week. You can take acetaminola or acetaminodil as long as you feel well and your pain is mild. If you feel fine, you can take a nap

Expected Response: recently there has not been a new limit established. we are still using the guidelines of 4000 milligrams a day if you are an adult and 2000 milligrams for an elderly adult. now tylenol pm does contain some tylenol and it contains also benadryl to help you sleep. arthritis tylenol i believe has a higher amount of tylenol so you want to be really careful about how many times you take it a day. come and talk to your pharmacist. we will be able to sit down with you and discuss how many milligrams you might be taking with the one product and then in the evening product the tylenol pm. and figure out how much you are taking on a daily basis. we might ask you to take not as much of the tylenol arthritis product because you are hitting that limit each day. so be really careful come and talk to the pharmacist bring your list of medications because you may not have been aware that some of the prescription medications that you are on may also contain tylenol. that is the reason why it's been in the news because people were taking prescription medication that contained tylenol along with additional over-the-counter tylenol products. so basically come and ask the pharmacist is the medication expert we are a resource for you and we are here to help you.

Question: can i give my 2-year-old children's benadryl and robitussin cough syrup together?
Baseline Response: yes, it's a good idea to give it to them. It's not a big deal if they're allergic to benadrys.
The only difference between a benadyleth and a benadecene is that it's an alkaloid. It doesn't have a lot of active ingredients, so you can use it in a lot more than you can in a benaidryl.
How to make a benadaide
If you're making benadyl ester in a jar, you'll need to mix a bit of the benadrol with the benade cetyl. This will give the benadorate a little more sweetness. You'll also need to give a bit more benadrine.
If the benamine is in a liquid like water or vinegar, then it's easy to add it.

Expected Response: children’s benadryl contains diphenhydramine and is labeled for use for children aged 6 and older. children’s robitussin is available in a variety of different formulations but may contain guaifenesin dextromethorphan and/or phenylephrine. children’s robitussin is labeled for use for children aged 4 and older (and in some products aged 6 and older). while it is safe to take both the children’s benadryl and children’s robitussin together i would not recommend these products for your child based on her age.

Question: do certain fruits boost fertility?
Baseline Response: Yes, in certain ways. In particular, the fruit that is most abundant in fruit trees is called "sweet" fruit. Sweet fruit is an essential component of a healthy diet. Sweet fruits are the most commonly consumed fruit in the United States, and the majority of fruits are sweet.
Why are fruits sweet? In the United Kingdom, sweet fruits are more common in fruit pies, cakes, pies, and ice creams.
What is the difference between the sweet and the sour?
The sweet is the type of fruit that your body produces. It is the most common type of food that your digestive system produces.
The sour is the fruit you eat when you are sick, or when you're not feeling well.
How can I know if my fruit is good for me?
You can tell by your fruit. When you eat your fruit, your body is constantly producing nutrients. This means your body uses your body's own

Expected Response: not really. there are so many different medical reasons that can account for fertility problems that it would be impossible to solely attribute nutritional deficiencies as the main culprit nor suggest eating an abundance of certain foods to enhance conception. there are no "magic bullets" when it comes to fruit. fruit is an important part of a healthy balanced diet. rich in micronutrients vitamins etc. eat the fruit that you like and make it a integral part of a healthy lifestyle

Question: what surgery options do i have for bipolar disorder?
Baseline Response: I have been thinking about it for some time, but I have no idea what to expect. It's not something I would want to wait for. I'd rather get some sort of treatment, like a physical therapy session, than wait for a diagnosis.
I am still on medication, and I'm not sure what my options are right now. I've been thinking of trying to get some help from a psychiatrist, but that's not going to happen.
What if I don't have the answers I need?
I don't know if my current treatment is working, but it's not like I'm going to get into a serious fight with my mental health. I have to deal with my issues with my husband and my mother.
Do you have any advice for those of you who are struggling with bipolar disorder and want to get help?
If you're struggling with an illness, ask your doctor or psychiatrist

Expected Response: there is no known surgery at this time to treat bipolar disorder. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Baseline Response: it is not a problem. if you want to find out more about your condition please contact our clinic.

Expected Response: well hi 123 we meet again sounds like it could be over use if you can just stick with your vibrator inside your vagina for a couple of weeks give your poor clitoris a rest and with lubrication like coconut oil but just go slowly see how it is after two weeks of rest. ok good luck ps just come back through this question through answer this above and it should get to me. ok
================================================================================
Question: does vitamin c help colds?
Baseline Response: The vitamin c is used to help prevent colds.
The reason why vitamin c helps colds is because it reduces the need for skin to be covered with a lot of water. The body absorbs the water from the skin and so the skin can feel cool. When it's cold, the skin actually absorbs more of the vitamin c, but that's not enough to help it.
When the sun is shining, the body absorbs vitamin c so it can see more of it. This helps the body to keep its temperature down.
What does it do to help cold?
The vitamin c prevents the skin from becoming too cold.
How does vitamin C work?
When you use the vitamin C, the vitamin is absorbed into the skin. When the skin is covered with the vitamin, it gives the vitamin a nice, refreshing feel.
This helps to make the skin more soft.
You can also use the Vitamin C

Expected Response: the jury is out on whether vitamin c can prevent a cold. and according to the latest research vitamin c doesn’t make a cold shorter or less severe. although experts do not recommend upping your dosage for that purpose some say it may help ward off germs if you’ve been exposed to physical or environmental stress -- for example with especially strenuous exercise or exposure to bitter cold weather. even so some people swear by it. “i have some vitamin c in my diet every day but i bump the dose up when i get sick ” says lauren richter do assistant professor of family and community medicine at the university of maryland center for integrative medicine. “generally it will reduce the length of the symptoms by at least a day or two and also will help with the severity ” she says. an extra 500 milligrams a day is about all you need.

Question: is my six month old spoiled already
Baseline Response: you don't have to be spoiled, but I'll try and show you how to make it.
How to Make It
The easiest thing for me to do is to make a recipe for a recipe. I'm a bit of a sucker for the classic recipes that I make myself, but this one really works. I like to add some spice to my spice mix. I also like to use a little bit of baking soda to make the mixture more silky. The spice mix is then made to look like this:
The next thing I need to do, is to add a little baking powder.
I'm not sure why you don. But I have a few tricks up my sleeve to help you.
First, I just make sure the ingredients are all blended together. If you don`t have any mix of ingredients in your recipe, you can just add the ingredients. Then just add a few drops of baking powder

Expected Response: good. a "spoiled child" if there is such a thing is a child that is taken care of very well. you don't need to worry about comments others may make about his/her behavior. allow the child to grow and mature. you will have plenty of time and opportunity to encourage self-reliance. right now at age six month they need the parent. a lot. this is not spoiling.

Expected Response: any generic or store-brand multivitamin tablet would be sufficient to ensure you are getting your recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. there are various brand names available but i usually recommend the generic versions to save money. there is no reason to spend a lot of money on a vitamin supplement.
================================================================================
Question: is bacteria vaginosis a std
Baseline Response: it is a common STD. It is not a disease that can be cured by surgery or surgery alone. It can be treated with antibiotics and medications.
There are many ways to treat the disease. The most common is to prevent the spread of the bacteria. It has been shown that this way is very effective.
How is vaginitis caused?
The symptoms of vaginismus are usually mild but sometimes severe. The symptoms include:
The body starts to feel like it is going through a painful process.
The chest pain begins to worsen and the pressure increases.
In some cases, the pain may go away.
Other times, it may be worse.
Some people are able to get rid of the infection.
What is the history of the disease?
There is no history of vagina faucet infection. The bacteria that cause vaginosarcoma are a combination of bacteria that are

Expected Response: not necessarily but the bacteria that causes it can be sexually-transmitted. it is not uncommon for women to get this bacterial infection without sexual contact.
================================================================================
Question: does a migraine always include pain or can you just have light sensitivity?
Baseline Response: the same question as above. The most common migraine is migraine headaches that are hard on the eyes. When you have migraine headaches, you have to have light-sensitive vision. If you have a migraine headache, you probably have light sensitive vision.
If you have migraines, you might have light sensitivities, like a migraine of the eye. It might also be a migraine that is not very good.
Do you have any other migraine headaches?
Do not try to get rid of them.

Expected Response: yes you can get just the sensitivity. i've had the all the symptoms to the extreme of being temporarily paralyzed. had all the tests done. started getting them when i was 15. that was 32 years ago and they have changed over the years. i do get many silent migraines.
================================================================================
Question: my doctor says i'm obese. are diet pills a good option?
Baseline Response: yes, as a weight loss tool, they are. I think they are not. They're not as effective as a diet pill, but they are effective. If you're looking to lose weight, you should be able to do the following: 1. Lose 30% to 50% of your body weight by the end of the day
2. Lose 1% or more of your weight by day 3
3. Lose 2% or less of your fat by day 4
4. Lose 3% or fewer fat by week 6
5. Lose 4% or greater fat by month 9
6. Lose 5% or even more fat by year 15
7. Lose 6% or any of the above by year 20
8. Lose any of those weight loss goals by year 25
9. Lose the goal weight for at least 3 weeks
10. Lose at least 1 weight loss goal

Expected Response: i have to talk to a lot of patients about weight loss. one of the things that i will ask them is did the doctor go over what their bmi or body mass index is. that gives us an idea of really how obese they might be and then incorporate lifestyle changes first. so many times we think of a pill as an instant quick fix. and that's really not the answer. i'll ask patients how active they are and are they incorporating some type of exercise into their daily routine. simple things like walking can really help reduce weight and make you feel better. you should be walking at least 10 000 steps a day and to help you track that you can actually buy a pedometer in almost any store today. they're pretty inexpensive they are under about $20 and you can actually track your progress through a diary and feel good. also making changes to your diet that can include decreasing the amount of fatty foods that you have making more healthier options. try these options first before you go down the path to medication. there is one over-the-counter medication approved by the fda to help people lose weight and it's called alli or orlistat. orlistat helps people lose weight by blocking some of the fat they eat from being absorbed. even though orlistat is available over-the-counter it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you take it.
================================================================================
Question: do you ever outgrow food allergies or can the severity of allergic reactions change as we age?
Baseline Response: we do not. We are just happy to help you if you have a food allergy.
Are you allergic to any food? Are you allergic if you can't find the right food for you? Are your allergies related to allergies to foods? Are there any other allergies you might have?
This is a great question. You will need to be able to explain what foods are and aren't allergies.
What are the ingredients that you need?
We will need the following:
1. The food itself

5. The name of the person who made the food and the name of their company
6. The date on which the food was made and when it was made
7. The

================================================================================
Question: is it wise to use a nebulizer for nasal congestion?
Baseline Response: I have used a nasal congestion nasal spray for over a decade and it has worked great. The problem I have with this nasal spray is that it causes nasal congestion. The only thing I have found that works is a nasal spray that I use on my tongue and mouth. The nasal spray can also be diluted with water. This is why it is important to keep a bottle of nasal spray on hand. It should not be used on your nose and mouth as it may cause an allergic reaction.
How do I get the nasal spray to work?
A: It is very simple. I will give you some information about how to use the nasal mask.
1. Wash your face with cold water and apply a hot washcloth. If you are wearing a mask that is not comfortable for you, you will need to wear a mask with a warm washcloth to prevent any discomfort.
2. Rinse

Expected Response: nebulizers are used to deliver vapors to the lungs. nebulizers are also used to help deliver asthmatic medications to the lungs for infants and other patients that have a difficult time using inhalers with spacers. the medications used are not for nasal congestion but for asthma. nasal congestion medications should not be poured into the nebulizers without supervision or recommendation form you health- care provider. check with your health-care providers prior to doing so.
================================================================================
Question: are my wife and i considered a family when buying health insurance or do we have to have kids for this category?

How do I get health insurance if I have a problem?
The benefits of insurance include coverage of certain medical conditions

================================================================================
Question: my 12 y/o daughter has pain in her left arm. what kind of a doctor should we see? orthopaedist or otherwise? !
Baseline Response: We do not know. The following doctors have recommended that patients who are suffering from pain should be placed on a ventilator and placed on an orthopedic device.
It is recommended that the patient should be monitored regularly.
I am a nurse and I am the only one with an orthopractor. I have been told that this is not a good idea.
There is no problem with my daughter's pain and it is not due to a ventilated arm.
The doctor has advised that if the patient is on a non ventilated device, they should be given a ventilation device. This will help to reduce the pain.
We have seen the results of the orthopractic device on my daughter.
When I see the results, I am relieved that she has pain. However, I

Expected Response: allow her to be examined by her primary care medical provider first. there may be a logical reason for her symptoms and hopefully and easy solution.
================================================================================
Question: safest carotid blockage removal procedure?
Baseline Response: The safest caroxidizer is the caroxide. The safest blockage is a mixture of caroxides and the fat. The fat is the product of the reaction of the carboxylation of carboxylic acid and the caroxide (a molecule that is also known as a carboxymethyl). The fat reacts with the caroxygen, which is the component that is responsible for the carotenoid, which in turn is responsible of the protein. The caroxylation also occurs in the liver, which, in turn, is responsible in the formation of proteins that are able to bind to fat.
Answer 1: What are the main differences between a caroxed carboxamide and a caroquinone blockage?
1. Caroxide is a caroxic compound that is toxic to the liver.
2. Carboxylate is a compound that inhibits the formation

Expected Response: the safest and preferred method is usually inserting a stint assuming this an option based on the severity and location of your stenosis. my best friend is getting this done soon as well. the procedure is minimally-invasive relative fast and the outcome tends to be excellent.

Question: is there a safe dosage of benadryl i can give my 5-month-old baby who is battling a very congested nose?
Baseline Response: yes, the dosage is around 2mg and it works great. My baby is getting a very bad rash every day. I will do a little more testing to see if it is right for her.
Source: http://www.nursinghealth.com/news/news-from-a-new-drug-in-my-baby-baby

Expected Response: this is a good question because benadryl is not a nasal decongestant and will do nothing for the stuffy nose (not to mention this medication should not be given to a child this young. ) you want to use saline drops to help thin out the mucus in the nose and then use a nasal aspirator to help clear the passageway. i also recommend running a vaporizer in the baby's bedroom -- that usually helps a lot as well for congestion. parents need to be very careful about cough and cold medications in infants and children so take the time to talk to your pharmacist.
================================================================================
Question: what is present in semen after a man has had a vasectomy? . if a man is taking medication how much if any of the medication would be present in his semen?
Baseline Response: The present evidence suggests that the present drug effect of vasectomy is not the only one. The effect of a vasectomies on the semen of a man was studied in a study of about 10,000 men who had been given a vasilostomator. The results showed that the men who were given vasectosilostomy had a significantly higher sperm count compared with those who were not given vasectomy. In contrast, the results of the study of 1,000 healthy men who received a vasefectomist did not show any significant difference in sperm count. The study of 5,000 young men who gave a vasilection did not give the same result as the study with the vasectomy drug. The findings of the present study suggest that the vasectotoxic effect

Expected Response: everything but the sperm (hopefully). semen is from the prostate gland; sperm is from testicles so you will still have a normal ejaculation but without any microscopic sperm.

Question: i have itching and discomfort around the anal opening. i don't have hemroids. i can't seem to rid of the problem?
Baseline Response: i'm not sure if this is a normal or a problem with my anus. it is definitely a problem. it has nothing to do with my skin, my body, my sexuality, or my anatomy. i am not going to give up on it. i'm sorry if you think I'm a dick, and i'm glad you don't think I am.
This is not a problem at all. it's just a soreness around the anus. i know it is a sore, and it's getting worse every day. but i'm fine. i want to go back to my normal routine. and i'll be back soon.
How can i get rid of this problem? you should see your doctor before taking any other medicines. i have never had any problems with my rectal or anal opening, and this is

Expected Response: there are many things that can cause an itchy anal area so your first step is to be properly examined and diagnosed. not wiping carefully after a bowel movement can result in irritation and this irritation can itch. soap residuals after bathing laundry detergents or perfumed dryer softener sheets can cause a chemical reaction around the anus. minor skin infections or anal fissures (tiny cracks in the skin) can itch. and finally if you have close association with children pinworms are notorious for causing an itchy bottom. pinworms typically come out at night. each of these would have an individual treatment so having a correct diagnosis first is essential even if you are not enthusiastic about having your medical provider examine this area.
================================================================================
Question: i am pregnant (in my first trimester) and i have some chest congestion. is there any safe medications i can use?

answer: I am currently pregnant and have had three miscarriages. am my pregnancy at risk?
You can view a list of all miscarriages that have been reported in the United States and Canada.
You may also want to check out our FAQs page to learn more about pregnancy testing and pregnancy tests.
Your pregnancy test results can be found at the CDC's pregnancy test site.

Expected Response: the only medications you can use are the one's your ob allows you to use. call their office and you can get the patient specific "okay". there are no universal lists of safe medications so each ob has their own preferences.
================================================================================
Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent?
Baseline Response: The most important test is the screening of a patient for colostrum cancer. This test is called an adenocarcinoma screening, and is administered to the patient when they are diagnosed with colorecarcinomas. This screening is done by a physician or medical examiner who has been trained to screen for colitis.
The screening is performed by a specialist who has experience with colitis and has been diagnosed with the disease.
How does the screening work?
A patient is given a blood sample to measure a sample of the colonic mucosa, which contains the colon and colonic fluid. The test results are sent to a doctor or medical examiners. The blood sample is then sent to the lab for analysis.
What is the test?
The blood sample contains the results of a cancer screening. The tests are administered by

Expected Response: tests to help your doctor see if colorectal cancer has metastasized or recurred include: an abdominal ultrasound to find the cause of pain or swelling in your abdomen. a colonoscopy to see if cancer has returned to your intestine. blood tests to find out if cancer has returned ( cea ) or to find the cause of symptoms such as weakness fatigue fever bruising or weight loss ( complete blood count and blood profile ). a chest x-ray to find the cause of symptoms such as persistent coughing coughing up blood chest pain or difficult breathing. a ct scan mri or pet scan to see if colorectal cancer has spread into the chest or organs in the abdomen or pelvis. a brain ct scan or mri to look into symptoms such as confusion paralysis numbness vision problems vertigo or headaches. a biopsy such as a liver biopsy or a lung biopsy to find out where the cancer cells have spread. a bone scan to find out whether cancer cells have spread to the bones. what to think about colorectal cancer often comes back even after successful treatment. if you had colorectal cancer in the past pay close attention to your body and see your doctor regularly. tell your doctor about any changes such as decreased appetite bloating or an increase in the size of your belly. your cancer may return even if you do everything you can to prevent it. if this happens focus on what you and your doctor can do to treat your symptoms to help you feel better and live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what is the difference between novolog 70/30 and novolin 70/30 insulins>
Baseline Response: Novologs 70/31 is the only type that doesn't have the same effect as insulin 70.
Novolin 80/30 is the type that has a negative effect on the body.
novolin 100/30 has a positive effect.
(The only type with a negative effects are insulinosolins, which are also the only insulino type that is not a type with no effect on either the body or the mind.
As for novolins, novolins and insulosols are the only types that have a negative impact on the brain.
The only insolins that have negative effects on the mind are insolinosolin, insulolinsin and insulinolins.
What is the Difference Between Insulosolins AND Insulinosols

Expected Response: this is a very important question so i'm glad you asked. before the new "insulin pens" came out there were four types of insulin : rapid-acting short-acting intermediate-acting and long-acting. when it comes to the pre-mixed insulins like novolog 70/30 there are fewer differences between the brands (for example novolog versus novolin). whether contained in a bottle or in a pen the premixed insulins all contain a combination of both an intermediate-acting insulin and a short-acting insulin. the numbers on the bottle or pen refer to the percentage of each type of insulin contained in the mixture. that means both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 contain a mixture that is 70% intermediate-acting insulin with 30% short-acting insulin. however novolin 70/30 takes slightly longer to begin working than novolog 70/30 which has a rapid onset. both novolin 70/30 and novolog 70/30 may last up to 24 hours in the system. no matter what kind of insulin you've been prescribed it's crucial you understand how to use it correctly. using any insulin incorrectly can cause serious side effects. if you don't understand how to use your insulin please consult a pharmacist as soon as possible. hope this helps!

Question: can anxiety a side affect to depression?
Baseline Response: yes, and no.
There is no difference between depression and anxiety. Depression is a condition that is not caused by a person's being anxious, and anxiety is a mental condition that occurs in the midst of an intense emotional state.
The difference between anxiety and depression is not what is measured by the amount of time you spend in a room with other people, but by the fact that you are not as anxious or depressed as you think.
For example, in the study, the researchers found that people who had been anxious for a long time were more likely to be depressed than those who had not been anxious, but the fact is that people in the anxious state had an even higher rate of depression than those in the depressed state. In other words, they had a higher rate than those with normal mood.
These results suggest that anxiety and anxiety are both different symptoms of a disorder, and the differences in their symptoms may be

Expected Response: not a side effect per se but a person can have both anxiety and depression. hi if you google depression it come up as depression and anxiety they do go hand in hand. but if your having problems with it and your male it will affect your sex life depression and anxiety are known sex killers also the drugs for it are also sex killers. google natural ways out of depression and anxiety your find lots of drug free help for being drug free its well worth doing if you do choose to go drug free please do this through your doctor. and your doctor wont like you doing it there's no drug kick back money in it for him/her you being drug free. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: i stopped taking my bipolar medications a week and a half ago. can i just restart where i left off?
Baseline Response: no.
Answer to Question 2: I am currently on a medication for bipolar disorder. Can i just try a different medication and see if my bipolar disorder resolves?
Solution: i have a medication that is working, and i have been prescribed it for over a year. i know that if i don't take it, my bipolar symptoms will continue to worsen.
Solution to Question 3: I have a medical condition that requires me to stop taking any medications. Is it a good idea to take a break from taking medications for a while to rest and recharge?

Expected Response: i would like to know why you decided to stop taking your medications and does your doctor or health care provider know? this is very risky and it is important that you understand that with some medications you should not just stop them abruptly because you felt like it. nor is it wise to just "start them up" again when you feel like it. i would strongly recommend that you call your doctor and let them know what you did. they may want to see you for further evaluation and gradually ease you back onto your medications.

Question: what is bph?
Baseline Response: bph is a statistical method for predicting the number of births in a population based on the percentage of births that are expected to be a single birth. In the case of the US, the percentage that is expected to happen to be one birth is about 0.7%.
A good example of this is the birth rate at the end of World War II, in which the US had a population of about 9 million. The birth rate of the United States was about 2.5 births per 1,000 people. In that case, the US would have had a birth rate that was only 1.3 births per 1000 people. This is very similar to the rate of growth of the Soviet Union, which was 2.6 births per 10,000 population.
The US has a higher birth rate than the Soviet bloc, which had a higher rate of births.
What is bb?
Bb is a probability distribution, which measures the

Expected Response: bph (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is an enlargement of the prostate gland. this gland surrounds the tube that drains the urine from the bladder. the symptoms of bph can be caused by a tensing of the enlarged muscle in the prostate gland which blocks the passage of urine. this can lead to such symptoms as: a weak or start-and-stop stream when urinating a feeling that the bladder is not completely emptied after urination a delay or difficulty in the beginning of urination a need to urinate often during the day and especially at night a feeling that you must urinate immediately.

Question: how can i be sure my cosmetic surgery will be safe?
Baseline Response: my doctor said that if I do not have a history of cancer before my surgery, then my surgeon may be able to provide you with a referral to a specialist.
My doctor said I will have to wait until my surgery is over before I can go on to have my surgery.
I had surgery on my right leg and the surgeon said I need to be sure that I will not have to have surgery on that leg.
How can I tell if my surgery will not cause my leg pain?
My leg is not going to be pain free, but I will need to wait for a referral.
If my leg is going to pain free for some time, I will be asked to wait a few days to see my doctor.
The doctor said, that if my leg goes numb and I have to go on with my surgery (which will take a few weeks), then my surgery should be done

Expected Response: i think the two most important safety questions that a patient can ask the doctor is one will there be a fully accredited anesthesia specialist in attendance anesthesia specialist being either a certified registered nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist. that’s number one. second is the facility accredited? now accreditation is kind of a broad term. for instance the facility could be licensed by the state. states do that. hospitals are licensed. the state will license a facility. the federal government does the same. in other words you cannot operate on a medicare patient and expect medicare to pay for it unless they’ve given it the stamp of approval. by the way the standards are almost identical. and some facilities for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in do their evaluation and asked to be approved. but there are also private credentialing companies that do this and by the way most hospitals in the united states are accredited by essentially what is called the joint commission. it’s called the joint commission on accreditation of health facilities. this licenses hospitals outpatient surgery centers radiology x-ray clinics. so again very high standards so that there is no a or b it’s all a. if you get the right answers to those questions you’ll feel comfortable. and i would tell you also parenthetically most of the doctor anesthesiologists that i know will not work in an unaccredited unlicensed facility because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. for example if the facility didn’t have all the appropriate life support systems why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong he doesn’t have the technical backup. he doesn’t want to be in that position. he wants to deliver to the patient when needed if needed as remote as that possibility is he wants to deliver the best he has.

Question: what is vocal cord dysfunction?
Baseline Response: vocal cord dysplasia is a condition in which the vocal cords are not properly formed. This condition causes the vocal cord to fail to grow properly and can lead to a short-lived, chronic condition.
A vocal cord is a small, flexible, or flexible cord that is connected to the central nervous system. It is often attached to the front of the neck and is attached to an external muscle.
In many cases, vocal cords can become un-formed or damaged.
If you have a vocal cord problem, it is important that you receive the correct care. The best treatment is to use a special kind of cord to help you get the proper help.
What is the cause of vocal cord Dysplasia?
The cause of voice dysplasias is a combination of a lack of vocal cords, a lack or difficulty with the vocal chords, and other factors.
The most common cause of dysplaspia is

Expected Response: vocal cord dysfunction is a condition that causes abnormal movement of the vocal cords. this causes episodes of shortness of breath that come on quickly can be triggered by activities such as singing and often do not respond to asthma medications. vocal cord dysfunction can mimic asthma.

Question: i am 67 years old and on medicare. i also have supplemental health insurance. i assume the aca will not give me any plans that are more affordable but what benefits do i have as a senior under the aca (besides the reductions in my medication bill)?
Baseline Response: i have no insurance or plans, i just get my medicare for free and have no need for medicare at all.
Answer 2: you have no idea what is going on with your insurance or your health plan.

Expected Response: that's right. you are not eligible for plans sold through the new health insurance marketplaces. the gap in prescription drug costs closing is one of the biggest benefits of the law for seniors covered by medicare. other benefits such as no cost preventive screenings and wellness visits.

Question: what kind of painkiller can i take that wont thin my blood. i have fibromyalgia and in a lot of pain. i'm on cumadin due to blood clot's after a surgery i'm currently taking a muscle relaxer called skelaxin for the pain but it doesn't help the pain if taken alone. when i take it with ibuprofen or naproxin it seems to help a lot. can i take either of these pills given the fact that i'm on blood thinner medication? if not what can i take to help pain?
Baseline Response: i'm still on blood thin medication but i'm not taking it for any other reason. i've been taking them for over a year and it has been really good. i am still having a lot and i'm in pain. it is hard to take ibupropion at the moment but i've tried many different meds and am still using them.
Answer 1: it is not the same

Expected Response: the best answer to your question is this: consult your physician. you're smart to think about the "blood thinning" properties of over-the-counter pain relievers given you're on coumadin (warfarin). generally speaking it's not wise to take any nsaid -- such as aspirin naproxyn or ibuprofen -- when you're taking warfarin or another anti-clotting drug. in this case acetaminophen (tylenol) is your only over-the-counter option. however you should ask your health care provider what to do in your specific case. everyone is different and your provider may be able to give you a prescription pain reliever that will not interact with the warfarin. wishing you well! soma or carisoprodol is a generic drug and is used for the treatment of muscle pain and muscle injury. it is used by the person who is suffering from muscle sprain and pain. you can from chemist shop or online at topdrugmart dot com
================================================================================
Question: do you find patients are embarrassed to ask a doctor about sexual concerns?
Baseline Response: I would say they are. And the doctors are embarrassed.
And that's what I've seen in patients. And that's a problem.
I think that's one of the things I'm concerned about is that patients are not being asked about their sexual issues.
One of the reasons that I'm trying to get more information is because I've been in the community a long time, and there's been a lot of discussion about sexual issues, but one of my clients that I've talked to, he's a physician and he's an openly gay man. And I don't know if he's ever asked about his sexual issues or not, but it's a very interesting topic. And he's been very supportive of me. And so I think that the physicians should be very sensitive about that.
The other thing I want to say about the issue is that it's not only a problem

Expected Response: yes and i think doctors are too. but sexual issues are important to discuss. doctors have to read their patients well. you have to get a sense of their comfort level with you and how willing they are to talk about personal issues. i think when the doctor does bring it up it shows it's ok to talk about sex. sometimes the patient is surprised -- or even relieved -- that the doctor raises the subject because it means they don't have to.

Question: what is this itch/rash that appears on the head of my penis after oral sex? . i have seen a dr. regarding the rash and itching and was prescribed cream to treat yeast infections. this does solve the problem however this happens every single time i receive oral sex. i am trying to figure out what the root cause of this would/could be as i suffer great discomfort for the several days that follow.
Baseline Response: - no, i have to use a spray bottle. water can be used on the penis, it is

Expected Response: hi ok you know how your getting then you know how to stop it the reaction your getting could be that your penis head does not like saliva so its either do it with a condom on not a very nice taste for your partner or just give wanting oral sex. something to think on. good luck

Question: everytime i make out with this guy i get a sore throat the next day. this guy smokes and doesn't eat healthy. he is sort of a fling and so occasionally we'll get together. we make out a lot so could there be something tranferred when we kiss that makes me have a sore throat the next day?
Baseline Response: NO. I'm not sure.
This is a story about what happened in the parking lot of a local bar and how it made me feel. I was sitting there and was sitting on a bench. I didn't really have a chance to do much, so I said "hey, I've got to do something." The guy just started talking about a friend of mine who was drinking with a guy who was in the bar and I said, "oh, man, I'm gonna make a deal with you and you're gonna take me to the club." He said, 'no, I want to go to the bar.'"

Expected Response: i can't imagine a non-smoker enjoying kissing a smoker. might as well kiss a filthy ash tray.
================================================================================
Question: what is uric acid?
Baseline Response: it is an acid compound that is formed in the intestines by the digestion of small amounts of fat and protein. In general, uric acids are found in the body's blood. The body absorbs uric Acid from the blood through the kidneys, and the body also converts the acid into acetyl CoA and other substances. The liver is responsible for converting these substances into acetone. The human body also absorbs the uric Acetate from the liver, which is the major enzyme involved in the process of converting uric to acetylcoA.
This is the acid that is used in the most common forms of diabetes, heart disease, and many other diseases.
What is urics acid? urics is a type of dietary acid, which has been used for centuries to treat many ailments.
The acid is produced by the bacteria that produce uricic acid. It is a natural product of the stomach, which produces

Expected Response: uric acid is a chemical breakdown product of metabolism. the liver produces uric acid by breaking down other chemicals called purines. uric acid is normally found in the blood in low concentrations. some people are prone to high uric acid levels which can sometimes lead to gout kidney stones or kidney damage. people with gout nearly always have high blood levels of uric acid although their levels may sometimes drop down to the normal range. due to the high uric acid concentration and other factors experts don’t understand uric acid crystals can form inside joints. during gout attacks uric acid crystal deposits cause joints to become inflamed swollen red and painful. exercise reduced red meat and alcohol intake and medications can help keep uric acid levels in the normal range.

Question: i'm having terrible ear and neck pain chest pains and i have a lump in my left breast. what could this mean? . i have a mammogram appointment in a few days. i have also been having pain in my groin area. i have a huge family history of cancer and i'm scared to death.
Baseline Response: my doctor told me that there are two different types of cancer that affect both my ear and my neck. The first type is benign and causes a small, but noticeable, lump in the middle of the ear. The second type is very rare and is caused by a tumor that is found in the ear canal. The lump in your ear and the tumor is a small tumor with no visible symptoms. If you have the cancer, it will not be as severe as you think.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. the fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with. i'm glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled. that is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation. while you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system. look for support from family and friends. try to distract yourself. focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem. if you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress. even though you have a family history of cancer it's not a sure bet you have cancer too. it's entirely possible your breast lump is benign (non-cancerous) and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress. i know it's hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis. take care of yourself!
================================================================================
Question: can i self-administer systematic desensitization to treat a phobia or does it have to be under the care of a therapist?
Baseline Response: Yes, you can self-administrate systematic desenitization, and if you feel that you are being treated for a phobic or a phobias, you may want to do so.
What can I do to self-initiate self-management?
What you can do to help your therapist can be:
1. Contact your therapist. You can talk to them directly, or ask them to talk to you through a therapist.
2. Tell your therapist about your concerns.
3. Ask your therapist if you want to talk about your fears or concerns. Ask them if they feel you are feeling any of these things.
4. Use the online tool to share your concerns or concerns with your therapist (e.g. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter).
5. Ask for help with

Expected Response: hmmm. well the concept is to gradually expose oneself to the stimulus that provokes anxiety and exinguish the fear response by graded exposure. i suppose if someone knows what they are doing then there's no reason they couldn't apply the principle on their own as they saw fit. depending on what the fear was one would want some grasp of knowing how much exposure is too much and what to do if the technique didn't work.

Question: i left an off clip on repellent on overnight with the windows open woke up with a right side headache & bloody nose. that was two days ago and the only thing still happening is the headache. i was feeling that i was getting sick before that because of right ear pain. poison control said it should not be a big problem because off has a low concentration of deet but my headache wont go away. should i wait or go to a doc asap feels like a muscular pain because it is tender to pressure and hurts more when i turn my head the pain travels down to my posterior neck muscles (right side).
Baseline Response: i just went to the doc to see if they could help me. they said it's ok, i have the headache but it doesn't get better until i can sit and relax.
Answer.

Expected Response: i agree with poison control. i can't imagine that your headache or bloody nose has anything to do with the fact that you had a clip-on mosquito repellent. the most common cause of headache is the a muscle-tension type but you would need to see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. oh that is a relief! thank you! but it's strange because no pain meds are helping at all with the pain. it is very possible it was caused by over exposure to this product. the off clip on does not use deet but a different kind of repellent called metofluthrin so the symptoms will not be the same as over exposure to deet. the first day i used one for a 3 hour hunt i got a pretty severe headache that started about 30 minutes after the hunt and lasted about 4 hours. i was just recovering from a virus to i initially thought nothing of it. later the same day i found one of the top customer reviews for this product on amazon. com mentions it caused severe headaches almost everytime he used it. the warning labels seem to go overboard in cautioning you to wash your hands and clothes after handling to the point it made me a bit nervous about using the product. i would venture to say from my own experience and the amazon reviewers experiences using the product as directed and still getting headaches if you fell asleep in an enclosed space with this thing blowing that its almost certain that most of your symptoms can be attributed to it. this is apparently some extremely potent poison.

Question: how do you get pregnant? . especially when it's difficult to ovulate
Baseline Response: if you are expecting an infant, you need to know how to get pregnant.
Here are some tips and tricks for getting pregnant.

Expected Response: if you are having unprotected sex and have not conceived it may be time for you to see a gynecologist or fertility specialist to see if there is an underlying medical reason in you or your partner. the female body is designed to get pregnant; not to prevent it. many times there are discoverable reasons so you first step is to be properly examined and evaluated.

Question: what causes rumbling noise in both ears? . what causes rumbling like a motor running in both ears? i can't hear bass tones. my blood pressure is good. . i have no other symptoms.
Baseline Response: when you are doing anything, you have to try. When you are trying, you will always try.
This answer is not an exact science. It is a subjective observation.
If you do not know what is going on in your head, you cannot know what you are experiencing.
When you are feeling a pain, you can not know whether it is a pain or not.
You can not feel the sensation of pain.
In the mind, there is no sensation of a pain. The sensation is not a feeling.
It is the feeling of a sensation.
The feeling of an object is not the feeling. You cannot feel a feeling of the object.
There is no feeling of pain or a feeling that is not in the mind

Expected Response: it may be pressure buildup in your ears which can happen from allergies. you could try an over-the-counter allergy treatment -- something with a decongestant if you have no heart problems and your blood pressure is fine (make sure to read the label to make sure the medication is ok for you) -- for a few days and see if that helps. if not you should check with your doctor as you don't want to ignore hearing loss.
================================================================================
Question: took diazepam 25 years ago for 15 years -- how can i counter any brain damage
Baseline Response: it's hard to find any scientific research on this, but some things are known about the effects of diazepams and some things do not.
The first thing you need to know about the Diazepam is that it is a very strong hypnotic drug. The second thing you must know is that Diazepams are very effective at inducing a trance state.
You are going to need to be able to see your body for 2 minutes to get your mind off of this drug and you will need to put it down and get some sleep.
It is a good idea to have a couple of sleep aids. The first is a sleeping pill that is very effective in inducing a dream state. The pill is called a lucid dream pill. It is a pill that allows you to take it from your mouth, into your eyes, and into your mouth.
There is also a

Expected Response: you would have to see a neurologist just to know if you had any diazepam-related brain damage. i do not know the details of your medication use. if you are having any neurological issues that you attribute to brain damage it may not be related at all to your past use of this medication. some parts of the brain recover nicely; other parts do not so it would be impossible for any medical provider to blindly delve into your case to such details over the internet.

Question: any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i'm too tired to cook after work?
Baseline Response: I have a suggestion for a healthy eating night.
I was looking for a recipe for a spicy meal. The recipe is very simple and I had the idea to make a spicy version of a dish that would be made with just a few ingredients. It is super easy to make and easy to prep. The meat and vegetables are the main ingredients, I used a whole bunch of spices, herbs and garlic. I like to add a little bit of salt and pepper to the spices to keep things spicy. The spices were really strong and good for me, I added a bit of garlic powder and a bit more salt and salt to the garlic powder. I think that this is a great way to add salt and a little pepper to your spicy dish. I have tried this recipe a couple of times and I have always liked it. I would love to hear your thoughts on it.

Expected Response: you are definitely not alone. however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day. for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite. if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to (and not calories) like rotisserie chicken. just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro. pick out veggies at the salad bar — they are already washed chopped and prepped for you. you can take them home and roast them in a 450 degree f oven for 5-7 minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. this is a great and easy veggie side dish that wouldn’t take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils. sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating. for instance tonight i got home after 12 hours of traveling and i’m battling over what i could make for dinner — or — to pick up thai food. i think that thai is going to win tonight. but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order. i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk. while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra 1000 calories that can come from some of the richer choices won’t be worth it. what will be a much better choice will still be delicious. spring rolls that are fresh — not fried — and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice. another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil (ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants). also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice. i’m reminding myself of this as i am you. when i’m tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice. another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out. many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices.

Question: how successful are today’s vasectomy reversals?
Baseline Response: Well, I think it's pretty amazing that it's not just about the vasectomy, but about how successful vasectomy reversal is. And the last thing we want is a patient who's going to be having an abnormal heartbeat, who's having a heart attack, who is going to have a vasectomy. So we want to be able to get a vasopressor to be there for them. And there are a number of things that we do that we think will help.
There are a lot of things we can do to reduce the risk of heart attacks and other things that might cause a heart event. And that's what we're going to do. We're going back to work on things that are actually more important to the patient, such as having a vasorectomies that are done, or that are in the right place at the right time. And we're doing things that will

Expected Response: with advances in technique the microsutures the instruments that we use the magnification and scopes pre and post-operative care we can achieve fertility in 90 to 95 percent of the men after they’ve had a vasectomy and as far out as 42 years after they’ve had a vasectomy. does it matter how old or archaic your vasectomy was? not at all. it’s not the technique of the vasectomy that’s important. it’s not even the number of years since your vasectomy. it really is dependent on two factors. one is the skill and expertise of the microsurgeon does he or she know what they are doing and can do it well as well as female factors. if you fall in love with a 25-year-old who’s demonstrated prior fertility things are probably going to be great. you don’t need that much. on the other hand if you fall in love with a 54-year-old woman who is going through menopause then you’re going to have a real hard time with conception no matter how good the surgeon is. so it’s female factor and skill and expertise of the microsurgeon are the major factors in determining the success of the reversal.

Question: 3 year olds nose has a bad smell coming fron it
Baseline Response: 3 year olds eyes have bad smell
Answer to: 3 years old nose has bad smell


I have a 3 year old daughter with a nose that has bad smells coming from the mouth. I don't know how it has started, or if it is just a matter of time.


There is a little bit of a smell from the nose in her mouth. The nose is not going to be as bad as she might think.

 "I just don't like the smell of her mouth"


My daughter has bad odor coming from her nose and the smell is coming from my nose. I think she is getting sick of this smell. I would like to have a doctor to check on her.

My sister has bad nose odor coming out of her nose. She has been trying to get some help with her nose, but has gotten it worse.




It's been

Expected Response: the most common reason for this is a foreign body usually food. your three-year old for some reason decided it was a good idea to put a green bean pea or? in the nose. if there is a bad smell and a nasty drainage from just one-side this is the most likely reason. nasal foreign bodies can be challenging to remove so it may be a good idea to allow the medical provider to do it for you.

Expected Response: for people with very low incomes the law provides a fair amount of financial assistance to make insurance affordable. depending on how much you earn in a year you may qualify for medicaid coverage which would be virtually no-cost coverage. if you make too much to qualify or you live in a state not expanding its medicaid program you'll likely qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of your insurance. to give you an early idea of your likely costs check out webmd's cost calculator. starting october 1st you can log on to your state's marketplace and start shopping for a health plan to learn your options.

Expected Response: most helpful answer based on your story you are highly highly unlikely to get pregnant in this way. sperm may look like tadpoles but they do not remain viable for very long in the mouth/throat and any expectorate that flowed past your genital area in the shower an hour later would not have the potential of cause you to become pregnant. swallowed semen cannot result in a pregnancy and even if there was a stray super-sperm that flowed past your vaginal area it would be a one in a zillion chance that it would squiggle up your vagina through your uterus and make it to a viable egg (assuming your were ovulating at the time. you are engaging in sexual activity which tends to escalate to more risky behavior in the future so you would be wise to use effective contraception from now on.

I know it is a bad idea but there are plenty of women who are using this pill to relieve their pain. They are not using it for the same reason as men, they are

Expected Response: it might be that you are ovulating? that usually happens 10-13 days after the first day of your last period. if you think that might be it on webmd there is an ovulation calendar that might help. here's a link - it says it's used to get pregnant but really you can use it for tracking your cycle: <link>

Question: gritty uncomfortable sensation under the eyelid in the right eye. it's also really red. the left one is ok. what is it?
Baseline Response: a black dot on the left eye.
Answer 2: A black dot in the middle of the nose.
1. The first thing you notice is that the middle nose has a white dot. it doesn't really have a white color.
2. The second thing you see is that it has a blue dot on it's bottom lip. it does have a blue color. the first thing that comes to mind is that this is the first time I've ever seen that. I've seen it before and it's a black eye. I'm guessing it's because of a mutation.
3. The third thing you look at is that there is a white light in the center of the middle face.
4. The fourth thing you know is that a black light is in the front of the right eyelid. it

Expected Response: there can be many causes for discomfort and redness in the eye. the only way to tell what is going on is to have your eye checked by your doctor or eye doctor right away. some possibilities include: a foreign body in the eye a stye an infection (viral bacterial or fungal) a chalazion (an inflammatory growth under the eyelid) or some other lesion. eye allergies and dry eyes are also possibilities. if you are a contact lens wearer do not put in your contacts until cleared by your doctor.

Question: what are the symptoms of prostatitis?
Baseline Response: It is a common and common condition in patients with prostatitus, which is the condition in which the prostatic muscles do not fully contract. These muscles may be painful, painful, and painful to touch.
What is prostatosis?
A prostatoid is a small, soft, painful tissue that is caused by a process called collagen synthesis. It is an abnormal form of the collagen that forms the skin around the prostatid. When a person experiences a prostatine deficiency, they will not feel much pain and have no sensation of pain. However, if they experience a prostatic deficiency, there will be a noticeable pain on the skin and in the joints.
The reason for this is that the prostacyte protein that makes up the skin of the prostaceus is not able to repair itself. The collagen that is involved in repairing this protein is unable to produce the necessary amount of collagen to repair

Expected Response: the symptoms are similar for all forms of prostatitis with the exception of acute prostatitis and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. symptoms of the chronic forms of prostatitis including chronic prostatitis/ pelvic pain syndrome inflammatory and noninflammatory may include: a frequent urge to urinate although you may pass only small amounts of urine. a burning sensation when urinating (dysuria). difficulty starting urination interrupted flow (urinating in waves rather than a steady stream) weaker-than-normal urine flow and dribbling after urinating. excessive urinating at night (nocturia). a sensation of not completely emptying the bladder. pain or discomfort in the lower back in the area between the testicles and anus in the lower abdomen or upper thighs or above the pubic area. pain may become worse during a bowel movement. pain or vague discomfort during or after ejaculation. pain in the tip of the penis. with acute prostatitis symptoms are severe come on suddenly and include fever and chills. signs of chronic bacterial prostatitis may be milder and come on suddenly or gradually over weeks or months and the symptoms may come and go. symptoms alone cannot be used to determine the type of prostatitis you have. numerous other conditions such as a bladder infection or benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) can cause symptoms similar to those of prostatitis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what is the best application for persons with ichthyosis?
Baseline Response: it is a question that needs to be answered in the most detailed way.
1. It is the reason why people with ichiitis do not have any sense of smell. In fact, if you had an ichthonic nose, you would not know what to do with the smell.
2. The ichthalonic nose has a sense of taste. If you had a taste for a piece of meat, you might not know how to taste it.
3. If someone had an unaltered ichthanasian nose, they would not have the sense of odor.
4. People with ikalophilia have a sense that they smell. If they have a taste that is not good, they are not able to smell it. This is called the ikathonic sense.

Baseline Response: " Yes, it is possible to use a zaltec after a zultec.
Q. What is a zalec ?
A. a zapec is a type of a zanec that is used for making puffs.
The zalic and zapic are the same thing, but you need to know the differences.
To take a puffed puff, you can use the zalich, which is a bit different from the zaltic.
You can use either a zac or a zaic. You can also use either of these.
Zapic: A puffed puff with a zapec, or a puff

Expected Response: i would like to know why you want to take otc zantac. both of these medications are used to treat heartburn but they are usually not taken together. it should be one or the other. zantac works by trying to decrease the amount of acid in the stomach where prilosec turns off the pump that makes stomach acid. typically you should take prilosec for 14 days in the treatment of heartburn. i would also like to ask if you are taking any other medications since zantac can interact with many of them.

Answer (in order of importance): eczemosis can be caused by: a) any bacteria in your body that cause you to have eczebelitis (a bacterial infection that can cause eczecrosis) b) some skin that has been exposed to a high temperature (usually in the summer or during the winter) c) an allergic reaction to a product (e.g. eczephenics

Question: i had a large injection of penicillin for strep. 2 days later my lymph nodes have swollen substantially. is this normal? . tuesday afternoon i started feeling sick sore throat cough body aches fatigue headache. thursday it felt so bad i went to the er. they glanced at my throat declared it to be strep shot me full of steroids painkillers and penicillin then sent me on my way. i began to feel better that day and yesterday felt mostly normal except for a persistent productive cough and weak voice. but as of this morning my lymph nodes are absurdly swollen and very tender. possible explanations?
Baseline Response: i was sick for 2 days and have been for over a year. i am currently taking a blood transfusion. i have started a blood donation to a family member and will be receiving it for the rest of my life. i feel like i am getting better and better but this is just a result of my infection and i am sick. i

Expected Response: those "glances" that pronounce a strep diagnosis really bug me. i hate those "treat 'em and street 'em" medical encounters. a strep test is so easy. so fast. so why not get an accurate definitive diagnosis before treating anyone with antibiotics and steroids? most sore throats are viral. not strep. and one of those viruses (ebv) causes mononucleosis (mono). giving antibiotics to someone with undiagnosed mono is worthless and can actually make things worse. a mono test is easy to do as well but apparently the er medical provider didn't want to take those extra steps. lymph nodes normally enlarge in response to infection or inflammation in their neighborhood so strep (if you really had it) respiratory viruses and mono can all cause lymph node enlargements. viruses (even mono) self-resolve over time and do not respond to antibiotics. if you did have strep the penicillin injection (painful! ) would have taken care of it. if you don't get better see your regular medical provider. and insist on a careful thorough examination for mono and a few diagnostic lab tests.

Question: is tinnitus and shingles related? . hello i have both tinnitus and shingles for several years and it seems to be getting worst. for the last few months i have been very sick with tinnitus. this week shingles broke out on both sides of my butt (left side lower and right side higher). do you know if tinnitus and shingles are related? thank you. .
Baseline Response: - yes, i do have both, but

Expected Response: only if the shingles is in the ears. called ramsay-hunt syndrome. if you had this herpes infection in your ear area it can also cause tinnitus in some people. if you have herpes on your butt. tinnitus would not be related. shingles does not break out on both sides of your buttocks (it follows a nerve pathway and nerves do not cross over the midline of the spine) so i am guessing you have an incorrect diagnosis. you likely have something other than shingles causing your skin eruption.

Question: i stepped on a rusty nail 6/16/2013. i had a tetanus booster in 2008 after an injury. do i need to get another one now? . yesterday i stepped on a rusty nail while i was out by the horses. it went through my shoe and into my foot about 1/4" deep. it only bled about a drop so i soaked it last night in warm salt water for about an hour to help clean it out. i know i had a tetanus booster in 2008 after an injury. i do not remember if i have had one since then. i have been told that tetanus boosters are good for 5-10 years. do i need to get another booster now or is the one i know i got in 2008 sufficient?
Baseline Response: i can not remember. i did not have a tetraplegic booster until my mom bought it. i think it is not necessary to get a booster now. i am a 5 year old and

Expected Response: tetanus shots are statistically good for ten years although many clinicians will suggest a booster after five years. tetanus shots only prevent tetanus (lockjaw). it does not prevent a wound infection so watch for any signs of infection. it is really up to you to get a tetanus booster or not but theoreticallyl your vaccine is 2008 is still effective.

Question: will i get a false passitive if i take a pregnacy test while on birth control.
Baseline Response: i would not, but i think that if i had to choose between a false or an accurate passive passive, i would pick an accurate one.

Expected Response: what kind of birth control? if you are talking about the birth control pill then the answer is no. the birth control pill will not cause a false pregnancy test. a person can have a false pregnancy test anyway but not because of the pill. pregnancy tests check for the presence of a hormone called hcg. the pill does not have hcg.

Question: i have pustular psoriasis. i have small blisters on my hands and feet that bleed. what can i do? . i have been told that it is not curable. people seem to see it and think they can get it. help!
Baseline Response: no, but it is curable and it is a normal condition.
Answer to question: no.

Expected Response: pustular psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that most commonly occurs on the hands and feet. it is not infectious and not contagious. one of the best treatments is topical puva where a topical solution is applied to the areas and then exposed to ultraviolet light for specific amounts of time. there are dermatologists and university dermatology programs that have hand/foot light boxes and would be able to offer this treatment. we also use prescription-strength topical steroids and topical vitamin d to help control the condition. it is a chronic autoimmune condition with a genetic predisposition so it is not curable but it can be well-controlled.

Question: is there any truth to the eggplant dinner before labor? is there a pharmaceutical equivalent?
Baseline Response: there is, but it is not available in the United States. There is no information available about any of the drugs and treatments for eggplant deficiency.
Answer 2: Is there any medical information about the treatment of eggplant deficiencies?
A: There is, and it is available on the National Institutes of Health website.
If you are concerned about eggplant problems, you can visit the National Institute on Aging website. The information is available at http://www.nip.nih.gov/eggplant.htm.
The information on the eggplants website is also available at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine website. If you would like to read about the medical information on eggplant, you may also contact the National Research Council of the National Cancer Institute (NCRI), the National Association of Medical Examiners, the National Health and Nutrition Examination

Expected Response: there are a number of old wives tales regarding foods to eat to induce labor. unfortunately there are no studies in this area to prove the truth to these ideas. a prescription medication called pitocin (oxytocin) is used in the hospital to start or improve contractions.

Question: i had infection in left upper leg if antibiotics were needed. no idea where in fection came from. i have hardware in leg from surgery seven years ago could this cause it? have difficult being on it for long time and trouble walking.
Baseline Response: no i have been on it a lot in my life and i am still in pain and need to be more careful.

Question: is steph infacon contages
Baseline Response: I think that is the problem. The point is that steph is not contageable. There is no contage in the whole project. The problem is that some of the steps in the project are not contages, and the project itself does not have any contages. The project is not a contage.
The problem is the same as with the original design:
1. The original design is not the one that you want to use.
2. The idea of the project is that you need to build a project. You can build a big project, but you can't build a small project.
3. The one that is built is the one you want the most.
4. The goal of the entire project is to get the project to be a nice project. To build the project, you need some sort of goal.
5. You need to be able to build the whole system.

Expected Response: yes staphylococcal (staph) infections are contagious.

Question: does a vasectomy protect against hiv/aids and other sexually transmitted diseases?
Baseline Response: yes. A vasectomy protects against HIV and other infections that are not transmitted through the blood.
In fact, it is a safer option to have a vasectomized abortion. This is because vasectomy is a procedure that involves removing the vas deferens and removing the uterus. The procedure is done without any risk to the fetus.
How do you know if a vasection is safe for you?
When you have a baby, the doctor will usually check your blood and urine for HIV or other infections. This test is called a Hiv test and it will tell you if you are at risk for HIV. If you are not, the test can be used to help determine whether you are sexually active.
What are the advantages of having a vasected baby?
Vasectomization is safe because the procedure is safe to have and it is safe during

Expected Response: although it is extremely effective for preventing pregnancy vasectomy does not offer protection against hiv/aids or other sexually transmitted diseases. consequently it is important that vasectomized men continue to use condoms preferably latex which offer considerable protection against the spread of disease in any sexual encounter that carries the risk of contracting or transmitting infection.

I am on my second try and she told me she has had no symptoms. I was not sure if it was due to the stinging or the rash but I was able to get it on without it spreading.

Question: how do i become a better runner as someone with moderate experience running?
Baseline Response: I am a beginner runner. I run a lot of different things.
I have run a few different types of races, but I'm not a huge fan of "I want to run for three days and do all the rest". That's a whole other post.
In any case, you can probably run a 4-6 mile mile (or less) on any given day, but if you want to be a better "runner", you'll have to work a lot harder and work harder to get there.
How can I improve my overall running form?
It's pretty simple:
Run a mile or more.
Start with a running bar, like you would for a marathon.
Set a timer to run each mile.
Run 5-10 times in the first 10 seconds.
Repeat each 10 times.
At the end of each 10-second interval, you should

Expected Response: don’t get stuck constantly doing the same thing. challenge your current routine by experimenting with different types of runs. for example incorporate long runs to build endurance intervals to increase speed or hills to increase strength. you might find that experimenting with these different types of runs can add to the enjoyment you experience while running and can help to promote better running performance. next consider occasionally doing cross-training which in this case means doing exercise other than running. for example try adding swimming biking or strength training to your current exercise routine. cross-training helps to prevent burnout whether physical or mental and can help prevent overuse injuries. sometimes repeatedly doing the same exercise can be monotonous and redundant and you might get bored and want to discontinue with your exercise. adding variety to your routine can help keep exercise enjoyable for you. finally allow yourself time to rest and recover. over-training can hurt your progress and lead to injury such as stress fractures. resting is as important as the time you dedicate towards running.

Question: is it safe to have cosmetic surgery while breastfeeding?
Baseline Response: yes. It is safe to breastfeed while breastfeeding and is recommended to have a plastic breast pad on the breast. If you are breastfeeding, you should be able to use a breast pump or breast milk pump without surgery, and it is recommended that you breastfeed with the same precautions and procedures as your doctor prescribes. Breastfeeding is a safe, healthy and safe way to breast-feed and is not a disease.
In the past, there have been a number of cases of breast cancer in the U.S., which can lead to breast cancer. The following is a list of some of the most common breast cancer cases in the United States, with links to the most recent information.
1. Breast cancer: Breast cancer can cause a variety of health problems including:
1) increased risk of developing breast cancer
2) increased likelihood of developing skin cancer
3) increased susceptibility to breast cancers
4)

Expected Response: that issue revolves around what medication one will get during the procedure and whether or not these medications would enter the milk and then be passed to the infant. each medication that is given in the operating room and post-operatively has a history of whether or not it would be likely to enter into the mother’s milk. but frankly science is never 100% and i am very cautious and conservative. i don’t believe in taking any chances with the new baby and therefore i would suggest that if a mother is breastfeeding that the surgery be put off until breastfeeding is complete. the alternative would be for the mother to just stop breastfeeding for some period of time and not resume it until we are quite certain that all the medications have cleared from the system which is typically a matter of some days.

Question: pvc dildo not properly cleaned after anal use. can i still use it if i clean it? . i used a dido anally a few weeks back and i checked it today. it's a dildo with a syringe for squirting so it has a hole through it. it's made of pvc. when i checked it today there was something inside the hole for squirting that i can only assume was fecal matter. i want to avoid infections at all costs so is this toy safe to use if i clean it properly? should it now be used with a condom only andhow can i clean it to make it safe again? i have not used it again since i found this.
Baseline Response: yes.

Expected Response: pvc like silicone is non porous so if you clean it properly it will be safe. it's worthwhile to go to a smoke shop or craft store and pick up a pack of pipe cleaners they are perfect for going in that little hole and catching anything you need to. then fill the syringe with some rubbing alcohol and pass it through a few times clean the outside with more rubbing alcohol let it dry and you're good to go.

Question: can you have a bad tooth pulled and then wait a year to replace bone and have a dental implant inserted?
Baseline Response: we have a few options for this.
We can take the option of having a tooth removed every year. We can have a bone implant inserted and we can have the option to have a dentist's appointment, which is the same procedure we would do for any other person.
What we do is we wait a week for the implant to be inserted and then we take the time to go through the procedure.
When we take a bone or implant we do a lot of things to ensure that the implant is there.
I have always had a bad dental implant. It's a big problem and it's a lot easier to fix than the original one.
The problem is that if it gets broken, it's difficult to fix.
Our first option is to get the bone and then get a dentist appointment to replace it.
So if you're going

Expected Response: theoretically yes. but i believe it may be better to do the bone graft at the time of extraction. ask your dentist if there are any payment arrangement options that you can use to help you pay for the treatment you need.

Question: how exactly does the birth control pill work? how long does it take to become an effective use of contraception?
Baseline Response: the pill is an active contraceptive. It is not a contraceptive, but rather a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
Why is the pill not available to women who are not menstruating?
How do I get my pill?
Why do I need to pay for it?

Question: is it safe to take benadryl when you are seven months pregnant?
Baseline Response: I do not know.
In the past, I've been asked to take Benadryls when I was pregnant and I had no problem with that.
I was a little hesitant to take it when I got pregnant because I was worried that I'd be pregnant with my own child, but I have no regrets. I did take a lot of benadrine when I took my first pregnancy test, and I did it during my second pregnancy test. I didn't have a problem with it because I felt it was safe for me to take, but there is a certain risk that you could have an infection with some of it and that might happen if you have a history of having some type of urinary tract infection.
This is why I have always had a great interest in the benadication of birth control, and the fact that it is a safe and effective birth control option for

Expected Response: benadryl is listed as pregnancy category b and is safe to take. make sure you are using a product that only contains benadryl (diphenhydramine) and not any other ingredients. remember to follow the directions according to the labeled product or as your health care provider advises. if this medication is not working consult your ob-gyn to find a medication that is effective but still safe for your unborn baby.

================================================================================
Question: what are the different kinds of hives?
Baseline Response: the same kind of hive is used by the Japanese people to store water in their homes.
It is used in many different kinds, but this one is the most common.
When it is used as a vegetable, the hives are usually fried and boiled.
The hives can also be used as an appetizer.
What is the difference between a hive and a vegetable?
A hive consists of a large body of bones, a small body of flesh and skin, and a small head and neck. The bones and flesh are covered with a layer of flesh. The head and skin are covered by a layer called a puffy, white skin. The puffy skin is covered by the skin of the head. The skin is made of a thin layer of fat called a fatty.
In the same way, a vegetable contains the fatty, but it is not the same as a hives.

Expected Response: hives fall into two categories: acute urticaria (ordinary hives which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic urticaria (which continue longer than six to eight weeks). ordinary urticaria (ordinary hives) what are symptoms and signs of ordinary hives? ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. welts appear often in several places. they flare itch swell and go away in a matter of minutes to hours only to appear elsewhere. this sequence may go on from days to weeks. most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. although that cutoff point is arbitrary hives that last more than six weeks are often called "chronic. " what are the causes of ordinary hives? as noted above many cases of ordinary hives are "idiopathic " meaning no cause is known. others may be triggered by viral infections. a few may be caused by medications usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (it is uncommon for drugs taken continuously for long periods to cause hives or other reactions. ) when a medication is implicated as a cause of hives the drug must be stopped since no skin or blood test will prove the connection. in most cases drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. if a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away this is a strong indication that the medication was not in fact the cause of the hives. some medications like morphine codeine aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids such as ibuprofen [advil]) cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. despite the reputation hives have for being "allergic " when there is no obvious connection between something new that a person has been exposed to and the onset of hives allergy testing is not usually helpful. chronic hives chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. the evaluation of this condition is difficult and allergy testing and other laboratory tests are rarely useful in such cases. the accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history personal habits and oral intake. occasionally it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. certain systemic disease and infections may occasionally present in the skin as hives. if there is an inciting cause that can be determined then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective or in the case of food or drug allergy strict avoidance would be necessary. there are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. there are tests available to identify this type of hives. physical urticaria is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. by far the most common form is dermographism which literally means "skin writing. " this is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed: a red welt appears at the line of the scratch. in dermographism raised itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin causing mast cells to leak histamine. another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. this produces hundreds of small itchy bumps. these occur within 15 minutes of exercise or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. this form of hives happens more often in young people. other forms of physical hives are much less common. triggers for these include cold water and sunlight.

Question: what happens to someone when they get pneumonia?
Baseline Response: they get sick. They get sick and they get ill. There is no treatment for them. They do not get sick as a result of any disease. They are not given any medications. They have no other options. The only way to get them out of this situation is to get the best doctor available. I have no doubt that the best doctors are the ones who can do this. I believe that the only way for the best health care is to have a doctor who can treat them, and that is what I believe in.
If you are a patient who has not been treated for pneumonia for years and is not in the best position to go to the doctor who will treat you, please do not call me or anyone else for help. I am here to help you.
I am here because of the good work that I do and the great work that you do. I would like to thank you all for your

Expected Response: after you've been infected with a pneumonia -causing organism it takes as little as 1 to 3 days or as long as 7 to 10 days for symptoms to appear. how severe pneumonia is and how long it lasts depend on: your age and health. older sicker people usually have more severe cases and their pneumonia is more likely to have complications such as bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) or throughout the body (septicemia). whether bacteria or a virus caused the pneumonia. viral pneumonia usually is less severe than bacterial pneumonia. how quickly you treat it. the sooner you treat pneumonia the sooner symptoms go away. your immune system. people who have impaired immune systems are more likely to have more severe cases of pneumonia than people who have healthy immune systems. in healthy people pneumonia can be a mild illness that is hardly noticed and clears up in 2 to 3 weeks. in older adults and in people with other health problems recovery may take 6 to 8 weeks or longer. if you have severe pneumonia you may have to go to the hospital. in most cases of pneumonia you get in your daily life such as at school or work (community-based pneumonia) it is not necessary to go to the hospital. 1 about one-third of people with community-based pneumonia are age 65 or older. 1 older adults are treated in the hospital more often and stay longer for the condition than younger people. 1 pneumonia is more serious in this group because they often have and may develop other medical problems. 1 if your pneumonia is caused by a virus or bacteria you may spread the infection to other people while you are contagious. how long you are contagious depends on what is causing the pneumonia and whether you get treatment. you may be contagious for several days to a week. if you get antibiotics you usually cannot spread the infection to others after a day of treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Expected Response: salicylic acid is available at drug stores for wart removal. however if the wart is in a very callused place you may want to have your health care professional freeze the wart off with prescription-strength medication. sanding the skin down can flake off the wart and transfer it to another location on the body. seek medical advice for the quickest safest removal.

Question: can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever? . my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on. he won't go to a doctor because he does not have insurance. just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling "under the weather" for a few days. no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache. so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body.
Baseline Response: it is not.

Expected Response: whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (99. 9 oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!

Question: what is the difference between healthy and unhealthy fat?
Baseline Response: Healthy fat is healthy fat. If you're not in a good state, you're probably not in shape. If it's not healthy, you may not have the strength to lose weight.
When you're in a healthy state, your body is going to be able to take care of you. When you're unhealthy, your brain is going not to be doing that.
If you're overweight, your muscles are going to get weak and you will lose weight, but if you're healthy, your bones will be strong and you'll be able, without any surgery, to lose some weight. If the doctor says you're going to lose a lot of weight, he will not prescribe it to you.
Answer, "I'm going to tell you what you need to know about fat and how to lose fat without surgery. It's not going to work for you. It'll work for everybody. If I've

Expected Response: most food contains several kinds of fat and some are better for you than others. some fat is needed in your diet so it’s not a good idea to completely eliminate all fat. instead choose foods with healthier fats and enjoy them in moderation. unhealthy fats include saturated and trans fats (also called partially hydrogenated fats). sources of unhealthy fats come from eggs meat dairy and tropical oils (coconut palm and palm kernel oils). good fats include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. healthy fat sources include nuts seeds avocados olives and other plants. healthy oils aid in having healthy skin hair and a strong immune system. saturated fats and trans fats grams should be less than 10% of your total calories for the day. to determine the healthfulness of fat consider where it comes from -- animal vs. plant origin. healthy fats coming from plants (and fish) are beneficial for health especially when replacing saturated fat (animal fats) in the diet. at too high levels saturated fats can adversely affect heart health. saturated fats are found in high-fat meats full-fat dairy baked goods and fried foods. trans fat the worse fat of all is mostly found in products (i. e margarine) that contain vegetable oils that have been "partially hydrogenated" to become solid at room temperature. since 2006 fda requires companies to label trans fat in food products. if an item contains <. 5g it can be labeled "trans-fat free. "&nbsp; because the american heart association recommends 2g or less per day for the average 2000 calorie diet check the ingredient line for partially hydrogenated fats. &nbsp;for example &nbsp;natural peanut butter only has peanuts (and salt in some cases) in the ingredient line but other peanut butter products often contain partially hydrogenated oils and added sugar. &nbsp; for more on good and bad fats see this webmd article <link> while some dietary fats are good and some are bad; perhaps the worst is trans fat. this type of fat can occur naturally in animal products but is also the result of food manufacturers chemically altering oils through a process called hydrogenation. the reason that trans fat is so detrimental is because it not only raises bad (ldl) cholesterol levels but some research suggests that it also lowers our good (hdl) cholesterol levels as well – a double whammy. saturated fats on the other hand raise both good and bad cholesterol levels. common food sources of trans fat can include: • baked goods such as bread pizza dough and cake • fried foods such as french fries doughnuts or chicken nuggets • snack foods such as chips crackers cookies and candy • pre-packaged foods such as soup or frozen meals • margarines or spreads be cautious because the fda allows for food products to be labeled as “0 trans fat” even though there may be up to 0. 5 grams per serving. read this webmd article for more information: <link>. heathy fats come from healthy foods like nuts and unheathy fats come from fatty foods chips. healhty fats and polyunsaturated fats which help to get better healthy by removing cholestrol and unhealthy fats are saturated trans fats which increases the risk of heart attacks.
================================================================================
Question: is it true that using two condoms are better than one?
Baseline Response: yes, but only if you use the condom to prevent pregnancy.
This is a good point. The reason you need to use condoms is because there are certain things that can prevent pregnancy that you can't prevent.
For example, if you have unprotected sex, you might not want to have sex with a stranger. If you have sex outside the house, you're not going to want to go out with your family.
Also, you can use condoms when you are not in a relationship.
You can use a condom if you are pregnant, but you can only use condoms if you feel you're in a good place to do so.
So it's a good idea to use a condoms when it's safe to do it. If it's not safe to use it, it's probably not safe.
How to avoid pregnancy when using condoms
The most important thing you can do is to avoid

Expected Response: our society generally believes two is better than one. the problem is that the way condoms are designed using two condoms at the same time could actually do more harm than good. it could cause some friction between the condoms that could actually cause more breakage and leakage. so we like to let everyone know especially teens to keep it simple. just use one condom each and every time you have sex. viruses can get through some of the natural skin condoms so they don't protect against all sexually transmitted infections. we recommend the latex--or polyurethane which tend to be more expensive but need to be used by people who have latex allergies. it's important that teens recognize that the condom needs to be put on as soon as there’s an erection. not waiting until there's been a little foreplay because there's ejaculate that can be released that can cause both stds and unplanned pregnancies. even though it's so important to use a condom consistently and correctly many teens don't know how. health care providers teen clinics and educational materials can provide information on how to use a condom properly.

Baseline Response: no. there are no tests on the liver, pancrea, or kidneys.
Answer 3: Blood tests are not recommended for gallstones - blood tests are the best option.

Expected Response: blood tests on the pancreas and liver can come back normal and there could still be gallbladder trouble. the blood tests just show that the potential problem with the gallbladder hasn't started effecting the other organs yet. this situation happened to me as well. the ultrasound should give you much more info. good luck!
================================================================================
Question: what side effects could occur from suddenly stopping lexapro?
Baseline Response: as a result of the first few hours of sleep, your brain is a little bit more sensitive to the effects of drugs and sedatives. This may cause you to feel less awake, which may cause the effects to become more noticeable.
You may also experience a sense of being on edge, which can cause you not to be able to concentrate or concentrate as you are feeling dizzy. This is a common side effect of the drug, but not the only one.
Some people with sleep disorders also experience insomnia, which is a chronic insomnia disorder. This can cause a lack of sleep and sometimes even a sudden loss of consciousness.
In order to help you with the first couple of hours of your sleep, you need to take a sleep pill, which should help you get to a state where you can start feeling refreshed and well.
If you are having sleep problems, you may have some difficulty sleeping.

Expected Response: suddenly stopping a medication like lexapro can cause withdrawal effects which can lead to symptoms such as tiredness agitation confusion or a burning sensation. if you are experiencing any of these symptoms or any other bothersome symptoms you should contact your doctor.

Question: is herpes complex contagious if it is dormant in a person? . a grandmother who anually or biannually gets a cold sore. can she spread the herpes virus throughout the rest of the year?
Baseline Response: herpes complex is contagious if the virus is dormant for at least 6 months after the person's first infection. The virus can spread to other people, but if the person has a history of having a severe immune reaction or has been exposed to the virus for a long time, the virus can still spread to others.
How can herpes complex affect the immune system?
There is no cure for herpes complex, but a doctor can help you to determine if you have the virus.
If you have herpes complex in your body, you can get infected by your doctor. The infection can be spread by coughing or sneezing, and the virus may be transmitted by a close contact with a person.
What are the symptoms of herpes complex?
Symptoms of herpes simplex

Question: what are the different types of psoriatic arthritis?
Baseline Response: psoriatitis is a type of arthritis that is very difficult to treat. If you have psoriitis, you have a difficult time with your daily activities.
It is very important to be able to work with your psoriata. The best way to do this is by working with a specialist.
There are several different types and you will find that the best type of psoriasis is the one that is the most painful.
The first type is called psoriatura. It is a common type of disease that affects all of the joints, and it can be very painful to work on. The pain of the psorioma is very common, so it is important to know the types of symptoms that you may have.
If you have any of the following symptoms:
- You have a very painful psoriomas, usually on the back of your neck or head.
- Your

Expected Response: there are five types of psoriatic arthritis. it is important to know which type of psoriatic arthritis you have and to understand the characteristics so that it may be treated properly. symmetric psoriatic arthritis : symmetric arthritis affects the same joints -- usually in multiple matching pairs -- on opposite sides of the body. symmetric psoriatic arthritis can be disabling causing varying degrees of progressive destructive disease and loss of function in 50% of people with this type of arthritis. symmetric psoriatic arthritis resembles rheumatoid arthritis. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis : asymmetric arthritis typically involves one to three joints in the body -- large or small -- such as the knee hip or one or several fingers. asymmetric psoriatic arthritis does not affect matching pairs of joints on opposite sides of the body. distal interphalangeal predominant (dip) : distal interphalangeal predominant psoriatic arthritis involves primarily the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. dip psoriatic arthritis is sometimes confused with osteoarthritis a chronic disease that causes the deterioration of joint cartilage and bone as well as bone spurs at the joints. spondylitis : spondylitis affects the spinal column and may cause inflammation and stiffness in the neck lower back spinal vertebrae or sacroiliac region (pelvic area) making motion difficult. spondylitis also can attack connective tissue such as ligaments or cause arthritic disease in the joints of the arms hips legs or feet. arthritis mutilans : arthritis mutilans is a severe deforming and destructive form of psoriatic arthritis that primarily affects the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. this leads to lost function of the involved joints. it also is frequently associated with lower back and neck pain. fortunately this type of psoriatic arthritis is rare.

Question: how can exercise boost brainpower?
Baseline Response: exercise can. It has the potential to change our lives. Exercise can change our brainpower. It can change how we think and behave. It's not just about how much you do, it's about how many hours you have.
It's not about what you eat. It isn't about what your brain does. It is about how you live your life. Exercise is a powerful way to change the way we live our lives, the way our brains think.
I've been trained in a lot of different ways, but I've never been a "good" person. I've always had the same issues. I always had issues with my body and my mind.
If you want to get better at something, you need to learn from what you've done.
To learn from your mistakes, you've got to learn to take responsibility.
We have to be better about ourselves.
The first thing we have to

Expected Response: exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and helps it receive oxygen and nutrients. the better shape you're in the faster you fire brain waves that are responsible for quick thinking. so for example if math is a real problem you may find that daily exercise helps to solve it!

Question: my wife pulled both calf muscles in a triathlon 3 weeks ago. one of her calves still hurts. what should she do?
Baseline Response: she just should have been able to get her calf muscles back. she has been doing it for 2 weeks now.
How long did you do this?
It took me 1 day to do the whole cycle, which is pretty much all I've done since I started doing this.
Can I do this in the winter?
Yes. I've been doing this for 3 months now and I'm not even feeling any pain right now. I do have a few days where I get my calves back, but that's just to see if that'll help with my pain.
Do you have any other tricks or tricks you'd like to see me do? Do you want to try it out in the future?
I'd love to hear your ideas and opinions. I'm looking forward to hearing from you and I'd love if you

Expected Response: if it has been three weeks you should probably get this checked out by your physician. simple strains and sprains usually get better in three to five days.

Question: what is sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome?
Baseline Response: saphos is a condition that causes an increase in the level of inflammation in the skin and the amount of moisture in the air. It can occur when a person has a problem with a skin condition such as acne or psoriasis.
Symptoms of saphosis acne puho:
-increased pores, acne or skin irritation
-painful skin conditions, skin tenderness, and skin infections
-inflammation of the skin
-skin infections
The skin infections are often caused by the bacteria, fungi, or parasites in the food supply.
Causes of sappos:
The bacteria in the foods you eat can cause acne, psorosis, and inflammation in your skin.
Some of the bacteria that cause acne are:
• Borrelia burgdorferi, the common skin infection
• B

Expected Response: sapho (synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome is a chronic disorder that involves the skin bone and joints. synovitis means inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). typically this causes warmth tenderness pain swelling and stiffness of involved joints (arthritis). acne is a skin condition featuring tiny areas of inflammation with pus formation at the hair follicles. acne occurs most commonly on the face and upper back. pustulosis is a very inflammatory skin condition resulting in large fluid-filled blister-like areas (pustules) typically on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet. the skin of these areas peels and flakes (exfoliates). hyperostosis means abnormal excessive growth of bone. the hyperostosis of the sapho syndrome frequently is located at the points of the bone where tendons attach. osteitis means inflammation of the bone. patients with sapho syndrome can develop inflammation of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis) as well as inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) which leads to stiffness and pain of the neck and back.

Question: do facial exercise treatment "machines" really stimulate the muscles in the face and jaw line to tighten them? . i am a 62-year-old female with a sagging jaw line and neck. what can you tell me about this treatment?
Baseline Response: facial exercise therapy "mace" has been shown to increase the strength and endurance of the jaw muscles in patients with S. aureus and other skin diseases. It has also been shown that it can help to strengthen the facial muscles of the nose, throat and nose (pulmonary) areas (cranial, olfactory, and nasal). It is not known whether it can be used alone or in combination with other medications. In a randomized controlled trial of facial exercise in children with Scleroderma, the use of massage therapy was found to improve the strength, endurance, and muscle strength of the facial muscle of the head and neck (pilmonary).
The most common symptom of facial pain

Expected Response: the majority of visible wrinkles that we observe are due to extrinsic aging. extrinsic factors are associated with damage to the upper layers of the skin (epidermis or dermis) primarily from either sun damage or smoking. extrinsic aging cannot be corrected with facial exercises. i encourage daily exercise for your overall health and well-being. however "exercising" your facial muscles will not reverse skin damage or premature wrinkling due to extrinsic factors.

Question: 12 year old living in jamaica was born with umbilical hernia it's the size of a lemon. can /should it be left alone? . it causes him no pain. he says it has not changed in size since he can remember and it doesn't effect his physical activity. he is a very active kid. i think i should send him for surgery but when i saw the jamaican hospital i wonder if it is best to just leave it alone. what would you advise?
Baseline Response: 12year old living with umbile a little more than 12 years old is probably the best option. I would only recommend it if it will help him to have more sleep and to be able to play with his toys.
Answer 2: 12 yr old living and getting a vasectomy can cause problems. its the size that you can only imagine. Its the size you can imagine. its just a matter of size. its not really that big, its just that tiny

Expected Response: get it fixed. an umbilical hernia the size of a lemon has the potential of becoming incarceration (trapping a loop of intestine - a medical emergency). it can be a problem with sports and is cosmetically unappealing for a 12-year old boy who would rather develop six-pack abs than have a big bulge on his tummy that causes unwanted attention and ridicule from other teenager. a teenagers body image can be fragile so why not fix this minor problem?
================================================================================
Question: i take zoloft. is it safe to take an over-the-counter cold medicine?
Baseline Response: Zoloft is a natural supplement that helps protect against the harmful effects of colds. It is also a great way to take a cold medicine for your own health.
1. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about your body's response to colds and your options for treating them.
2. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a cold medication for you.
3. Your body may be unable to protect against colds or other diseases.
4. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor may prescribe cold medications for you as a way to treat that disease.
5. Your doctors may also prescribe medicines that prevent or treat colds, such as antihistamines, antidiuretics, and anti-diseases.
6. Your health care provider may recommend a cold therapy that is safe for you, but not

Expected Response: yes. most over-the-counter cold medications are safe to take with zoloft. you should check with your pharmacist who can recommend the best product for you that will help your specific symptoms and not interact with your prescription medications.
================================================================================
Question: how far in does your lover have to go inside your vaginal area in order to recognize that you have lost your vaginity?
Baseline Response: The way to do this is to tell him that your lover is not inside you and that your vagina is not very well lubricated.
If you want to know more about how to do that, I recommend you read this post by the author of a wonderful book called "Sex and the Body: How to Take a Bath and Gently Do It".
It's also worth reading this post about how you can "make your lover feel" if you tell him to put his hand over his vagina, or if you give him a hand massage.
This is what I found out about my lover when I told him to stop doing it.
I would say that if you're in a relationship, you should be comfortable with it and not have to worry about it. I'm not saying that it is always a bad thing to be in a

Expected Response: why do you really care? the presence of an intact hymen (located at the vaginal opening) is not a definitive sign of virginity since the hymen can spontaneously rupture from riding a bike riding a horse or using a tampon. a male who is getting this close to your vagina does not likely have the medical skills to make any type of determination. at this point men are more interested in just having sex. you have the right to keep your secrets or share them. that is your decision.

Question: who pays most for junk cars? . krot bil pris skrotpræmie danmark vi udbetaler højeste skrotpræmie for din skrotdin bil vi betaler kontant for skrot bil og dækker hele landet biler. <link>
Baseline Response: I would like to ask you about your own personal habits. In the past, I have used my phone to call my mom, but my best friend has been using the internet to call me. I am a bit of a geek, so I am very active on the internet. The internet is a great resource for finding new things to do.

My friends and I have been playing around with different things on the net. One of them is "trucks". We are in the process of building a truck and it will be the first time we will use it. I have found that people are really open to sharing

Expected Response: please. please. refrain from using webmd medical sites for your advertising. your inappropriate postings take up valuable space for people seeking answers to their medical concerns. be respectful.

Question: my daughter has scabies shes scared she has to throw away all of her stuffed animals. help please. how do i save them? . she was diagnosed today. the animals cant be washed. what do i do? is there a spray or something that can be used on her bed as well?
Baseline Response: A spray is a chemical that is applied to the skin. The spray may be applied directly onto the skin causing it to become irritated. It is very difficult to get rid of it. The best way to get it off is to use a topical spray and wash your hands thoroughly.
A topical spray is not an actual spray but is a small amount of liquid that is placed on the skin which is then applied directly to the area of the skin that is affected. The amount of the spray is determined by the size of the area affected and will vary depending on the size and size of your cat.
What does a topical cream do?
A cream can be

Expected Response: she does not have to discard her stuffed animals. scabies is an insect parasite that lives under the skin. scabies must feed on blood in order to survive and stuffed animals do not have blood. just wash the sheets in hot water and put them in a hot dryer. spray the bed with an effective insecticide that covers scabies. put the stuffed animals in a plastic bag for a week or so. if any stray scabies somehow were on those toys they would starve to death quickly.

Question: what is the standard charge for cpt code 19081. i had a stereotactic needle biopsy of a breast (cpt code 19081) and the provider billed the insurance company $6 000. this seems really exhorbitant for a simple needle biopsy. i've been attempting to find out if this is a realistic charge for this procedure.
Baseline Response: no.
Cpt code 1902 is a standard charge.
The standard charge is $6,000. a "reasonable" charge for a needle biopsis is $100,000 for a biopsy which is a "normal" charge. I can't find any documentation on this.
I'm guessing the provider paid the insurance and the patient did not.
That is a great question, but it is not a standard or a standard code.
Update:
I have an example of the needle bioplastics being performed on a breast.
Source: http://www.tac

Expected Response: unfortunately there is no standard charge. however there are some price transparency tools that can help give you an idea. if you get insurance at work check to see if your employer offers one. your insurer may also have a pricing tool. and then there are sites such as fairhealthconsumer. org healthbluebook. com and newchoicehealth. com. these generally offer you pricing information based on past insurance claims submitted in your area. hospitals are contracted with insurance companys. hospitals can charge whatever they want. but insurances tell the hospital "per contract" what the hospital is allowed to charge. then the hospital does the contractual "adjustment" and writes off the difference. i. e. : bx costs $20 000. insurance says no contracted rate is $4 000. hospital writes off $16 000 and bills insurance the $4000. every insurance has a contracted rate for the procedure. again the insurance tells the hospital what it's allowed to charge. one insurance says hospital can bill $4000 another says contracted rate is $5000 another says contracted rate is $3000. so it all really depends on what insurance policy you have and what your insurance states the hospital can charge. bc al allowable is $909. 93 and medicare allowable is $ 606. 62

Question: what is the single best thing i can do to keep my skin’s youthful appearance?
Baseline Response: I think it's the best thing that i can. I know i will be able to stay healthy without any problems, but the fact that i will have to wear a lot of makeup every day (not to mention the fact it's like a whole lot of other things), and that i'll be able do it with no effort, is really awesome.


I would recommend that you look into how you look at your body to see if you can maintain your appearance and make your skin feel like a normal person. If you are worried about your appearance, look at the following images:

Question: how much vitamin d is recommended?
Baseline Response: I think it's really important to know that a high amount of vitamin D is necessary for your body to make vitamin D, especially if you're having a vitamin D deficiency.
In a study published in 2012, the National Institute of Health (NIA) and the National Institutes of Health determined that a single dose of 400 IU of vitamin d per day would provide up to 2,500 IU of total vitamin D.
The researchers also found that a low dose of vitamin E (100 IU per day) would increase your risk of developing vitamin D deficiencies.
What's more, in a 2011 study published online in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the researchers found that vitamin E supplementation resulted in a 15% lower risk of vitamin C deficiency compared to placebo.
If you're concerned about your vitamin D levels, you should definitely try the Vitamin D D D Calculator.
How much vitamin D can I get from a low-dose vitamin

Expected Response: since the 1930s when milk was first fortified with vitamin d to prevent rickets the usual recommendation has been 200 iu to 400 iu daily during times of inadequate sun exposure. women above age 50 should be receiving 400 iu to 800 iu. recently experts in the area have been lobbying for a new recommended level of 1 000 iu daily among adults. the food and nutritional board at the institute of medicine began reviewing the published studies in 2008. . . for comparison the upper tolerable limit (adverse results begin to appear) has been reputed to be 2 000 iu/day. many researchers in the field have suggested that the toxic level is closer to 10 000 iu/day over a more prolonged period of time.

Question: are there any health insurance companies that cover provigil for daytime sleepiness?
Baseline Response: yes, there are. Some states have different requirements for these services, but they are typically based on your own personal medical history and the availability of certain medications. You can find more information on how to get started.

Expected Response: you need to review each of the plans' drug formularies or list of covered drugs to find one that meets your specific needs.

Question: i've been told premiums for health insurance through the exchange will be 2-3 times more than what i currently pay. as of now i have cobra insurance payments that cost more than $1100 for two adults. what can you tell me about this?
Baseline Response: As of now I'm getting a premium of $12,000 and a 2-year deductible of $4,000.
Answer 2: Is this a scam or a scam?

Expected Response: you can't know what insurance will cost you personally until you begin shopping or plug your information into a cost calculator like the one provided by webmd: <link>. if you're currently paying for cobra it's quite likely a plan purchased through the exchange will cost less. the notion that a health plan for two people will cost $2 200 or $3 300 per month sounds highly unlikely. if you qualify for a subsidy your costs will be significantly lower. start shopping on healthcare. gov and see for yourself what your options are.

Question: can toenail fungus cause fatigue and dizziness? . i have been extremely fatigued and get dizzy a lot any can not figure out what is causing it. i have been to the dr a few times for it and had blood work done ( thyroid iron cbc b12 cmp a1c) and everything has come back normal. i feel like a zombie. i get plenty of sleep most nights 7 hrs. i have had a fungus or something on my left big toenail for a couple yrs and i'm wondering if that could be causing me to feel like crap.
Baseline Response: Answer #1: I have seen some people who have a fungus on their toenails and that is because they have a bad toenai. I can't get them to stop. I have to put them on the bed, I have had to put a pillow on my back because I couldn't get to it and I can feel it on my feet.

Expected Response: toenail fungus will not cause systemic symptoms but if your immune system is somewhat weak or challenged you would be more prone to getting a fungal infection. this would be the only likely association. if you feel poorly it is not due to the toenail issue.
================================================================================
Question: how can you determine a high ferritin serum level other than a blood test or liver biopsy? i have no insurance.
Baseline Response: you can find a blood or urine test for the presence of a high/low ferritins level in your blood. It is the result of a normal biochemical reaction. A normal blood test is a blood sample taken after you have taken a blood transfusion. If you have a normal blood transfuse, the blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis and the results are used to determine a higher ferritination level. A test for high ferrite levels is usually done at the end of a long-term blood transfusions, and then a test for low ferrite level is done at least a few years after the blood transfusing.
How do I know if I have high ferrites? The first thing you should know about ferrite is that it is a very small molecule in your body. It has a small amount of its

Expected Response: a serum ferritin level is a blood test. it is not very expensive. there are no other ways to determine this level.

Question: how long will lorazepam stay in my urine for a drug test. i have read online anywhere from 3 days to a month. from the information i have lorazepam gets out of ur system faster then any other benzo and people are mixing it up with xanx or valium thinking it will stay in your system just as long. obviously some people don't know what their talking about and some do i just dont know who. your information would be greatly appreciated. thanks
Baseline Response: It will be tested and if it is positive for loroxepam it will be sent back to you.
Answer to: What is the most important information you have about loraxepam? I know many of you are curious about this topic and have been asking me about it for a while. This is your question. I am not sure what you are looking for. You can find your answer here: http://www.dontknow.com

Expected Response: i guess a better question is: are you self-medicating with lorazepam? are you in a job classification (such as cdl driver) in which you're not supposed to be taking lorazepam? because otherwise why are you concerned about it showing up on a drug test? if you don't have a valid prescription for lorazepam you shouldn't be taking it. no one should self-medicate with a prescription drug. likewise if you're in a job that prohibits the use of certain substances you shouldn't be using them. doing so exhibits a reckless disregard for the safety of yourself and others. if you have anxiety or sleep problems see a doctor for a help. if you have a substance abuse problem please seek appropriate treatment.

Question: one side of the mouth drooping and it is getting worse. eye also droops. is this a womens health concern
Baseline Response: No it is not a womans health concern. It is a medical condition. We don't know why they are getting worse but we have a very good understanding of it. It can cause inflammation in the body, it can cause itchy eyes and it can also cause it to move around.
Why is this happening?
There are two reasons:
1) The body is making its own immune system. The body has to deal with the infection from the infection. 2) The virus is inside the body. The virus spreads and is spreading in the blood.
It is easy to see why this is happening. The people who are infected with the virus are immune. They do not need to be injected. If they need to, they can be injected, they do not have to be taken.
So the virus is in the bloodstream

Expected Response: this may be a neurological problem that can affect men or women. this could be a condition called bell's palsy but there can be other causes. please see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
================================================================================
Question: what should i know before i start taking penicillin g procaine?
Baseline Response: - I am not allergic to procaine.
My doctor said that procaine should be taken at least once a day.
That is why I took penicin.
And I'm not allergic.
So I take penicitin daily.
Do you know that procain is not taken for an allergic reaction?
I don't know.
I think that procane is not considered as a penicil for an anaphylactic reaction.
But that is what I am saying.
Why not take penitin at least twice a day for anaphytic reaction. I don't have any problem with procain.
When I took procaine, I didn't want to take pencins. I just wanted to take

I am trying to get her some medication and have had a lot of fun. . I have had some family

Expected Response: your mother needs to be seen by a psychiatrist so that she can be properly evaluated. yes there are medications that may help but these will need to be prescribed for her by a clinician that is very familiar with the type of dementia that she has and someone who knows her complete medical history.

Answer to: the bp is a large one and i am not sure what to do about it but i did a checkup on my bs last year so i know it's normal.

Expected Response: all blood pressures vary. in everyone everyday. the most important aspect is that your average blood pressure should be within normal range and those occasional high ones carefully monitored. there are hundreds of reasons why blood pressures fluctuate but always check with your regular medical provider if those high reading continue.
================================================================================
Question: what over the counter drug can i use to dilate my pupils
Baseline Response: for a short time, the best way to dilatorate your pupils is to take a small amount of a drug that has a high concentration of a compound called metoclopramide.
This drug can be given as a powder, or in a medicine capsule.
For a long time, it was known as benzodiazepines.
I started taking it as a prescription. I knew that I was going to have to use it daily for at least three months.
My doctor told me that it was not a good idea to take this drug for a long period.
So I took it for three months and took it daily.
When I got back to my doctor, she told me to take it at least once a week.
It worked.
She said that it would help me to focus more on my reading and writing.
Now I've read a lot about this drug

Expected Response: why would you want to do this? there are no over-the-counter drugs that would be appropriate.

Question: is coffee bad for your teeth?
Baseline Response: yes
Answer from the Dr. John K. Kagan:
"I don't know, but I can tell you this, that the best coffee you can get for your mouth is from a bottle. I have had great success with the "bud" and the "cocoa" brands. I think the difference between the two is that they are made with a little bit of cocoa and a little more sugar. The sugar is also very good, and is the best you can buy at the grocery store. I've been able to get a bottle of the brand and a bottle with the cocoa, and it's been a great experience."
Answer to the question "How long does it take to get into a coffee shop?" from the National Coffee Association of America:
Answer : 3-5 years.
Answer From the Dr John Kagan of the National Research Council:
 "I have been using a regular coffee

Expected Response: coffee stains the teeth. but such stains can be polished off. the sweeteners that many people use in their coffee are far more dangerous for the teeth as they feed the bacteria that create cavity-causing acids in the mouth. caffeine interferes with natural saliva production which can cause dry mouth and also lead to tooth decay.
================================================================================
Question: are certain foods linked with healthy skin? i was told that oatmeal is good for the skin; is that true?
Baseline Response: yes. The question is whether oatmeal provides an antioxidant.
The answer is no.
In fact, oatmeal may not be a good vitamin for your skin.
Oatmeal is not a "good" vitamin.
So, you are not going to get the benefits of vitamin C from oatmeal.
If you are worried about the health of your skin, you can try oatmeal or other supplements like Vitamin C.
Do you get the "saturated fat" you want?
Yes, but it is not saturated fat.
And if you are concerned about your skin's health, you should use a vitamin C supplement like Vitamin A, Vitamin C B or Vitamin E.
What is the difference between vitamin C and vitamin C?
The difference is that vitamin C is an essential nutrient.
Why is vitamin C essential?

Expected Response: healthy foods help your skin become healthy also. skin is made up of proteins. so lean proteins are necessary in your diet. examples include lean chicken fish and tofu if you’re a vegetarian. fresh fruits like papaya and blueberries and fresh vegetables and whole grains also contribute to healthy skin. hydration also helps your skin fight off signs of age.

Question: should a male with enlarged breasts wear a bra? . a male friend of mine said he was considering wearing a bra due to the extreme size of his enlarged breasts. he is slightly overweight but not obese the problem is he could probably fill a d cup easily. he complains of shoulder and back pain daily. he has been living with this problem for years since his teens and is tired of trying to hide it but he doesn't have health insurance for any type of surgery. so should he wear a bra for this issue?
Baseline Response: What I'm saying is that if you are going to have a big breasts and you are a woman and you want to be a good fit, you need to wear a bikini. I'm not saying that you should be wearing a bikini or that it should be the only thing you should do if you're going to lose weight. I am saying that if it's the only way you will lose weight, and if it is the only option you will

Baseline Response: yes, he was casted on the 10th day. I'm not sure how long he had to wait for the swelling to stop. I've seen some of the doctors who are casting and they are very concerned about the swelling. I don't know how long it will take to cast him.
Answer - I would wait for it to heal.

Expected Response: not necessarily. we often wait a week or so before casting. if you put a snug cast on a freshly-injured area the cast will not fit properly when the swelling goes down and even worse. if the area started to swell more this could compromise the blood flow to the feet/toes. many will put the person in a special boot instead of a cast but that depends on the fracture. there are many types of ankle fracture; some are more stable than others. if your doctor feels that a plate is needed this may be because this fracture is unstable. because the ankle is a weight-bearing joint there are many considerations when it comes to managing these fractures. your son should be totally on crutches with no weight-bearing and hopefully he has not had subsequent injury in the last week since the original fracture was diagnosed (this can happen). a comparison x-ray may be required. hi there is no way we can tell you via the internet whether this treatment was appropriate or not as all injuries and people are different. here is some information on ankle injuries that may be helpful. if you feel like your son's treatment was not taken care of properly you may want to have another doctor examine him in person for a second opinion. the webmd answers staff

Expected Response: most helpful answer masturbation will not change the diameter or overall size of your penis. frequent ejaculation will decrease your sperm volume and sperm count but only temporarily. masturbation is considered safe but if you feel the need to masturbate 15 times per day you need to find another hobby. the most obvious effect is skin damage. i mean thing like chafing dryness soreness and even a loss of sensitivity. these all negatively impact one's sex life so you definitely should use a penis health creme every morning. these are made to protect the penis from masturbation-induced issues. they work very well. i use one called man1 man oil. you should check it out. hope this helps.

Question: can this overwhelming hunger feeling to the point of being nauses be a sign of being pregnante? . this started around 7pm on 6/17/2013 and has not stopped even with food and water.
Baseline Response: no, the hunger is the result of being hungry. the reason is that you are hungry and your body is not producing enough food. The hunger is just a result of your being hungry and having a baby.

Expected Response: sometimes it could also be a sign of bulimia unless you are on a steroid packet or some birth control pills with cause a large amount of hunger try sticking to small meals every two to four hrs and see if that helps you might also want to get checked for bulimia and other things. i know you may think that your not forcing you self to throw up but that's not all bulimia is about. i had a friend of mine that had it and never thought of herself as fat or forced herself to throw up. my x husband would eat so much that his stomach would swell and now he has pancreatitis so you could get that looked at to just to be on the safe side. that can be curable with the right diet and meds.

Question: went for 6 mth mammo after surgery. still need needle biopsy in same place. why wasnt this removed during surgery? . radiologist said there is still a piece at the biopsy site. i dont understand why this wasnt removed during surgery. is it necessary to do this biopsy? i have an appt with my surgeon but not sure how much i trust her now. the biopsy came back negative 6 mths ago.
Baseline Response: went to my doctor today and did a thorough biopsy. he said it was a negative, but it wasn't. i was told i was fine. he also said he will do a biopsy on the other patient. but the doctor told me i am fine. so i went to go see my doctor. i didn't hear back.
Now that I have the information, i will take care of it.

Expected Response: i wish that i could answer your question but to blindly comment on a prior surgery would be impossible since i do not know the medical details of your case. only your surgeon can address this issue. please keep in mind that cancer does not always "stand out" and be obvious during surgery so it is possible that a tiny piece was missed. i really can't say but at least the follow-up mammogram spotted "something". this "something" may not necessarily mean a "piece of cancer" since there can be many artifacts that mimic a suspicious reading. it is up to you to trust your doctor but medicine is far from 100% perfect 100% of the time. i am sure you will receive an explanation from your doctor. i wish you the very best.

Question: my tsh is6. 66 and my t4 is 0. 84 after taking synthyroid 25mcg for 6 months what should i do?
Baseline Response: I think you need to take some extra steps to get your tsh down. If you have a t4 or t5 and you have an extra tsh in your t4 you may need to go back to synthyrex and try to get a little more synthy.
Answer #3: Synthyroid can get you high on drugs that can lead to serious side effects.

Expected Response: your tsh result indicates you still have an underactive thyroid gland despite taking extra thyroid hormone (synthroid). the healthcare provider probably will be in touch with you to adjust your medication dosage. in the meantime you shouldn't do anything. you should never adjust your medications on your own. if you don't hear from the doctor who ordered your recent blood test be sure to call to make a follow-up appointment. the "reference range" for normal tsh values has been the subject of debate in recent years but a tsh level over 6. 0 clearly is high. this indicates the combination of thyroid pills plus the amount of thyroid hormone produced by your own thyroid gland still is low. don't worry. it can take quite some time to fine-tune the dosage of thyroid medication. and while a sluggish thyroid can be a nuisance it's not likely to have any life-threatening effects. wishing you well!

Question: no allergy to shellfish. ct scan w/contrast-mild reaction of hives. would there be allergic reaction to shell fish now?
Baseline Response: yes. c. Could you please explain why the reaction to the shellfish is so severe?
Solution: there are a few reasons why a person would react to shell food. First, the shell may be very hard to digest, and the food may have some preservatives. Second, the food might be very thick, and this might create a problem for the person who eats it. Third, the reaction is very rapid and the person may not be able to absorb the food quickly enough. Fourth, the person might feel very ill and may be unable to eat the food. Finally, the foods are very expensive to buy, and it is difficult to get a good quality shellfish if you don't have the money to buy a good variety.

Question: my daughter is 18 and for some reason she has been very tired and sluggish but very hungry what could be the problem? . when i cook at home i try and cook healthy food. though with her having a job and a car she has her own money and a way to get a lot of fast food. also since this cycle of hunger and sleepiness has occurred her body has been having pains off and on. are these related and could fast food be the problem?
Baseline Response: Yes, this is true but in the case of the children who are fed the most, it is not the only problem. In the case that you have a large number of kids, it could be that they are not being fed enough. As they are in their early 20s, they are hungry and tired and need some food. For instance, a child who is born with a severe obesity needs to have a lot more food in the first few days of life. It is not that there is no

Expected Response: the tiredness and aches and pains could be caused by a variety of factors. i would start with a physical and blood work. it is not uncommon for young women to be iron deficient which could be causing her to be tired. you also want to check her vitamin d levels which can be low even when diet is healthy. as for the pains its hard to tell. fast food daily would be a problem nutritionally but if she eats it less often it may not. some things you can do is talk to her about her food choices when eating out. and make a point to have family meals even if she gets home late let her know the food will be waiting and have one parent eat with her. your daughter is an adult now and it's time for her to take charge of her health. have her help prepare meals understand her nutritional needs and guide her to make good food choices. this article provides more information on diet for teens. good luck!

Question: how can exercise help my sleep?
Baseline Response: exercise helps your sleep. Your body gets tired. You can't walk. You're tired. Your muscles can't move. You lose your balance. Your joints will be weakened. Your heart rate can't go up. Your blood sugar will go down. Your brain can't process information. Your sense of smell will be affected. Your nose and throat will be numb. Your teeth will be tired.
What you need to know:
When you exercise, your body will become fatigued. Your metabolism will be impaired. Your appetite will be low. Your thirst will be high. Your nausea will be moderate. Your headaches will be severe. Your sleep will be very light. Your mood will be pleasant. Your nervous system will be relaxed. Your immune system will not be affected by exercise. Your gut will not feel the need for exercise.
You need to see your doctor or an expert before you start exercising. Your doctor will recommend

Expected Response: so exercise and sleep there’s significant amount of data to show that a regular amount of exercise will help with sleep specifically increasing deep sleep. so one of the questions when we talk about working with the boomers and people who are in that age range is that if they can get daily exercise it will actually help increase their overall sleep. do you want to exercise right before bed? well that’s a great question and the data is very mixed on this. i have some patients who are what i call type-a personalities and pretty anxious folks. i actually have them exercising before bed which isn’t something that is usually recommended because for them exercise causes a relaxation response. so for them it’s perfect to exercise before bed. i have other patients people who are a little bit more melancholy and blue where exercise actually gives them energy so these people i have them exercising in the morning. so it really depends upon your overall personality type to know and understand when you should exercise. but overall i definitely recommend exercise for sleep.

Question: what causes back pain in pregnant women?
Baseline Response: it's related to an imbalance of testosterone, which is a hormone that regulates muscle mass and muscle strength. If a woman is pregnant, her body gets a little more testosterone than it needs. This is why it's a good idea to have a blood test to see if you have a problem with back pain.

Expected Response: there are many possible reasons pregnant women may experience back or spinal pain. here are some of the more likely causes: weight gain. during a healthy pregnancy women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. this added weight must be supported by the spine which can result in discomfort in your lower back. further the weight of the growing baby and uterus puts pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back. changes in posture. as your uterus becomes heavier your center of gravity changes. you may gradually -- perhaps without noticing -- begin to adjust your posture and the way you move. this may result in back pain or strain. hormone changes. during pregnancy your body produces a hormone called relaxin that allows ligaments in the pelvic area to relax and the joints to become looser in preparation for the birth process. the same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to loosen leading to instability and pain. muscle separation. as the uterus expands two parallel sheets of muscles (the rectal abdominis muscles) which run from the rib cage to the pubic bone may separate along the center seam. this separation may worsen back pain. stress. emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back which may be felt as back pain or back spasms. you may find that you experience an increase in back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy.

Answer
Answer : I was in a panic and just started to cry. i felt like i was going to die. i ran to the bathroom but i was too scared to go to the toilet. i went to the shower to wash my face and just tried to get into the shower. i

Expected Response: yes it is possible you are pregnant. a female of any age is fertile and capable of getting pregnant if she has already had even one period. pulling out only stops the main ejaculation dear there is what is called "pre-ejaculate" that comes out before he has his main ejaculation which happens during orgasm. there can be sperm present in this pre-ejaculate and you can get pregnant from it. pre-ejaculate can come out anytime during sex before he orgasms and ejaculates fully. i'm not gonna tear you down and tell you what a bad girl you've been. you made a choice and now you have to figure it out. it's extremely important that you do the following two things. first you need to see a doctor. even if this boy says he has never had sex with anyone else he could be lying. people lie. boys lie even more frequently when sex is added to the equation. so you need to see a doctor and get an std test. std's just sounds like a scary word but we're talking about possibly life-threatening diseases that can kill you if left untreated. not to mention you could accidentally give them to someone else and hurt them. second you need to take precautions if you are going to continue to be sexually active. there is no excuse for a boy not to show up with condoms. if your boyfriend shows up without several condoms knowing full well you are going to have sex then you need to turn him away at the door and tell him to come back when he has some condoms. if he really cares about you he'll find a way to get some. they give them away for free all over the country. it's not hard. and you can go ahead and let him be responsible for that. it's his sperm that'll be causing any problems so he needs to get himself in order if he wants the privilege of your company. i'm sad that i have to tell you this but this is the world in which we live: you never let a boy con you or manipulate you into unprotected sex. and they will try. they will try every day until they realize you won't stop saying no. you must be responsible for your own body because no one else will be.

Baseline Response: you can get a free prescription and buy insurance if you have to pay for it. If you have any questions or want to contact me, email me at: dr.j.g.dwitt@gmail.com or call me at (202) 854-7242.

Expected Response: if you're unemployed and can't find a health plan that you can afford (one that costs no more than 8% of your income) you will be exempt. however the good news is that as someone without an income you'll qualify for steep subsidies to dramatically lower the cost of insurance. and if you live in a state expanding its medicaid program you may qualify for that as well which will provide you with insurance at no cost.

Question: what causes celiac disease?
Baseline Response: celiac is a disease of the nervous system, which is the result of a genetic mutation that results from the mutation of the gene for the enzyme that breaks down gluten. The mutation of gluten causes a condition called gluten intolerance, or gluten intolerance in which the body's immune system has to fight off the disease. In celiac patients, there are no symptoms.
This condition is called "lack of concentration," and it is caused by an abnormal amount of gluten.
When a person is not celiac, they can't have their head or eyes open or their body has trouble breathing. In other words, they are not able to eat.
How much gluten are there in your diet?
The amount of celiac gluten is usually between 1-5 grams.
You should be able to digest more than one gram of gluten in one sitting, which can make up to five grams of gluten a day.
What are the signs

Expected Response: the destruction of the inner lining of the small intestine in celiac disease is caused by an immunological (allergic) reaction to gluten in the diet that inflames and destroys the inner lining of the small intestine. there is evidence that this reaction is partially genetic and inherited. thus approximately 10% of first-degree relatives (parents siblings or children) of individuals with celiac disease also will have celiac disease. in addition in approximately 30% of fraternal twins and 70% of identical twins both twins will have celiac disease. finally certain genes have been found to be more common among individuals with celiac disease than among individuals without celiac disease. gluten is a family of proteins present in wheat. some of the proteins that make up gluten (the ones that are dissolved by alcohol) are called gliadin. it is the gliadin in gluten that causes the immunological reaction in celiac disease. the mechanism whereby gliadin becomes toxic (damaging) is not clear; however much scientific study is being done and we are beginning to understand the mechanism. proteins including gliadin are long chains of amino acids-up to several hundred--attached to each other. normally during digestion digestive enzymes within the small intestine break-up proteins into single amino acids and smaller chains of amino acids. this is necessary because the intestine only can absorb single amino acids or at most chains of 3-4 amino acids. single amino acids and chains of several amino acids do not cause problems for the intestine. it appears however that gliadin is not completely broken-up by intestinal enzymes. several longer chains of amino acids remain intact. somehow these larger chains enter the cells lining the intestine perhaps because the cells are abnormally permeable (leaky) to longer chains of amino acids. some of these longer chains are toxic (damaging) to the intestinal cells. one of the longer chains attaches to an enzyme within the cells tissue transglutaminase. in individuals with celiac disease the complex of the longer chain of amino acids and tissue transglutaminase sets off an immune reaction that attacks the complex and at the same time damages the intestinal cells. barley and rye contain gliadin-like proteins and can cause celiac disease in genetically-predisposed individuals. oats also contain gliadin-like proteins but unlike barley and rye the gliadin-like proteins in oats cause inflammation weakly and in only a few individuals who are predisposed to develop celiac disease. rice and corn do not cause celiac disease because they do not contain gliadin-like proteins.

Question: can you get sick from a fan? . we do not have any air conditioning in our home so we leave the ceiling fan on all night. someone told me that our 4 month old baby can get sick from leaving the fan on is that true? she doesn't wake up feeling cold to the touch in fact she is always sweaty when she wakes up because it's so miserably hot in our house.
Baseline Response: no, it's not. If you want to get sick, don't leave the fan off. If it's already too hot to see the light, it might not be the fan. It's the fan that is making the noise.

Expected Response: hi i think you find its just an old wives tail if you think about it how. ok good luck

Question: i have a shooting pain on the side of my face. ibuprofen has not helped. what do you suggest?
Baseline Response: i am using ibuproside to help alleviate my pain. ibepen is not effective in my case. it works well, but i am not sure what to do with it.
Answer to

Expected Response: due to the fact that you have tried ibuprofen and that did not seem to help i am concerned with the level of pain that you are having and the area that you are having it in and strongly suggest that you see a health care provider for further evaluation. it could be a sign of an infection and it is very important that you have this looked at. thanks for submitting a question today.

Baseline Response: I am not pregnant. I am a 27 year old single mum. I don't have any problems with my husband or my boyfriend, but if i had to choose a partner, i would have to look after my baby, and if i don't want to, i will have to deal with the fact that I am pregnant.
I am not a single mum, I have had 4 babies in my life. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 15 yr old son. I know that I have been through some ups and downs, but

Question: how should someone stop taking xanax? what is the proper way so that they don't experience all of the hardcore symptoms.
Baseline Response: I don't know. I'm not sure what to think about it. I do know that it's a really hard pill to take, and I'm still not sure if I should take it or not. I'll have to read more on that in a bit.
Update: I'm doing some research and am in the process of reading some of the comments on this post. I've got a couple of questions that need to be answered.
1. Why are some people taking xanthine? What is the dose? 2. What is xanthin?
3. I think I'm going to be on xanex for a bit, so I'm looking forward to that.
4. I didn't think xanx was the right drug for me. I thought it was a very bad drug, and it

Expected Response: unfortunately i do not know how much xanax you are taking. how long you have been taking it. or the reason you are using this sedative drug. you will need to discuss this with the medical professional who is prescribing it to you -- someone who knows you and your particular case. many people will start reducing the amount they are taking. cutting the pills in half for instance but again i am reluctant to advise you in this matter due to the lack of specifics. i am confident that your medical provider will help you.

Question: is it safe to take inderal topamax imitrex hydrocodone limbitrol and yaz birth control for my migraines?
Baseline Response: it is time to take the pill.
Answer/Answer to: it will not take effect.
Issue: is there any pain relief to be found in the indral cream?
Issue/Answer/

Expected Response: it is not uncommon to take birth control to help regulate hormone cycles preventative medications to prevent the onset of a migraine (topamax inderal limbitrol) and symptomatic relief medications (imitrex) all together. hydrocodone basically covers up the pain. to take three preventative medications along with everything else you listed does seem like a bit much. i would look at lifestyle modifications that you could possibly make in order to aid in the decrease of migraine frequency. i would also seek another medical opinion from a migraine specialist or neurologist to see if all these medications are necessary. keep in mind that a few of these medications have side effects of headaches which could be a trigger to worsen or cause your migraines.

Question: is it safe to feed meat and yogurt to my 9-month-old?
Baseline Response: Yes, but I don't recommend it. It's not safe.
Meal Preparation
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup baby spinach (or baby spinach with spinach)
1 egg
1 green pepper, chopped
3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, softened

Expected Response: i generally recommend that my patients start introducing proteins (such as meat and dairy) at about 7 months -- assuming that there are no dairy allergies/intolerances. full fat dairy is what we usually recommend until age two years. meats such as beef and poultry are usually well tolerated. the proteins to stay away from until one year of age are: fish seafood egg whites and nuts. each pediatrician tends to offer different advice as to when to introduce these "allergenic" proteins so please ask your doctor about his/her preferences.

Question: i have a small cluster of white/yellow bumbs on the base of my penis. what could this be. i have as mall area at the base of my penis where my or is and pubic area are. the bumbs came in almost clear with some type of liquid inside and now have turned a slight yellow color any ideas as to what this might be again they are not on the shaft or anywhere else just on the pubic area almost making contact with the shaft.
Baseline Response: i would like to know why they were not on my shaft. this was just the first one that came into contact with my penis and my penis was completely numb. i thought it was the other day and was wondering what was going on.

Expected Response: a description no matter how specific is not sufficient to make a "blind diagnosis" of this skin condition. as much as i would like to help you you will need to physically see a medical professional so you can be properly examined/diagnosed and perhaps have this skin condition lab-tested. there are many things that can cause the bumps you are trying to describe and it would not be prudent to just guess based solely on the information in your posting.

Question: can prednisone exacerbate cold symptoms? . original cold and cough. taking prednisone for 5 days for back pain/? herniated disc. cough and stuffiness increased greatly after starting prednisone.
Baseline Response: no.
Cough is caused by a strong cold, such as cold or flu. The symptoms of cold are usually mild, and you should avoid using or taking the medicine.
What is prednisolone?
Prednisolones are a drug that is used to treat cold. The drug is used for cough, cold, and colds.
How does prednisodone work?
The drug works by increasing the amount of prednisole (prescription) to the body and relieving symptoms. This works by causing a person to cough or cold.
Where do prednisos and prednisolloids come from?
When prednisoles and prediploids are combined, the drug causes the body to cough and cough up

Expected Response: steroids have lowered my immune system and i have caught colds in the past while taking them. also i rarely get sick at all. my answer to you would be yes.

Question: i have a stubborn keloid since giving birth to 2 daughters via cesarean 20 yrs ago. still growing & causing inflammation
Baseline Response: my daughter is just as sick as me but I am willing to take her to hospital.
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear this. many people think a keloid is just a large unattractive scar. they don't realize the pain a keloid can cause. i'd suggest you consult a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. he or she will be able to assess your keloid and provide you with various treatment options from cortisone injections to surgery. of course surgical removal of a keloid can lead to. another keloid. however i've seen good results from the surgical removal of keloids too. at any rate a plastic and reconstructive surgeon will be able to give you all of your options up to an including surgery. you certainly can opt for less aggressive treatment first to see if it will work. i wish you all the best!

Question: what type of exercises are ok after knee and hip replacement?
Baseline Response: you should always do knee and hips exercises.
If you are not sure what type you are looking for, then you should ask your doctor or nurse for a consultation.
What are the best knee and hamstring exercises for the knee?
If the knee is not performing well, then a knee or hamstring exercise should be done.
When is a knee and ham exercise good for you?
A knee and leg exercise can be done when you are feeling the best you can and after your knee or ham exercises have been performed.
How is a ham exercise better than a knee exercise?
Ham exercises can be used to help you get better at your knee, but they can also be used for other reasons, such as to reduce your risk of osteoporosis and to help prevent your risk factors for osteoporoscular disease.
The best ham exercises for your knee and knee are:
You can

Expected Response: we tend to advise our patients to avoid high impact activities following hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. so we do not want people running or jumping if it can be avoided. there really is no consensus opinion about activities following hip and knee replacement. different surgeons will allow different amounts of activity. if a patient of mine wants to do some weight training i tend to advise them to avoid really heavy weights and focus more on "reps". i also tend to tell my patients to try to maintain exercise as they can because i certainly feel that the benefit gained from the exercise likely outweighs the wear seen by the implant. it is certain that you will have less wear if you do not exercise at at all but that will likely come at the expense of your overall health.

Question: what are early warning signs of type-2 diabeties if you are not obese? . i've taking general blood tests but have not been diagnosed with diabetes. i'm wondering if there's any definite signs/symptoms that would show that i'm at risk i'm female 22 yrs old white weight 135 at 5'7". my grandmother has type 2 diabetes.
Baseline Response: i'm a diabetic and i'm not sure if i'm still at risk of type 2 diabetism or not.

Expected Response: this is a great question. here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes from the american diabetes association: age over 45 people with family history of diabetes being overweight or obese people who don't exercise regularly people with high blood pressure low hdl (good) cholesterol or high triglyceride level certain racial/ethnic groups (blacks hispanic/latino americans asian americans and pacific islanders american indians alaska natives) women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy or have had a baby born weighing 9 or more pounds people whose fasting glucose (blood sugar) or glucose tolerance tests are impaired- indicating increased risk of developing diabetes <link> you mentioned that one of you family members - your grandmother has type 2 diabetes. there are steps that you can take to help reduce your risk including keeping at a healthy weight eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. it would also be helpful to ask your health care provider how often you should check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels to make sure they are at good levels. take care
================================================================================
Question: if i decline coverage through my employer because i am covered under my wife's plan do i have to pay a penalty?
Baseline Response: yes, you have to agree to pay the penalty. However, if your plan is not covered under your plan, you will still have to provide your wife with the coverage that she needs.
In my case, my wife needed to pay $9,000 in monthly premiums and the premium for my coverage was $2,900.
My husband and I are currently covered under our plan. We pay $10,000 a month in premiums and he has to pay up to $4,500 in monthly coverage for his coverage.
I don't have to worry about the penalty, but if my husband is covered under his plan, he will need to pay additional premiums to cover the cost of his coverage and the cost to my wife of the additional coverage. If he is not, then we will be stuck with $10k per month.

Expected Response: no. what matters is that you have qualified health insurance coverage. you can get that in a number of ways -- through an employer (whether it's yours or your spouse's) by buying it coverage on your own through medicare medicaid the va etc. as long as you have health insurance you will not be assessed a penalty.

Question: had surgery a year ago can not work or stand or move with out pain in stomacke since no medication is working what is it. after 2nd surgery in january 2012 ( adhesion removal) the pain in my stomache is so bad that i can not stand long enough to even do dishes or cook if anything touches my stomache at all the pain is so bad i want to just cry and not stop i can not lay down or sit up on my own can not walk through a store have to get on of those electric wheel chairs the doctors have tried so many treatments from pain pills to ontiment to anti depressants. this has changed my life completely
Baseline Response: If I can't stand to sit down I am going to go to the doctor and have surgery.
Answer 2:
I am going in to have surgery and my doctor has told me I have no pain. The pain is not that bad it is just that I cannot stand it

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. have any of your medical providers done an x-ray of your abdomen? if not i suggest you contact your primary health care provider and request one. tell him or her you just want to make sure you're not walking around with a retained instrument or sponge. an x-ray is a cheap fast way to make sure the surgeons left nothing behind by accident. if you've already had an x-ray to confirm there are no foreign bodies in your abdomen then i'd suggest you consult a different doctor for a second opinion on what could be causing this pain. it seems like pain this severe should be attributable to some cause. i'd suggest you press your health care providers to find a cause for this pain. wishing you all the best!

Question: can condoms cause the vaginal area to become red and swollen? . i just had sex for the first time with a condom. afterwards my lower vagina where the penis enters is now red and swollen. i have trouble going to the bathroom because it hurts so bad. i want to know what i can do to fix it without going to the doctor. but if i have to go i understand. tell me what is wrong and what i should do?
Baseline Response: you can't tell someone what to do.
Solution: ask them what they need to do to get the problem under control.
How to cure it:
I do this by taking a blood test. The test results are usually very good and usually the patient is able to tell you what to take. If it's a blood draw and they don't have a blood source for the test, they can do a blood transfusion or vaginal ring test. You can also use a vaginal ring to help with the problem.

Expected Response: the condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sex. especially for the first time. the redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen (assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time) burning on urination could be "cystitis" irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee (used to be called "honeymoon cystitis" back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex) or even a urinary tract infection. sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area -- and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection. germs can come from fingers mouths (oral sex) as well as a penis. now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adult-like decisions when it comes to your medical care. if you do have a urinary tract infection (burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe) this needs to be medically evaluated. a urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information. a pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosis. only a simple urine test. my suggestion would be for you to get checked. just in case. women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not. obviously infections are more common if you do have sex. i am pleased that you and your partner used a condom. make sure you use them 100% of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems.

Question: will gonorrhea go away without treatment? how long does it last? . my partner tested positive for gonorrhea and chlamydia about a month ago. i am negative. he claims he contracted it from an affair 6 years ago and was never treated. is this possible?
Baseline Response: this is not possible. gonorrheal disease does not occur in a person without a history of gonorrhemia. It is more likely to occur in people with a history. The only way to know is if the person has had sex with a man or woman before.

Expected Response: gonorrhea is less like to go away without treatment. it is better to visit venereal disease expert and get treated. if left untreated recurrence of symptoms is very common.
================================================================================
Question: can i continue my flat abs workout when planning for pregnancy? what kind of exercises i shld avoid? . i had an ectopic pregnancy on june 2011.
Baseline Response: my first attempt at a long-term pregnancy was a few weeks after my first vaginal operation, and my vaginal infection was almost completely gone. After that, i tried two different methods to prevent pregnancy: a vaginal mesh (a latex condom) and a vaginal sponge (a cotton ball). The results were good. The vaginal mesh was less likely to cause infection, and the sponge less likely.

Expected Response: you aren't supposed to do any floor abs lying on your back after your first trimester. there is a great quiz on here about exercising & pregnancy you can take that is very informative & also touches on that question <positive_smiley>

Question: would it be possible to get a allergy test to see what my daughter is allergic too without knowing what it is. doctor keeps telling me she needs to know what my daughter is having a reaction to first but i would much prefer if she could have test done to see what my daughter is allergic too. is there a test out there that can do that without knowing what the allergy is?
Baseline Response: The first test I have done is called a "PTSD" and i think it is called the "Toxoplasmosis" test. I also have a test called the ATSD, and i have a few other tests in my lab that can help. i have also tried using a test for my daughter's allergies but i am not sure if that would be able to do the same.
Answer
Answer - The second test is called "The Toxoplasma gondii" and is called both a "Toxicity Test" and a "Immune

Expected Response: hi some symptoms would really help us to help you they kept giving my son stuff till they sent him off for a skin test now that was in the uk. so have just no idea how it works in the us do have to do it private? if so just get one done but they will need to know what things you use that may be causing her problem. good luck

Answer 2: i was in the hospital for a week with anxiety. i was trying to figure out how to get through it and it was hard. so i went to a gym and did a couple exercises and i felt like i

Expected Response: hello jean13. it's very good that you can reach out and talk about your issues. if you are way overweight then yes exercise is always recommended. but not always necessary in 2011 i was able to lose 70 lbs in less than 5 months by doing no exercise. a life changing experience helped me to learn the secret to weight loss and how to look at life for what it is. losing weight has to do with working less not working more. depending on how overweight you are you might not want to put too much pressure on a body that's already struggling with an amount of weight that's too much for your frame. losing weight is 100% mental. if you're mentally in it the body will follow and do its thing as long as you understand to get out of your own way. i also suffered from anxiety and depression. i beat the hell out it though. i had to take 47 pills a week. my condition got worse and worse. losing weight is about becoming aware of what you are not who you are or what others are saying or doing or what your occupation is. your body doesn't understand that stuff. trust me. i speak from experience not just reciting something i got off the internet tv or some crap story in the tabloids. i just got finished losing 15 lbs in a week and a half. no problem. i'm telling you that you're much more powerful than you think and much more powerful than you've been taught in school on tv in magazines or even in church. the greatest dietary supplements and pharmacy on the planet is already in you. it's just waiting for you to throw the switches. you are divine. know it! you are a product of nature not something that's owned by a corporation. be your own president. i'm always here if you need anything answered or just need to talk. i would like to know how much you weigh or how much you need to lose if you don't mind. keep your head up and have a glorious logical day!

Baseline Response: - i believe the only thing that is "irritating" is the feeling of being in the middle of nowhere with no control over my body.
A note on the prescribing chart

Expected Response: hi try this below its a post of mine this should really help you as it will clean you blood up plaque build up will do this to you. and this will help you kick out both drugs. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonfuls each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. don’t forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on. one last piece of info some cp i got out here in greece was not very hot so changed shops and using a 50/50 mix of cp and chilli powder this i put a heaped teaspoon on top each day along with a heaped teaspoon of turmeric now from a site i’m on they say to help turmeric get absorbed to take a ¼ teaspoon of black pepper with it what a great way to light a fire in your stomach to get the day started.

Question: when signing up for health insurance in the exchange what happens to families with mixed eligibility?
Baseline Response: the exchange will not offer coverage for those with a high risk of being uninsured.
If you're a child and you have a pre-existing condition, you'll be able to sign up for insurance through the exchange. If you have preexisting conditions, you can't sign up.
How to sign Up for Health Insurance in the Exchange
1. Make sure you have your name, address, and phone number.
2. Make your pre-paid plan available through the exchanges.
3. Have a health plan available on the exchanges as well.
4. Include a policy with a policy number. If a policy does not exist, you may not be able or willing to buy a health insurance policy in the marketplace.
5. Get a policy from an insurance company that is authorized to do business with you.
6. Keep track of the number of people you

Expected Response: one of the most important aspects of the state insurance exchange is that there is “no wrong door” to find appropriate coverage. when you apply your application will determine your family’s eligibility for medicaid chip and exchange subsidies. states determine eligibility for medicaid based on household income. if you qualify for medicaid in your state you cannot qualify for a subsidy on the exchange. subsidy eligibility on the health insurance exchanges depends upon your household income and its relation to the federal poverty level (fpl). if your household earns between 100-400 percent of the fpl that corresponds to the size of your family you are eligible for subsidies on the exchange. for a single person in 2013 the 100-400 percent fpl income range is $11 490 to $45 960. in some cases for example children may qualify for chip whereas the parents qualify for exchange subsidies. in all cases your state health insurance exchange should lead you to the “right door” for coverage.

Expected Response: what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about 2 capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you

No, but i'm very worried about my husband. he needs to stop giving me the blowjob every time i tell him to stop. he is so stressed out he

Question: how can i build white blood cells with food?
Baseline Response: The answer is simple: don't eat foods with white blood. You should have a healthy diet, but you should have plenty of carbohydrates and protein to make it work.
If you are trying to get your blood glucose to be below your goal, you will be more likely to get a heart attack.
It is also worth noting that if you are eating too much fat, you can get a high blood sugar.
White blood cells are important to the body, but they are not a necessary part of your body.
What is the most important thing to know about white blood cell research?
White cell research is often based on a small amount of research done by scientists.
For example, in the past, researchers have used white blood stem cells to treat a small number of patients with heart failure.
However, the evidence is still lacking.
There is a lot of evidence that white blood is a very

Expected Response: simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.

Question: is it ok to take a probiotic with antibiotics such as amoxicillan?
Baseline Response: I think you should take a bacterial probiotic. It's a very safe and effective probiotic and it's also quite safe. It does not affect your immune system.
Do you have any questions about the following probiotics?
My answer to that question is no. I have not taken any probiotics that are known to cause illness.
I think the most common probiotic is the vitamin C. I haven't had any ill effects from it. It doesn't affect my immune system, it doesn't cause any problems, it does not cause any side effects.
What's the most important thing you should know about the antibiotic?
I have never been sick with a bacterial infection. The bacteria are harmless.
But there are other antibiotics that you can take. If you're not taking them, you should not take them.
You should never take antibiotics with other drugs

Expected Response: yes. that would be fine.

Question: my hgba1c is 9. 1 fbs is 92. is this indicative of diabetes? . my vit d was also low so my doctor has prescribed me something for that. i'm not sure if the vit d can alter the hgba1c. i have all the symptoms of diabetes and a strong family history. i also have an autoimmune disorder (not sure if it's ra or lupus yet).
Baseline Response: my vit is 9, but my doctor says that my hsgba1a is 5.
Answer 2: My hgca1c has been prescribed for diabetes. my doctor said that my vit does not change the hsgca1a. he has said that the vit doesn't change the insulin. the hgs is like a different color, i think.

Expected Response: yes
================================================================================
Question: is it true that you shouldn't take medicines with milk?
Baseline Response: Yes, they are safe. If you take a milk powder, you can't take a medicine.
It's true that the food that you eat will have more vitamins and minerals. But if you take vitamins and supplements, then you'll be able to get better health and get better quality of life.
If you want to get a better quality diet, then take a good diet.
The way that you get better will depend on your health. You can't get better with a bad diet. You're not going to get stronger with a good one.
You're not really going to have a better diet because you're going to be eating a lot more foods. So if you want a better health, then a good health diet is what you need.
I think that's why people need to take the time to understand the difference between food and vitamins and the difference in health between a good and

Expected Response: most medications work best if taken with water. there are certain foods that can affect the absorption of medication. it is important to ask your pharmacist about taking medication with or without food with every new prescription you begin.

Question: is it safe to take hydroco 5/325 and. 5mg xanax? . i was in an auto accident and broke my ankle/foot wrist and had internal abdomonal injuries and was prescribed hydroco 5/325 for pain. i also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and have been taking. 5 mg of alprazolam per day. are these two medications safe to take at the same time? i take 1 hydroco 5/325 tablet every 4-6 hours for pain and take. 5mg alprazolam per day.
Baseline Response: Answer 1:
What is the difference between hydroco and hydrochloride?
A hydroco tablet is a tablet containing hydrocarbons that have been injected into the blood of the body. A hydrocarbon is a substance that is broken down by the body and is known as a hydrocarbon. A water molecule is a molecule that is composed of a certain number of molecules. Hydrocarbons

Expected Response: i'm glad you asked because many others will benefit. you should be just fine taking this combination of medications. you may feel drowsier than normal. and anyone who is taking a narcotic (hydrocodone) should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions. in general though you're not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages. in the future i'd recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time you're prescribed a narcotic. also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice. i hope your ankle heals quickly! it is definitely safe. you want to be careful to see how they interact with each other at a time when you can lay down if necessary. i take four 1 mg xanax a day and two 7. 5/325 mg of norco (hydrocodone) everyday. make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications.

Question: is tightness in the uterus and vaginal discharge a possible pregnancy symptom five days after sex? i'm on the pill. 5 days ago i had sex with my bf for the first time and 3 days ago we had sex again. i'm on the pill and take it at the same time every day but we didn't use a condom. i have a weird feeling in my uterus. a tingling/pulling feeling and like something is there. i've been pregnant before and i remember this same feeling (although not this early on or maybe this time i'm more aware). could i be pregnant? are there any other explanations for what this tight feeling in my uterus may be?
Baseline Response: you can't. If your cervix is too tight, it will start to swell and you won't get a full-blown pregnancy. You'll probably get pregnant when your cervid gets too thin.
Answer #2: I have had a couple of different types of pregnancy

Expected Response: congratulation your prego

Question: i had unprotected sex and after 2 days my virgina started itchying its now a week and it itches only at nyt shud i worry
Baseline Response: It's not a virus. I have a virus that infects my prostate, but it doesn't cause any symptoms.
Answer 2: I'm not sure if you can tell me that.
Solution: I don't think I have it. I didn't have any pimples when I got the virus.

Expected Response: you should always be concerned when you have unprotected sex. the risk of an std is not worth the worry so why not just use condoms and protect yourself? your symptoms could indicate a yeast infection since itching is a primary symptom but there is really no way of knowing if you have contracted other stds unless you were properly examined and tested. it is sooooo much easier to use condoms.
================================================================================
Question: what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for genital herpes?
Baseline Response: the exam and tests can help doctors evaluate or diagnose genital herpes. In addition, the tests help you to decide whether you have genital herpes, whether you should get a second opinion, whether or not to get a test, and if you should have any more tests.
What are the best exams and test providers?
The best exams are usually the ones that help you decide whether to get genital herpes or not.
Which test providers are in your area?
There are many different testing providers in your city. If you are not familiar with what the testing provider is, you can check out the online list of testing providers on the web.
The American Association of Test Practitioners (AAPT) has a list of test providers that you can look up and find out more about.
Are there any other tests that help people with genital herpes to diagnose or test for genital HSV?

Expected Response: genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on your medical history and a physical exam. your doctor may ask you the following questions: do you think you were exposed to genital herpes or another sexually transmitted disease ( std )? how do you know? did your partner tell you? what are your symptoms? do you have sores in the genital area or anywhere else on your body? do they usually come and go? do you have any urinary symptoms including frequent urination burning or stinging with urination or urinating in small amounts? if you have discharge from the vagina or penis it is important to note any smell or color. what method of birth control do you use? did you use condoms to protect against stds? which high-risk sexual behaviors do you or your partner engage in? have you had an std in the past? how was it treated? after the medical history is taken: a woman will have a gynecological exam. a pap test is not specific for genital herpes but may be included depending on the woman's medical history. a man will have a genital exam to check for hsv infection. your doctor may be able to diagnose genital herpes from your medical history and physical exam especially if the herpes sores are typical in appearance. but if this is your first outbreak of suspected genital herpes further testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis. herpes tests cannot always show if you have a primary genital herpes outbreak or you have been infected in the past. sometimes a test result can be negative even though the person has herpes. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Baseline Response: Answer #1: the doctor is not sure, but if he feels ill then he can call your doctor.
Answer 2: your doctor will be very helpful, but you may not know where to get your malaria medication.

Expected Response: call a doctor immediately if you have been in an area where malaria is present were exposed to mosquitoes and develop flu -like symptoms (such as fever chills headache and nausea ). watchful waiting watchful waiting is a wait-and-see approach. if you get better on your own you won't need treatment. if you get worse you and your doctor will decide what to do next. do not wait to call a doctor if you think you have malaria. call a doctor immediately. for people who live for many years in countries where malaria is common and have some immunity to malaria watchful waiting is okay for mild malaria symptoms. flu-like symptoms may also be caused by many other diseases or health conditions. watchful waiting is not appropriate for most travelers. if you have a question about your symptoms call your doctor. who to see health professionals who can check out symptoms that may be caused by malaria include: physician assistants or nurse practitioners. family medicine physicians. pediatricians. internists. infectious disease specialists. in the united states call the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) toll-free at 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-cdc-info) or visit the cdc's malaria web site (wwwn. cdc. gov/travel/yellowbookch4-malaria. aspx) to receive the most current information about malaria and appropriate travel precautions. your doctor or local health department may also have this information. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: how do doctors determine where a pulmonary embolism came from? . my sister died during a pregnancy from a pulmonary embolism. the autopsy determined the clot came from the femoral vein. . i am in human body and disease class and the topic that i picked from the hat was "pulmonary embolism. i am going to use part of my sister's autopsy in my research paper. that is why i need to know how the medical examiner was able to make the determination of where the embolism came from. . thank you for your help. . radar
Baseline Response: what is the proper way to determine where the pulmonary embolic is? the proper method to determine is a normal heart beat and blood flow, but not a heart beat. . The heart rate and blood pressure are monitored, and it is determined to be a normal heartbeat. . the heart rate is monitored, but blood flow is not monitored.
Answer
Answer : what is a standard blood

Expected Response: i am so very sorry to hear about the loss of your sister and her baby. my condolences to you and your entire family. i admire your willingness to write a paper on the very topic that took your sister's life. i think that takes a lot of strength and courage. to answer your question. a pulmonary embolism is caused when all or part of a blood clot breaks loose in a vein travels to the lungs and blocks a major artery there. usually a small part of a much larger clot (or " thrombus ") breaks off and causes the embolism. we know these large clots usually occur in leg veins so the medical examiner probably opened up the femoral vein and saw the remaining portion of the large clot still residing within the vein. that is how he or she knew where the clot came from. in a living person it can sometimes be impossible to determine where an embolism-causing clot came from. many people with blood clots in their legs have no symptoms. i hope you find this answer useful. good luck with your paper!

Question: mole getting removed near penis how long does it take to be normal? . i will have a little operation to get removed a mole on my penis they will use dissolvable stitches. how long does it take for me to have sex after surgery? i have a date in a week after the surgery. will it take more than a week.? thank you.
Baseline Response: mole is a very rare and highly invasive surgery. It is an invasive surgery that involves removing a mole from your penis that is almost completely removed. It takes approximately 24 hours to remove. This means that you need to be in an induced coma for about 10 minutes before you can start your sex life.

Expected Response: i would advise you to ask the doctor. honestly you have a completely valid question there and the doctor not only will give you advice specific to your situation but may change the method of wound closure to accommodate your needs if he knows this in advance. there's no way to estimate whether or not it will be safe for you to have sex a week after your surgery because many different factors come into play: the exact location of the mole the size of the incision condom usage etc. please don't feel shy about asking your doctor about this. trust me he will take your question seriously. wishing you well!

Question: can a penile fungal infection remain in underwear and cause constant reinfection? . have been dealing with some sort of irritation for months on the tip of my penis that i can not find the cause for. have tried antibiotics antifungals and almost everything else (have seen many doctors). one doctor suggested i buy all new underwear as well as use an antifungal as it may be fungal but i keep getting reinfected from my tainted underwear. is this possible?
Baseline Response: yes. it is possible. the infection may be present in the underwear. the doctor may try to remove the infected part of the underwear but the infection is still there. the problem is that the infection can spread to other parts of the body. the way the infection spreads is through the penis itself. the most common method of infection is genital herpes. There are many other ways of infection. it depends on the severity of the infection. you can get a small amount of the bacteria

Expected Response: i would not agree that properly washed underwear would likely retain any fungus residuals. fungus can exist just about everywhere in the home - especially in warm dark or moist areas. finding the one source or sources may be difficult. have you seen a dermatologist? if not this would be recommended. have you tried using man1 man oil? it contains several antibacterial vitamins and nutrients that help with infection and other skin issues down there. simply rub it into your penis skin and let it do the work. it's all natural too so no side effects. you can get it online. hope this helps.

Question: 62 yrs. old. having tenderness around my nipple when clothes rub against it; some pain in whole breast. not pregnant. post-menopausal so no periods or pregnancy. it this something to be concerned about? been going on for about 2 months. only happening in one breast.
Baseline Response: No, it was a very good thing. the most important thing was that we had a baby. I don't know if it was the first time, but it was very interesting. We were very happy and I think I've been pretty happy ever since.
I was going to tell you about my experience with the nappy on my first baby. It was really a relief. It didn't really matter to me that I was going through a period of pain and then I had a good time. I mean, it's not like I had anything to worry about. It wasn't like I was in a panic. I was just in a state of worry.
If

Expected Response: in all probability what you're experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer. that said the full answer is a bit more complicated. the fact you're having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag. i'd suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated. obviously you don't want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin. even if you've had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated. with luck it will turn out to be something simple but you'll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this. good luck to you!

Question: who is at risk for prostate cancer?
Baseline Response: Most of the people at risk of prostate cancer are men who have been in the U.S. for a long time. The U.K. and the U of T are among the most conservative countries in the world, but there are other countries like China and Japan, where the incidence of prostatectomy has been increasing. Most of the men who are at risk are men from the U/S. and those from other countries.
The most common cause of prostate-related death in men from other nations is prostate cancer, which is caused by a combination of factors such as age, gender, and family history of prostateitis.

Source 2: National Center for Health Statistics, United States
Source 3: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United Kingdom
Source 4: National Institutes of Health, United State
Source 5: National Institute of Health Statistics
Source 6: National Vital Statistics

Expected Response: an important risk factor is age; more than 70 percent of men diagnosed with this disease are over the age of 65. african american men have a substantially higher risk of prostate cancer than white men including hispanic men. dramatic differences in the incidence of prostate cancer are also seen in different populations around the world. there is some evidence that dietary factors are involved such as vitamin e and selenium which may have a protective effect. genetic factors also appear to play a role particularly for families in which the diagnosis is made in men under age 60. the risk of prostate cancer rises with the number of close relatives who have the disease.

Question: i was diagnosed with acute pharyngitis and came home haven't been able to eat barely drink feel ill. is this normal? . i was perscribed motrin 600 mg and zithromax for it and i took some of each at the emergency room. pretty much immediately started feeling nauseous wanted to throw up went back and she told me that i needed to eat food with it. went home and had a little food but later vomited anyway. had diarrea chest pains stomache pains woke up twice with extreme waves of anxiety the second time i threw up. i haven't been able to keep food down and am trying desperately to keep water down. is this ok?
Baseline Response: no it is not ok. i am not a medical student and i have not been able come to an agreement on how to get to the emergency rooms. i can't even get to them.
Answer 2: i got into the emergency department at the beginning of my semester

Expected Response: it is normal to feel sick for a day or two when you have acute pharyngitis. the nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick. try to eat something if you can -- anything. but if you can't keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know. you don't want to become dehydrated. also if you're not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call. several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so that's something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on.

Question: what are viral hemorrhagic fevers?
Baseline Response: virus hemorrhagic fever.
Answer 1: What are viral viral hemorrhages?

Expected Response: viral hemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. in general the term "viral hemorrhagic fever" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). characteristically the overall vascular system is damaged and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. these symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. while some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses many of these viruses cause severe life-threatening disease.

Baseline Response: Yes. There is no question about the risk of colon cancer. If you have a colon cancer, it is very difficult to get help. We recommend that you start with a colonoscope. If your colon is colon cancer-free, there is no need to worry about your colonoscopies.
This is the only way to tell whether you have cancer.
If you have colon cancer and it is non-cancerous, your doctor will tell you to go to the doctor. This is a long-term approach and it will be done by your doctor or by your pharmacist.
We have a lot of information about the cancer. We have information about cancer in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France, Spain, Spain and Italy.
What should you do if you

Expected Response: the biggest thing. is that the pathology is non-malignant. the main questions to ask your physician if you have not already would be whether he feels as though he got it all. additionally it might be worth asking if there was any dysplasia in the specimen. (dysplasia just means that the cells look "funny" like they are changing in some way. ) asking these questions might allow you to have a bit more of a discussion with your physician so that you could feel better about the plan. .

Question: can battery acid from a vibrator burn my genitals. i thought i had a vaginal yeast infection but it turns out my vibrator was leaking battery acid and has burned my vaginal area included and up to my rectum. what can i do to ease my pain?
Baseline Response: A vibrator has a built-in battery that is able to charge and charge itself. The battery can be used to charge the vibrator and it will charge itself, even if the vibrating device is not plugged in. The vibrator will charge even if your vibrating devices are not plugged into the vibrators.
You can use a vibrating pad or a vibrators toothbrush to charge your vibrator. You can also use a battery as a lubricant.
For more information, see the article on Battery Life.
Why do I need to use a charger?
You may not need to recharge your battery. Most people only need to charge their vibrator once.
If you

Expected Response: the batteries in a vibrator are "dry cells" so it does not have any acid like a car battery. without an examination a clinician cannot be sure but i suspect that your vaginal infection/irritation is more likely to be the cause. see your gynecologist so that you can be properly examined and treated and i am confident that this issue can be solved.

Question: how is paget's disease diagnosed?
Baseline Response: it's a pretty good question. It's pretty hard to diagnose. There are a few things that you need to look at, but if you look at the data that we have for paget, it's not very well understood. And what we do have is a pretty basic definition of what is called a "cancer." It's a kind of disease that's caused by a tumor. It can be a tumor of any kind. And if you're sick, you get sick. If you're not sick, and you're a patient, you can get cancer.
And it's very hard to tell what type of cancer is the cancer, because it's so different from what we know about cancer. And it's really hard to figure out.
It's a little bit harder to tell the exact cause of it. You have to go back and look at what we've seen. But you can certainly tell it's an

Expected Response: paget's disease is diagnosed based on the x-ray appearance. paget's disease might also be detected with other imaging tests such as a bone scan mri scan and ct scan. alkaline phosphatase an enzyme that comes from bone is frequently elevated in the blood of people with paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. this blood test is also referred to as the serum alkaline phosphatase (sap) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of paget's disease. the bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. bone that is affected by paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images.

Question: what does it mean when temp is below normal. have been ill with flu like symptoms but temp has gone down to 97. 8
Baseline Response: the average temperature of the world is above 97. 9
Answer. coldest place on earth, is a place called Antarctica, where temperatures have gone down about 6 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) or below. the average temp is above 95. 10
Answer is a cold place on the earth, it is a little cooler than the average place on Earth, but still warmer than average. 11
Answer coldest location on earth is in Antarctica. cold place is from Antarctica, it has a slightly cooler atmosphere. coldplace is from a place that has a higher temperature, it can be cooler than average, but the atmosphere is cold and there is a lot of wind blowing. coldspot is the place that is most cold, there is no wind blowing there. cold spot is a spot of the coldest part of the earth. cold

Expected Response: that temperature is just a variation of normal. less than a degree below the average. this is not medically-significant.

Question: a recent testicular ultrasound showed i have restricted blood flow to both testes but no torsion. what could it be? . i have had chronic epididimitis for 9 years and am finally going for an epididimectomy. that was the reason for the ultrasound. my urologist is not sure about the restricted blood flow but doesn't think it is something to worry about.
Baseline Response: i was told by my urology specialist that i had a normal epididymal function. i was given a small dose of ibuprofen and i am now taking ibupropion.
I am a fairly good doctor and i do not take any drugs. I am not going to go through this again. I will try to get a CT scan done and do an ultrasound.
The doctor said that if i had to have a CT ultrasound it would be a good idea to get an epididymitic test.

Expected Response: hi have look at this link it just may shine a light on your problem. the link <link> good luck
================================================================================
Question: how long does it take to develop a resistance to an antibiotic?
Baseline Response: it depends on the drug.
An antibiotic is a drug that has been approved for use in an individual and is used for a specific purpose. It is an antibiotic that has not been approved by the FDA for use for a particular purpose. For example, a drug has been used for an antibiotic for a short period of time, and the drug is not approved for that purpose. In this case, the drug has not shown effectiveness.
The best way to develop resistance is to use a variety of drugs that are safe to use and are not causing any side effects. For instance, if you have a history of high blood pressure, and you have been taking antibiotics for a long time, you might be able to develop resistant bacteria, but that would not have been possible if the drug were used to treat your high blood pressures.
In addition, there are medications that are approved for certain diseases, such as

Expected Response: it depends on how much is being used and how often bacteria are exposed to the drug. it's related to the volume of use and the ability of bacteria to change their coat of armor. it can happen in months; it can happen in weeks or even over a period of years. it usually takes longer for resistance to become widespread but with an increase in travel we can transport bacteria within hours to another location.

Question: what can i do to releive the sciatic pain i have especially first thing in the morning? . i have had sciatic pain that radiates from my back into my butt down my leg and into my ankle for over a year now. i am currently taking naproxen 500mg twice daily and 1500mg tylenol if needed during the night. i find that sitting walking and especially lying down seem to make the pain worse. i have morning when i get out of bed that the pain is intense enough that i am unable to stand. is there some type of exercise or something i can do to help? . thanks for any information you can give me.
Baseline Response: i have been taking tylenolic acid for a year. i feel as if i am on a roller coaster. i think this is due to the fact that i dont get enough tylen on my diet and i feel like i have lost a lot of weight. i also noticed that i have a lot

Expected Response: back exercises and stretching is the best non-surgical way of dealing with sciatica. if you are overweight the extra lbs. need to go. you can find lots of internet references for the proper exercises (called williams back exercises) or ask a friendly physical therapist for a list.
================================================================================
Question: how long do dental crowns last?
Baseline Response: Answer :
Answer 1 :
As you can see, there is no longer any difference in the length of the crowns. The crowns are only slightly longer and therefore the length is different.
Answer 2 :
In my opinion, the crown has been replaced by the standard crowns of a dental dental dentist.

Expected Response: on average dental crowns last between 5 and 15 years. the life span of a crown depends on the amount of "wear and tear" the crown is exposed to how well you follow good oral hygiene practices and your personal mouth-related habits (you should avoid such habits as grinding or clenching your teeth chewing ice biting your fingernails and using your teeth to open packaging).
================================================================================
Question: how is the common cold spread?
Baseline Response: It is spreading through the population.
Source: CDC
The number of cases of the common flu is high. It is a very large infection. The virus is spread through contact with the body and can cause serious illness. It can be very difficult to identify the source of the virus. In the United States, there are over 1 million flu cases. The number of people infected with the common virus is estimated to be around 2 million. The CDC estimates that there are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people infected.
The common cold virus is not contagious. The common cold is spread by contact with other people. The person who receives the cold is not the person who is infected with it.
In the United Kingdom, the common influenza virus is known as Influenza A. This virus causes severe illness and death. It also causes pneumonia. Influenza is not a contagious disease. It does not cause pneumonia.
Symptoms

Expected Response: the common cold is spread either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after individuals sneeze or cough. person-to-person transmission often occurs when an individual who has a cold blows or touches their nose and then touches someone or something else. a healthy individual who then makes direct contact with these secretions can subsequently become infected often after their contaminated hands make contact with their own eyes or nose. a cold virus can live on objects such as pens books telephones computer keyboards and coffee cups for several hours and can thus be acquired from contact with these objects.

Question: can an ovarian cyst grow back? . two years ago i had a 10cm cyst along with my right ovary removed using robotic surgery. i have started to develop the same exact symptoms on my right side that i had two years ago. dull pain in my lower back sometimes a sharp pain just above my groin area. the pain seems to be worse when i wake in the morning. there have been a couple of times that i could hardly lift myself from the bed. then the pain goes away after walking around. . . thanks!
Baseline Response: no.
Answer : no. a cyst in the abdomen is just a kind of a small, irregular lump with a little blood, a little red blood cells and a little swelling around it.

Expected Response: ovarian cysts tend to form at the time of ovulation and yes new cysts can form as long as you are still ovulating. i would suggest that you see your gynecologist consider an ultrasound. since there can be many other causes to account for your pain this would be a good place to start.
================================================================================
Question: what medication helps to sleep? . i have bipolar schizophrenia and ptsd i have trouble sleeping i'm tired of these anti psychotic meds making me gain weight what are some good medications that will make me relax and fall asleep quickly?
Baseline Response: the answer to this question depends on how much you are getting and how much it costs.

Expected Response: seroquel and lamictal are both used for schizophrenia and bipolar and have a smaller weight gain potential than many of the other atypical antipsychotics. over the counter melatonin or benadryl can sometimes help a person fall asleep. if that does not work for you hypnotic sedatives like ambien and lunesta can be effective. however these are short-term alternatives and eventually you will have to resolve whatever is causing you to not sleep. good luck!
================================================================================
Question: my father is having a heart problem and hes over weight. which exercises would you suggest for him to lose weight?
Baseline Response: my dad is a huge fan of exercise and that is why he is doing the exercise he is training.
I have found that exercise is not really an option for him.
My dad has an issue with his heart. he has a heart attack in his chest, which is causing him to have a heart bypass surgery. he is currently on a cardiac bypass, and it is not working for him at all.
His doctor says that he is suffering from an irregular heartbeat and that it is a sign of a heart disease.
He is also suffering from a high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
In the end, his doctors suggest that he could lose weight and that he should lose at least 6lbs a week.
What is your advice for parents with heart problems?
I would ask for your advice on weight loss and exercise.

Expected Response: hi i would start by getting him out doing some brisk walking walking is a good way to exercise its good for many parts of the body and gets thinks working better as he loses weight he could take a back pack with say 10 lbs at first it will help his heart pump better. he also needs to cut out any fast or junk foods these have high salts and sugars drink lots of water lots of fruit are good as part of the 5 a day with veg. its a bit hard not knowing his age but if he can swim that's very good as well its an all over exercise but he needs to be in at least twice a week or more if he can. a good diet will help as well. good luck
================================================================================
Question: i have type 2 diabetes. is it safe for me to start a low-carb diet?
Baseline Response: it is safe for you to start the low-fat diet as long as you follow the guidelines outlined in the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
There are no guidelines for any type of diet. The guidelines are based on the recommendation of the American Dietetic Association. If you are unsure about the guidelines, consult your doctor.
In fact, the guidelines are called the American Diabetes Association Guidelines for a number of different reasons. Some of the reasons for the guidelines include:
1. The American Diabetes Society recommends that people with type 2 Diabetes start their low- fat diet with at least 1 serving of carbohydrates.
2. The US Department of Agriculture recommends that you consume at least 2 servings of fruits and vegetables.
3. The National Institutes of Health recommends that your diet should be low in fat and high in saturated fat.
4. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Expected Response: studies have shown that a low-carb diet can be safe for people with diabetes. however i really don’t like the idea of any diet that severely restricts or eliminates any particular food or food group. it’s just not sustainable and ultimately will most likely leave you discouraged or disappointed. keep in mind that carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for our bodies. so they are critical for maintaining good health. the key is choosing the right kinds of carbohydrates being good carbs with low glycemic index that are less likely to cause quick rises and falls in blood sugar. opt for whole grains brown rice whole-wheat pasta and beans. combine that with lean proteins and fruits and vegetables and you’ll do wonders for your body and your diabetes.

Question: what could cause bloody stools tares in the butt crack and a nickle sized growth along the butt crack? . the tares have been there for approx. ten years and the bloody stools started about five years ago along with the nickle size growth about three years ago.
Baseline Response: this is what happened and the nickles grew and the stools were not cleaned up.
The tares are a very big problem and they can cause the butt to crack in the first place. The stools are not clean and they are not good for your skin. If the stool is stained, it is very hard to remove and if it is in a bad place the tare will be gone.
What is the cause of the bloody stains on the butt?
The most common cause of bloody stews is a small growth along a small bump on the side of the butt where the growth was originally located. This growth can cause a small amount of growth along side the

Expected Response: you have had bloody stools for five years? and tears? and a nickle-sized growth for three years? you are either very tolerant of these symptom or very reluctant to see a medical provider about them. either way my advice is for you to be properly examined. the nature of these things cannot be blindly determined by a vague description. one possibility comes to mind (there are many) and that would be pilonidal sinus tracts. these occur in the gluteal fold (butt crack) and can last a long long time. they become infected quite often resuting in drainage and pain. the cause of your bloody stools can be related to this or it could be an entirely different problem. and any of these problems could be serious. you must see a medical provider or better yet a proctologist.
================================================================================
Question: what is postpartum depression?
Baseline Response: postpartal depression is a disorder that occurs during the first few weeks after birth. It's common in children with postpartial birth defects, but most people who have postpartual depression can have no symptoms at all, so if you have postnatal depression, it is highly likely you are experiencing postpartation depression.
Postpartal Depression is a condition that can be very difficult to treat and can be treated with medication. If you have a mental illness that can affect your ability to function normally, you may not be able to manage postpartital depression. Postpartal and postpartiparietal depression can be treatable by medication.
You should talk to your doctor about your symptoms at any time and discuss the symptoms with your doctor before attempting to treat your condition.
What is postnatal depressive disorder?
Postnatal depression is an extremely rare condition. It is characterized by a persistent, persistent, and persistent inability

Expected Response: postpartum depression is a complex mix of physical emotional and behavioral changes that occur in a mother after giving birth. it is a serious condition affecting about 10% of new mothers. symptoms range from mild to severe depression and may appear within days of delivery or gradually perhaps up to a year later. symptoms may last from a few weeks to a year.

Question: i burned my arm with steam. it didn't hurt until now witch is two days later. what else besides aloe should i be using
Baseline Response: the fire is a bit hotter than i had hoped for.
The second question is: why would you put a fire extinguisher in your pocket while you are trying to do something? I am not sure why but it is because of the way that i am using the steam.
I have a small fire extinguishing case that i carry with me whenever i go out and have fun. I use it to remove some of my stuff from the house. I have a large fire extinguishers in my closet. I just put them on the shelf and they come off easily. The only thing that is different is that they have a fire hose that they can put on the stove. I don't have to put them in my pockets because i can just pull them off my chest and just let them go.

Question: i have an ankle severe ankle sprain unable to walk on it it is red swollen and hot to the touch very painfull why?
Baseline Response: i was diagnosed with an ankle spasm in early 2015.
I have had this ankle spurt since May 2014.
i was diagnosed at 6 months of age with a severe spasm of my left ankle which was caused by my knee.
the spasm had been caused by a hard or heavy load on my ankle. i had no other choice but to wear a pair of shoes, which i did not have to wear at the time, and so the spasm occurred in my left foot.
this spasm was caused mainly by my right ankle.
all of a sudden the ankle spasms began to show up. i felt pain in my right foot. i knew that my right leg was going to be swollen. i went to the doctor and told him that i could not walk on my left leg, and he told

Expected Response: well that's a good question. have you had your ankle examined by a health care professional or are you diagnosing this as a sprain on your own? because your symptoms could be caused by a sprain for sure but also by a fracture (break) in the ankle or the leg. so i'd recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to have the ankle examined. your health care provider may want to take an x-ray to make sure nothing is broken. the symptoms you describe can be a normal part of the body's healing process. when we injure tissue the body sends a big healing response to the damaged area. various cells march into action and these can cause the tissue to temporarily become hot and swollen. the pain is caused by nerves that have been irritated or injured. with any injury like the one you're describing we recommend you elevate the injured area and apply ice packs. do not place ice packs directly against the skin; use a towel or something in between. the usual recommendation is 20 minutes of ice then 20 minutes with no ice. however i again want to caution you to get examined by a doctor to make sure you haven't broken or dislocated a bone. so sorry you're hurting! i hope you get some relief soon!

Question: how does an overdose of acetaminophen cause liver injury?
Baseline Response: it can be fatal.
Answer 1: it is not a fatal overdose.
The liver is usually destroyed when the liver is completely destroyed by acetaminoacetate.
How does an acetaminosis result from acetaminosin?
An acetaminose deficiency causes the liver to become a slow cooker, which can cause liver damage.
An overdose of an acetamine can cause an acetylation disorder, a heart attack, or a stroke.
If an overdose causes liver damage, it can cause a high blood pressure.
It can also cause a blood clotting disorder, which is a chronic condition caused by a blood vessel that is not able to pump blood.
What is the difference between an acetidine deficiency and an acetaldehyde deficiency?
The distinction is that an acetidosis of the liver results in the liver being unable to pump the blood, which in turn causes a blood

Expected Response: the answer is that liver damage from acetaminophen occurs when the glutathione pathway is overwhelmed by too much of acetaminophen's metabolite napqi. then this toxic compound accumulates in the liver and causes the damage. furthermore alcohol and certain medications such as phenobarbital phenytoin (dilantin) or carbamazepine (tegretol) (anti-seizure medications) or isoniazid (inh nydrazid laniazid) an anti-tuberculosis drug can significantly increase the damage. they do this by making the cytochrome p-450 system in the liver more active. this increased p-450 activity results in an increased formation of napqi from the acetaminophen. additionally chronic alcohol use as well as the fasting state or poor nutrition can each deplete the liver's glutathione. so alcohol both increases the toxic compound and decreases the detoxifying material. accordingly the bottom line in an acetaminophen overdose is that when the amount of napqi is too much for the available glutathione to detoxify liver damage occurs.

Question: can a mammogram detect whether a lump found in the breast of a male is fat cells or a tumor? . a male friend of mine has been advised to have a mammogram even though a biopsy already ruled out cancer in a lump he found in his breast. the doctor indicates he is not certain if it is fat cells or a tumor. can a mammogram detect this? and why would they not already know this information from having performed a biopsy?
Baseline Response: the doctor's recommendation is to have the mammogram performed by a physician who is trained to perform such a biograph.

Expected Response: hi if your friend has man boobs then yes he can have a tumor so get and help him asap. good luck

Question: can low-impact exercises help with flexibility and stress in someone with fibromyalgia?
Baseline Response: In addition to using the low-intensity training for strength, flexibility and flexibility, the low intensity training is also used to improve flexibility and improve flexibility in people with fibroid disorders.
The main focus of low-stress training in fibromyosarcoma is to help people with the condition. Low-impact training is often used to help improve the strength of the muscle fibers, especially the fibroblasts, and to improve the ability of the fibroid to move and form.
Low-impact exercise is also known as "exercise stress" or "stress reduction".
The use of the low impact exercise is an important part of the rehabilitation of fibroid injuries. It is also a way to improve strength and flexibility of the muscles of the body and help in preventing fibroid fractures.
How do I do low-quality training?
In addition to low-energy

Expected Response: low-impact aerobic exercises have been shown to improve symptoms and restore muscle strength in people with fibromyalgia. some helpful exercises include: yoga -- an ancient form of exercise that can reduce stress and relieve muscular tension or pain by improving range of motion and strength. practicing yoga for fibromyalgia when you are feeling tense or anxious may help you reduce stress and the risk of injury when you are on the job or at home. tai chi -- a series of flowing graceful movements that can give you a good workout and stretching regimen. studies show that tai chi participants also increase their sense of balance can bend easier and are better able to do household tasks. with fibromyalgia tai chi can keep your back flexible and strong. pilates -- a form of exercise that focuses on breathing and strengthening the torso muscles. with pilates an instructor will help you work on postural muscles that are essential to supporting the spine.

Question: what are bisphosphonates for osteoporosis and cancer?
Baseline Response: bisphonates are a non-toxic, non-flammable, nonrefreshing, nonreactive isotope of the amino acids bisphoxyl and bisphphosphone. They are non-nucleic acid and are not acidic. They have no molecular weight and are used for a wide range of applications. The main purpose of bisphone is to prevent the formation of tumor cells by inhibiting the growth of cancerous tissue. However, they are not effective in preventing cancer in humans. They can also be used to treat other diseases such as cancer, glioblastoma, and psoriasis.
How do you get your bisphones?
The simplest way to get your free bisphopones is by following the directions below.
1. Take a blood sample.
2. Place the sample in a clean, nonpor

Expected Response: this group of drugs is used to treat or prevent osteoporosis and to treat the bone pain caused by some types of cancer.

Question: can you feel the baby after 5 mouth pregnancy
Baseline Response: can be
I think it is very important for the baby to have an opportunity to have a baby
I can also feel the little bump in the back of the head.
I feel a little bit of my belly.
The baby is not there yet.
Now, I'm sure it is not quite the same as the picture. I'm not sure how I feel.
So, I don't feel like I'm a real mother. I feel like the baby is just waiting for me to come.
It seems like it is too late to really have any real love.
What can I say?
I know that I have been in a lot of love situations.
And I've always been a very happy girl.
But I'm so happy that I'm in this place, so happy for my new baby.
Why would I want to have that baby?
Because I'm very happy

Question: my period isnt regular can i still get pregnant?
Baseline Response: I have never had a pregnancy problem since I was 13, and I have been getting pregnant for over a year. I have also tried the pills to control my periods, but I have always had problems with my period. My period is usually going to be about 2-3 weeks. My boyfriend said to me he had a problem with my periods and he has been getting more frequent periods. I am not sure if he is right or not, but his problem is very mild. If I have to go to the doctor, I would recommend going to the pharmacy and getting a prescription.
I just read the link on the other page and it says:
You can use a condom to stop your periods. It can be done by going to a doctor and you will be given the correct amount of pills.
Now I am going to give you a little more information about the pill that you will need to take and

Expected Response: you bet so if you do not intend to get pregnant it is best for you to use a very effective form of contraception. you cannot use or depend on irregular periods as a contraceptive method. if you have been trying to become pregnant are having difficulty you need to see your women's healthcare provdier for a consultation. every women is different when it comes to their ability to concieve (or not).
================================================================================
Question: how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?
Baseline Response: doctors will know whether the woman is pregnant or not. If the woman does not have an abortion, she will be eligible for a low-risk pregnancy test.
A doctor will also look at her medical history, if she is pregnant, if the woman has an abortion and whether she is currently receiving treatment.
The test will also help to determine if a man is pregnant. A doctor will look at his or her blood test results to determine whether a woman is currently having an abortion.
When a woman becomes pregnant, doctors will have to ask her about her health and her health care. The test will give doctors a better idea of whether or not a woman will have an unwanted pregnancy.
How do you know if you have an unplanned pregnancy?
A health care provider can tell you if you are pregnant. If you are still pregnant, you can talk to your health care professional to

Expected Response: sometimes doctors can find the cause of a couple's infertility by doing a complete fertility evaluation. this process usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories. if there are no obvious problems like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation tests will be needed. for a man doctors usually begin by testing his semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. for a woman the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are several ways to do this at home or doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries. if the woman is ovulating normally more tests are needed. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography: in this test doctors use x-rays to check for physical problems of the uterus and fallopian tubes. laparoscopy: during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.

Baseline Response: The Wart Assessment Test is an interactive questionnaire that asks doctors to assess a person's health and ability to live a healthy lifestyle. It is designed to be administered by a doctor and is administered by the hospital staff.
The exam has been designed to help doctors evaluate people for diseases that are not considered to be warts.
Wart Assessment Testing
The test is administered to the doctor who performs the test, and a doctor will evaluate the individual based on the following criteria:
Inadequate health, or a lack of regular exercise or exercise, or other health conditions that are known to cause warts
Warts may not be considered to have warts if they are present in the person's body, or if they have been found to be present in a person of the same sex
Wettiness or other conditions that may cause wart
Warn

Expected Response: warts are usually diagnosed based only on their appearance. in rare cases more testing is done. if the diagnosis of a skin condition is unclear or if you are at high risk of having skin cancer your doctor may take a sample of the growth and examine it (a skin biopsy ). a biopsy is usually done if a skin growth is darker than the skin surrounding it appears as an irregular patch on the skin bleeds or is large and growing rapidly. proper diagnosis of plantar warts is important. some wart treatments can cause scarring. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Expected Response: if you are sexually involved and not using any form of birth control it is only a matter of time before you will become pregnant. a white discharge and fatigue is not a definitive sign of pregnancy. if you are worried get a pregnancy test or see your medical provider for an exam. if you don't want to be pregnant now then you certainly know how to prevent it. either don't have sex. or use an effective form of birth control.
================================================================================
Question: how can my “attitude” about my bedroom affect my sleep?
Baseline Response: it does. In my sleep, I usually stay up too late and sleep on my own. This is where your sleeping habits come in. The best way to avoid this is to practice your sleep habits with your partner. You can find out more about sleep habits by watching your partner's sleep schedule.
If your partner is getting up early, you can help him or her sleep. If your partner isn't getting up late, you might want to help him sleep.
Your partner will also like to get up early. When you're in bed, your partner will usually go to his or her bed. When he or she gets up, you'll want to make sure that you're up early to get him or she up. If he or her is not up early enough, you may want to leave him or herself up early if he or they are feeling really sleepy.
When you

Expected Response: your brain actually can train you to have specific emotional feelings surrounding a room in the house. and the bedroom you have to remember is a very private place but it’s also a safety issue so for example in cases where women have been raped or beaten they get almost phobic usually occurring in the bedroom almost phobic to the bedroom. alright i’ve worked with women in rape crisis centers before and they are afraid to go to sleep okay because of the things that happened to them during their sleep. so again can it happen? absolutely it can. can you get a bit milder case where we don’t have such extreme horrible circumstances can people argue in bed and get used to arguing in bed. you know what i tell people don’t have big emotional discussions in your bed if you can help it. don’t talk about your kids in bed don’t talk about your bills in bed. reserve the bed for sleep sex if you can and you know maybe evening watching a little tv reading things of that nature.

Question: i'm taking vicodin for pain and clindamycin for infection after a tooth extraction. can i add zantac 150 or tums?
Baseline Response: i've been taking it for 6 weeks now. i don't have any pain at all, but i'm not sure if i'm having a pain like the toothpaste was yesterday, or if i have a painful itch. im a long time ago and i'm never going to get any pain from my toothpaste. i used to have to take it for every tooth extraction, but now i've stopped taking it. i am thinking about getting a prescription, but im wondering if i can get it for my pain. if so, what can i do to help?

Expected Response: both vicodin and clindamycin have side effects like upset stomach nausea and vomiting but not heartburn. these medications currently do not have any known drug interactions with zantac 150 (ranitidine) or tums. he should be fine taking all these products together. however watch his symptoms. if symptoms worsen you may want to seek medical advice to make sure he doesn’t have another condition.

Question: for a herniated disk would accupuncture be helpfull?
Baseline Response: for herniating disk would be helpful.
The question is, if you're having trouble with your herniator, it's probably best to consult a doctor, since there are a few things that might be helpful. First, it might be important to know if you need help with your symptoms. For example, if your doctor says you have a high fever, that may be helpful for you. If you are having a low fever, it may be good to get a doctor's opinion. If your doctor doesn't give you a diagnosis, you might have to wait until after you've been treated to see if there is a better option.
Second, it is important to remember that acupuncture is not an "invisible" treatment. It is a technique which is used to improve the quality of your body and the quality and quantity of energy which it can provide. It might be good if you

Expected Response: acupuncture will not cure a herniated disk but some people feel that it can help with pain management. it is really your decision since there are few if any scientific studies that prove acupuncture is beneficial for this type of medical condition.
================================================================================
Question: i am 45 and had my right fallopian tube removed due to multiple ectopic pregnancies is it possible to get pregnant. how often will i ovulate with only one fallopian tube
Baseline Response: It depends on the amount of time that you have ovulated. For example, if you have an average of about 2 eggs per day, you can have about 6 eggs per week, but if you only have one fallot, you might have about 8 eggs per month. If you have a lot of fallot per month, you could have up to 20 eggs per year. This means that if you had a little more than 20 eggs in your fallopian tubes, you would have a very high probability of having a fallopian fallopian puncture.


The best way to determine if you are pregnant is to go to your doctor and ask for your medical history. If your doctor says you are not pregnant, you will have to wait at least 6 months before going to the doctor.

Expected Response: most helpful answer hi found you this on barycentre. com it could help or not? you ovulate from both sides if you have both ovaries. usually one side one month the other side the next but sometimes an ovary is the dominate ovary and does more then 50-50 (so you can't judge which side you'll ovulate on which is what i thought). one ovary could ovulate 8 times a year while the other only does 4 times a year. so if your good tube has the non-dominant ovary you could only get pregnant 4 times a year (or however many times it ovulates a year- from one to 12 times). the opposite tube can catch the egg but it's not likely. i only have one tube and conceived my son the first month we were trying. and from what i can read also seems that the right one is the more dominant one of the two which would not help you. you would just have to track your ovulation dates and make sure you have unprotected sex 4 days before reason its takes male sperm 3 days to get into the right place to receive your egg so 4 days means there sitting there waiting and sperm can live for up to 5 7 or 10 days depending where you read. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: how often to feed a 5 month old dry cereal
Baseline Response: The first question is "how often?"
Answer #1: Feeding the 5 month baby a dry cereal is a very good idea, especially if you have a baby.
A dry cereal should be kept in the refrigerator until the next day, after which it is ready for feeding.
If you feed a dry cereals that are already in the fridge, they will not spoil.
How long is a dry rice cereal?
A Dry Rice is a cereal that is about 6 months old.
It will be ready for eating on the second day.
There is a 2-3 day wait between the two day dry cereal feeding. This is the only time it will be done for the baby. The baby is fed a dry product in the first day. This product is called "milk" and it is about 4-5 days old. It is usually done in the morning and it will last about

Expected Response: please do not feed a 5-month old infant anything besides milk (breast or bottle) yet. the american academy of pediatricians recommends giving an infant milk only for the first six months. and when you do start your baby on cereal we're not talking regular cereal like cheerios. you need to feed your baby soft wet baby cereal. you'll find it in the baby food aisle. not only is your baby's digestive system not ready to handle "dry cereal" at five months of age but giving an infant "dry" anything can be a choking hazard. after your baby is safely taking baby cereal you can begin introducing jarred baby food. introduce just one new food at a time and keep a watch for any allergic reaction. most babies tolerate baby food just fine but if you notice signs of a rash after feeding your infant baby food you should not feed it again until you check with your pediatrician. if you have other questions about how and when to feed your baby please visit the webmd newborn & baby community. you may also want to check out this slideshow on what to feed your baby. (note the slideshow says you can introduce baby food/cereal at 4 months of age but i disagree with that advice. you can't go wrong by waiting. ) wishing you and baby well!

Question: can a cold sore give me genital herpes? . recently my girlfriend gave me a blowjob. she had a cold sore on her lower lip. although the sore was completely scabbed over and is almost completely healed. she got it two weeks ago and has been using some type of medicine to get it healed. the bj lasted 15 seconds and the scab barely touched my penis. the sore isn't open at all so is there still a high risk of infection? whenever we make-out when she has a cold sore i never get one. and she generally gets them when she's really stressed.
Baseline Response: you need to use a lot of condoms, you'll need to get your fingers out of the condoms before she gets the cold sore. your body will usually do this when you are not in the mood to do anything. she needs to get used to the sensation of the cold and her body will take care of it. it's the body that will take the stress

Expected Response: there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good.

Question: i was treated for chlamydia but had protected sex one day after treatment. should i retest?
Baseline Response: Yes, you can. If you have chlamydialysis, you will need to wait until you are at least 18 years old, which is the age you are supposed to be treated. If your symptoms are similar to those of a chlamysm, the risk of infection is very low.
Answer (12/17/2018): I was treated at the age of 18 but had no chlamymyroiditis. I had a chlodex or a condom with a dilation valve that I was given to treat my chlamyroid.

Who is at increased risk for heart disease?
Children with high blood pressures are at an even higher risk.
People with high cholesterol and high blood sugar are at a

Expected Response: the risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include: gender. gallstones form more commonly in women than men. age. gallstone prevalence increases with age. obesity. obese people are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. pregnancy. women who have been pregnant are more likely to form gallstones than women who have not been pregnant. pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy bile contains more cholesterol and the gallbladder does not contract normally. birth control pills and hormone therapy the increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. rapid weight loss. rapid weight loss by whatever means very low calorie diets or obesity surgery causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost but many do not. moreover until they are gone they may cause problems. crohn's disease. individuals with crohn's disease of the terminal ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. gallstones form because patients with crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. normally bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body in the terminal ileum and are secreted again by the liver into bile. in other words the bile acids recycle. in crohn's disease the terminal ileum is diseased. bile acids are not absorbed normally the body becomes depleted of bile acids and less bile acids are secreted in bile. there are not enough bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile and gallstones form. increased blood triglycerides. gallstones occur more frequently in people with elevated blood triglyceride levels. risk for pigment gallstones black pigment gallstones form whenever there is an increased load of bilirubin that reaches the liver. this occurs whenever there is increased destruction of red blood cells as there is in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. black pigment gallstones also are more common among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow) for example when there are narrow obstructed bile ducts.

Question: how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me? can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time? . how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair?
Baseline Response: it takes about a month for a lot of hair to grow.
Solution: if you have a lot, it takes a lot longer to see improvement in hair.
Answer 1: a lot can be achieved in a month.
1.1. What is the best way to use Rogaine for baldness?
1.- The easiest way to get a good scalp is to use a topical Rogaine.
2.- Rogaine can be used to help reduce the hair loss and hair loss induced by beard oil.
3.- Rogane can help improve the health and hair growth of your hair. It can also help with the hair growth induced by shaving your beard.
4.- Roganes are best for the baldness of your scalp.

Expected Response: this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there. so i will try to address all of them for you. first of all the sooner you start using the products; whether it's rogaine and/or propecia the better off you are because it's much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards. so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed; whether it's in the temple area or in the crown that's when you start going. the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone. so it doesn't become like one and one is two it's more like one and one is four or five. so they are that much better together. it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them. so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point.

Question: what are the risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse?
Baseline Response: it is a very common problem that some people are unable to prevent from developing pelvic organ failure.
One of the main reasons is that the pelvic organ is located in the abdomen.
When the pelvic organs are in the abdominal cavity, they often form a very large hole.
It is very difficult to have an organ that is located there.
There are many reasons for the problem, but one of the most common are the following:
The pelvic organs can be removed by the use of an external instrument, such as a needle, or the use and use of a manual instrument.
This can be done without causing an organ failure or even with a person who is not a doctor.
For those who have had a pelvic organ injury, the use is usually done without a doctor's intervention.
The risk factors of pelvic organ dysfunction include:
Oral infections (PLL),
Patellar g

Expected Response: the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. "stretch marks " you might be thinking "why would that be? " the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks.

Baseline Response: I'm a very young woman. I have been taking the drug for a long time. I was never sexually active, i'm a virgin. i used to take biotin for a very long time before I decided to start using it. i still do that today and i want to do it again. i don't know how to tell if i'm going to get pregnant or not

Expected Response: i would try one more test just to be on the safe side. supplements can have different effects on every woman. if it's not the supplement making you late any change in stress factors or hormone changes can cause you to be late.

Question: is feet swelling a side effect of bactrim use. i just finished my 2nd round of bactrim. on my first round my two on my right foot were turning dark purple under the skin. his diagnosis was that i had cellulitis. one foot was cool to the touch and the other was very warm. he prescribed a 10 day regimen of bactrim to be taken orally twice a day. after the first round it seemed that the bactrim had done the trick and that it had worked. not so about a week later the same foot was swollen again. not sure what to make of it.
Baseline Response: it is a side effects issue, not a health issue. if you are taking bactromazole, you should check the label to make sure that you are not taking any side effects.

Expected Response: you need to contact your doctor again. he or she should be aware the foot swelling has returned. this could indicate the cellulitis has not been cured or that something else is going on. swelling of the feet is not a common side effect of bactrim. wishing you well!

Question: hypothyroidism does this make your hair fall out in unusual amounts?
Baseline Response: If you are a hypothyrogynecologist, it is not a bad thing. If you have any allergies to other foods, you may want to avoid those foods.
What's the difference between hypothyroxyl-thyroidism and thyroiditis?
What is hypothyrosclerosis?
Hypothyroiditis is a condition in which the thyroid gland is damaged and the thyroid glands become dysfunctional.
Hypthyroiditis may be caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone or by an imbalance of thyroid hormones, which means that your thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone to produce thyroid hormone.
How can I get thyroiditis if I have hypothyronitis? What's the best way to get thyroidopathy?
Toxic and inflammatory thyroiditis is caused by the accumulation of thyroid follicles and the accumulation and destruction of the thyroid hormones.
Tropic thyroiditis can

Expected Response: unfortunately for me it did; by the handful! especially in the shower. hair growth follows a 3-6 month cycle so if you have just started taking thyroid meds it may take a few months until you see any improvement. i took biotin (5 000mcg) & it has helped.

Question: how long should sutures remain in face
Baseline Response: The suturing period may be as long as three years, but it can be shorter. The suture should be in place for several years. The body should be completely drained of blood, but not so much that the blood is so thin that it cannot be discharged from the suture. A suture can be made by using a sponge or a cloth and then wrapping it around the sutured area. The sponge or cloth should be placed over the sutra and covered with a layer of hair. The hair should be wrapped around the severed body. If the suta is too heavy to carry, the hair should also be wrapped about the sutor.
If the suti is too loose, the suttas are not allowed to be used. If a suture is too tight, the body is not allowed the use of suturals. If one has been used for a long time, he

Expected Response: it depends on the location of the laceration and size and complexity of the repair but generally i like to take out the skin sutures in five days if the wound is healing well not infected and the laceration is not in a spot that is under "tension". they can remain in longer but scaring potential increases so many clinicians will remove them at five days and reinforece the wound repair with steri-strips (special adhesive strips) for some additional healing time.
================================================================================
Question: does a migraine always include pain or can you just have light sensitivity?
Baseline Response: yes, the problem is that a migraine does not always include any pain or discomfort. If you have a migraine, you may have headaches when you are doing other activities or when you have an exercise. This is normal, but if you are experiencing a headache, the migraine may cause a migraine. If your headache is a migraine or you do not have a headache or your headaches are not present, you can have an open, painful migraine.
The migraine is a problem that arises from an underlying cause, such as an inflammation of the brain, that has not been resolved before.
Symptoms of a migraine are usually a headache. When the headache occurs, the brain gets involved in the action of the migraine and then the migraine attacks the brain. This causes a headache that is not immediately present.
When you have your migraine, it is difficult to know what to do. It is easy to make

Question: why is a liver biopsy important for managing chronic hepatitis c?
Baseline Response: A liver biopsies are a valuable tool in the management of chronic hepatitis C. The liver biopies are taken by a physician to assess the liver function and the ability to metabolize the hepatitis virus. The biopsy can be done by a liver specialist, a specialist in liver biotechnology, or a physician in a general practitioner's office.
In the case of chronic liver disease, the biopsy is important to identify the cause of the disease and determine if there is a risk to the liver.
This is especially important in patients with cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis C is the most common cause of liver failure in the United States.
There are currently no published published studies examining the effectiveness of liver biopedies in treating chronic hepatitis.
The most common reasons for not taking a liver-biopsy are:
The patient has not been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis,
The biopsy

Expected Response: blood tests can tell the clinician whether hepatitis c infection is present but cannot tell the level of liver damage that has occurred. liver biopsy allows the clinician to determine how much inflammation and scarring are present in a small sample of liver tissue. liver biopsy may be recommended when the clinician is uncertain about whether to begin treatment or wishes to monitor the response within the liver to therapy.

Answer. i have had this problem for about a year and i was able to get it resolved by using the second one. i used to use this lotion all day and it was very effective. i just tried this and it just did

Expected Response: are you just interested on creams and drugs which are useful to cure your skin problem or else any other source which can cure it. it is necessary to consult a dermatologist to judge on what type of rash you are suffering from and have to treat it. but before that why can't you just try products which can cure your skin problem naturally. usage of products with natural ingredients can help you to recover from many type of skin problems. best you can have from online search are products made out of argan nuts which might give positive results than other.

Question: can suppliments like whey protein shakes enhance height in a 14 year old male who is 5' 1'' now? . the young man is from nepal with mother's height of 5' father at 5' 8. young man is active soccer player in excellent health. consumes generally indo-nepali meals and fast foods (w/o beef). he is asking for height enhancing drugs/ supplements. any advice to parents?
Baseline Response: no, you can't.
Answer #1: if you are a 5'9'' tall boy and you are not an active athlete, you have a genetic predisposition to gain weight. If you are 5'5'' tall, you are genetically predisposed to gain a weight of 5.0 to 5.7 pounds. if you were 5'4'' tall and you were not an athlete, the weight you gained is only 5.2 pounds.

Expected Response: there are no height-enhancing drugs or diets. any claims that this can help would be false. this young man should have a consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist. this is the specialist who can determine if hgh (human growth hormone) therapy would be appropriate in his particular case.

Question: is a 92 a fail for a drug test. i took a test friday 12/27/2013. today i received a call from the clinic telling me i failed my drug test. positive for thc and the doctor said something about 92. i'm not sue if he was talking about 92% fail or 92ng/ml found in urine. he said the results were low but i still need help. please help.
Baseline Response: i'm sorry to hear that you are trying to mislead me by saying that 93 is a fail. it's not. the results are low and i will not be suing. my only goal is to get my test results back to the lab so that i can get tested and get my medicine back.
I've got the following questions:
1. Is there a 95% fail for your drug test?
2. What is the difference between a 92 and a 93?
3. Are there any problems with your testing?
4

Expected Response: i can't answer that question without seeing the entire test but a 92 whatever that indicated is certainly more than a "0" so you did fail your drug test. does this surprise you? if so you may have to ask for another test.
================================================================================
Question: what are complications of hypothyroidism?
Baseline Response: I'm not sure. It's hard to say, but if you have a thyroid problem, it's often a result of a combination of medications. But if you're not getting thyroid hormone replacement therapy, then you may not be getting thyroid replacement therapy. If you have the condition, you might be getting some of the benefits of thyroid hormone therapy.
I've seen people who were in a situation where they had an elevated level of thyroid hormones, and the doctor said, "Well, I'm not going to try this." They said, well, that's a different question. I know I'm a little bit of a skeptic about that.
So, I think the first step is to start looking at what's going on with your thyroid. If it's in your body, that would be a good thing to do. It would be nice if there's a chance that you might get a better result.

Expected Response: untreated hypothyroidism may cause: heart problems infertility joint pain obesity thyroid problems in a pregnant woman can affect the developing baby. during the first three months of pregnancy the baby receives all thyroid hormone from its mother. if the mother has hypothyroidism the baby does not get enough thyroid hormone. this can lead to problems with mental development. extremely low levels of thyroid hormone can cause a life-threatening condition called myxedema. myxedema is the most severe form of hypothyroidism. a person with myxedema can lose consciousness or go into a coma. the condition can also cause the body temperature to drop very low which can cause death.

Question: besides encouraging fitness and nutrition how else can i help my child lose weight?
Baseline Response: My child has a small body mass index (BMI), which is measured in kg/m2 (kg/m3). I believe that it is important to understand that BMI is a measure of body fat. BMI is calculated by dividing the sum of all the fat in the body by the weight in the fat body.
When my child has lost weight, I recommend that he eat a good amount of fat. This is because he will have a bigger fat mass.
I recommend that when my child's weight has dropped, he or she should consume a good meal. He or she may also eat a lot of vegetables, fruits and vegetables. I also recommend that his or her diet should be healthy.

Expected Response: let me share three elements that i’ll bet you didn’t realize impact so significantly upon childhood obesity. . 1. tv in the bedroom: having a tv in the bedroom often leads to sedentary behavior as well as overeating. kids literally go into a trance for hours staring at the tube while mindlessly stuffing their faces with too many calories which includes a large amount of junk. get these tvs out of their bedrooms! 2. not sitting down together for meals: few families sit down together for a meal especially at dinnertime. kids frequently fend for themselves and often take their food to other parts of the house and eat there. how about parents mentor their kids and structure meals such that there’s time to sit and talk and enjoy healthy food together? heck prepare the meal together! it’s such a win-win. 3. not getting enough sleep: sleep deprivation goes hand in hand with the tv in the bedroom along with high-tech toys that are distracting kids 24/7. kids need at least nine hours of sleep. parents need to monitor this and make sure each child is getting enough zzzs.

Question: can you spill keatones with type 2 diabetes?
Baseline Response: yes, but it's not an easy one. There are a lot of different types of keatone. There is no specific type of keato, there is no particular type of type 2 type keato. The specific type is the type of the keato you are drinking.

Question: the two ferrous gluconate tablets i take daily upset my stomach. is there an alternative to get my iron?
Baseline Response: the best option is to use a natural iron like magnesium oxide.
How to use the tablet
1. Take 1-3 tablets.
2. Place them in a warm room with a lid.
3. Put them in your mouth.
4. Drink them.
5. Take them with you.
6. Use them to relieve the tension in your stomach.
7. Take some water and drink.
8. Take a break.
9. Take the tablets.

Expected Response: iron alone is harsh on the stomach. ferrous sulfate rather than gluconate is more commonly used and in an enteric coating to help decrease the tendencies of upset stomach. take the medication with food. you also can take it twice daily rather than two tablets at once. in addition the slow-absorption iron may aid in decreasing the upset stomach effects.

Question: how is spondylolisthesis and stenosis affected by exercise and what restrictions are necessary?
Baseline Response: exercise is a major stressor for many of us. It is often a sign of stress and it is often caused by stressors such as:
• high levels of stress in the body
• stress on the joints, muscles and joints in general
• changes in blood pressure
• other factors such as stress on blood vessels, blood pressure, blood sugar and insulin levels
• increased blood pressure and insulin resistance
• poor nutrition and diabetes
• a poor immune system, including immune system dysfunction
• low immune function
• problems with immune system function, including infection, infections and infections
• lack of sleep
• excessive weight gain and weight loss
• difficulty with eating or sleeping
• diabetes
Solution: if you have a high blood pressure or diabetes, consider taking a diabetes medication. If you are unable to tolerate the medication, you may be at risk

Expected Response: spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over an adjacent vertebra. it typically occurs in the lumbar spine and is the result of an injury to or degeneration of one or both of the facet joints of the bone. facet joints help support the weight of the spine and control movement (extension flexion and twisting). symptoms of spondylolisthesis although not present in everyone (it depends on the degree of slippage) can include pain in the low back thighs or legs. pain is due to inflammation of the facet joint or compression impingement or shear forces on a disc. the condition is also associated with muscle spasms weakness and tightness (low back and hamstrings). exercises that emphasize proper body mechanics and stabilize the spine during movements like flexion and extension and stretches for the low back and hamstrings should be prescribed. pelvic tilts abdominal crunches with legs on a chair leg raises (with knees bent and abdominal muscles contracted the bent knee is lifted) and gluteal piriformis and hamstring stretches can all be helpful. proper ergonomics while seated at a desk proper posture while standing and safe lifting technique should all be taught. exercises to avoid are forward bending without the knees bent and abdominals tight bending forward while twisting and any other movement that causes pain. exercises should be individualized depending on the symptoms type and grade of spondylolisthesis. no exercises should be performed if the individual has symptoms and exercises that cause pain should be stopped immediately. you should speak with your client's doctor before you prescribe any exercises and i recommend that you become familiar with the anatomy and biomechanics of the injury as well as the effects of different exercises on the spine.

Expected Response: most helpful answer keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you. steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you. this is not something you can do at home or with any over-the-counter medications. surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed.

Question: what causes penile cancer?
Baseline Response: penile tumor is a type of cancer that can be treated with chemotherapy. It is a very rare form of cancer. The risk of penile tumours is much higher than for other cancers. However, there are many other types of peniles, such as penile ulcers, penile cysts, penises, and prostate cancer.
Penile cancer is caused by a tumor that is present in the vagina. The vagina is the part of the body that contains the lining of the vagina that contains blood. This is where the lining is located. This lining is called the vagina, and is a place where the blood and mucus are coming from.

One of the most common types of prostate cancer is known as penicillinal cancer. It can be caused by either a tumor or by an enlarged prostate gland.

Expected Response: the exact cause of penile cancer is not known but there are certain risk factors for the disease. a risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. the risk factors for cancer of the penis may include the following: uncircumcision. men who are not circumcised at birth have a higher risk for getting cancer of the penis. human papilloma virus (hpv) infection. hpv includes more than 100 types of viruses that can cause warts (papillomas). certain types of hpv can infect the reproductive organs and the anal area. these types of hpv are passed from one person to another during sexual contact. smoking. smoking exposes the body to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than the lungs. smegma. oily secretions from the skin can accumulate under the foreskin of the penis. the result is a thick bad-smelling substance called smegma. if the penis is not cleaned thoroughly the presence of smegma can cause irritation and inflammation. phimosis. this is a condition in which the foreskin becomes constricted and difficult to retract. treatment for psoriasis. the skin disease psoriasis is sometimes treated with a combination of medication and exposure to ultraviolet light which may increase a person's risk for penile cancer. age. over half of the cases of penile cancer occur in men over age 68.

Baseline Response: I am not taking any other medications for this STI. I am taking the following: anti-polio (polio), a drug that is designed to block the development of STI in the gut, but also to help in preventing ST

Expected Response: other stds can have few if any symptoms early in the disease process. when you get one std from unprotected sex you are more likely to get others. perhaps from the same person/sexual encounter. chlamydia often travels with other "friends". and these friends you do not need. so it is wise to be tested for other common stds. just in case.

Question: what's wrong with me? i have symptoms of paranoid maladptive daydreaming anxiety disorder. i think i'm paranoid i have most symptoms of it i also have this maladaptive daydreaming and usually about sad stories where i always cry i oftenly do lucid dreaming i have anxiety disorder i feel shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat always. i don't know if i am traumatized but i never thought of having suicide never. are these just the effect stress? i thought everytime i'm going crazy already. i wanna know what's wrong with me? thank you for answering and i think i also need advices
Baseline Response: i'm not sure what the cause of my symptoms are. i'm quite young and i'm very sensitive to certain things. i've been having the same daydreams for a long time. i was very curious how i got started and what i think caused the symptoms. i thought i was having a psychotic episode but i was not.

Expected Response: one of your questions is " are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? " i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not "crazy" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that it’s as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future.

Question: what is teething?
Baseline Response: teetering is the term used by the Chinese for the idea that the body is teeming with energy and then having a state of unselfishness or selflessness.
It is a concept that is often misunderstood in Western societies, but it is still a powerful one.
In China, teeters are usually described as a people who are selfless and brave.
Teetering in China is a word that has been used in the past to refer to people who have overcome adversity, are motivated by self-sacrifice, and are willing to take risks.
I was taught in the early 20th century that the word teetered means that you are not the only one who is teering.
You have to be prepared for that.
Many people in China believe that teetards are like children who are always looking for something to be happy about.
One of the most common forms of teetling

Question: what should i do if i suspect an overdose of lidopain?
Baseline Response: use a nasal spray and do not use a lidopatoxin.
The first thing you should do is check your nasal spray.
If it is too small, try a different formulation.
Do not try this if you are allergic to lidopan.
It is the same as using lidopadil or lidopasil.
I have found that lidopacin works as a lidotoxin and that it is not very effective in treating this problem.
In the past I have used lidopastil or a similar drug that was not effective in curing this problem, but now I am using lidotoxicol which is a very different drug.
How to use lidopalloxaparin
First of all, you need to know what the best formulation is for you.
Use the following formula:
Lipopastitil
Lime

Expected Response: if overdose is suspected remove the patch. this medicine may be harmful if swallowed. contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. canadian residents should call their local poison control center directly. symptoms of overdose may include severe drowsiness seizures slowed breathing slow/fast/irregular heartbeat.

Question: why are men's bathrooms so dirty?
Baseline Response: The answer is simple. Because women are more likely to be sexually assaulted by men in their 20s than their 30s.
Many of these men, especially men who have a very low socioeconomic background, may be unaware that their sexual assault is a result of domestic violence, a lack of sexual education, or a lack in the ability to trust and trust their partners.
The reason for this is simple: men who are sexually assaulted are more prone to develop depression, anxiety, and other symptoms of depression than women who are not sexually assaulted.
How do you know if a woman is sexually assaulted?
When you look at your own personal experience of rape, you may find that many of the symptoms of sexual assault are common. It is very important to ask yourself if there are any other possible causes of your sexual assault. If so, you will know that you are not alone.
What about the emotional and psychological effects of

Expected Response: according to a recent study 85 percent of americans are washing their hands after using a public bathroom; improved from 77 percent a few years ago. the other 15 percent are contaminating the rest of our world. nearly three times as many women wash their hands than men however. apparently men have a prevailing assumption that if you don’t pee on your fingers you don’t need to wash your hands. personally i am not overly worried about the pee-guys but i do worry about the men behind those stall doors. men’s restrooms are considerably nastier than the women’s facilities (so i am told). if i am forced to use a public restroom i try not to touch anything if i can help it. i consider bathrooms stalls the most contaminated rooms on this planet. i would love to put on some type of biological hazard suit but this isn’t practical. i have seen impatient dancing women quickly use a men’s room when the line to the women’s restroom is too long. it only takes one of these experiences to truly appreciate the difference. for the first time i would like to reveal the inner workings of a typical men’s room. there is usually a bank of urinals against one wall about five. men do not like to stand side by side with another man peeing so whenever possible an unused urinal becomes the “buffer. ” some urinals have little walls between them but most are open. there may or may not be a lower urinal for little boys. in the stalls i would be shocked not to find urine on the seat. even though urine is usually sterile no one wants to ever sit on it. men like urinals (sort of) but little boys do not. they are either too short to use them or too shy. given a choice little boys head for the stall where they will freely pee on the seat the floor and the flush handle before finding their mark. i would be shocked not to find sticky urine on the floor near the toilet. men do not like to sit on strange toilets. given the choice they prefer the one at home well-stocked with reading material. unlike women men have not developed the fine art of toilet seat hovering. men are accustomed to sitting down and reading for a while. women typically pee and leave. no one really knows the best toilet stall to use. i guess the best one would be the handicap stall but that isn’t very nice to occupy. most will use the stall most distant from the door however you do tend to select the one that looks the cleanest and has a flushed toilet. if you must use a stall you really don’t want to pick a stall next to an actively occupied one. it can be disconcerting to hear all of those bathroom noises next door or see someone’s shoes tapping out a silent tune. i do witness men washing their hands but a two-second splash of water and maybe a little soap is not thorough hand-washing. (to learn how to do it right watch the webmd video how and when to wash your hands. ) if there are paper towels available men will use them. if there is an electric hand-dryer most will not stand there long enough to get their hands dry. they will them dry on their pants and just leave. restroom doors tend to open inward which means that your clean hands will need to touch a door handle freshly contaminated by the non-handwashers. i usually just hang around long enough for someone to come in and then i will shoot out before the door closes. growing up in appalachia we had outdoor toilets at my junior high. there was no running water to wash your hands. because of this frightening experience i learned to hold it all day if need be rather than use this outhouse. this ability has served me well over the years. unless i am truly desperate i do not use a public restroom. i used to work for an office cleaning company and the women's restrooms were worse. they would not sit on the seats. their pee would spray all over.

Question: what causes smelly feet?
Baseline Response: a person's foot is the joint that connects the foot to the ground. In some cases, the feet may be flat, or they may be exposed to water or other hazards.
Answer 2: what is a smelly foot?
A smelly shoe is a shoe that is worn and attached to the foot, and is usually worn over a shoe.
In some cases it may be worn with a short-sleeved shoe. In others, it may only be worn by a person who is not a footwear expert.

Question: can i treat pain from mouth uclers using advil? (ibuprofen). i've been experiencing pain from mouth ulcers for a few days now. and i was just wondering if it was possible to treat the pain with advil and if it would make a difference if i used it or not.
Baseline Response: no, the pain is not caused by any other medications or drugs. The pain can be treated by using an inhaler or a nasal spray.
Also, it is possible to get rid of the symptoms of the ulcers by using a small amount of a medicine that has been prescribed to you. For example, a lot of painkillers are prescribed to treat ulcers.
So, if you do have a problem with your mouth ulcer, you can try to avoid it.
I hope this has helped you.

Question: what can i expect during week 20 of my pregnancy?
Baseline Response: I'll have a little more time to prepare for this one, but it will be pretty intense. I'll probably have a few more days of sleep before I start to feel better. I don't want to get out of bed for a few days at a time. I'm really hoping that the first few days of pregnancy are OK, but I'll be able to get through that. I know I've been in a pretty rough place so far this week.
I'm hoping that my mom will be okay and that I can get through this with her. It's really hard to get your mom to believe that you're going to be okay after you get pregnant. I hope that she has the strength to help you through that, but there are a lot of things that can go wrong for you. I'd love to help with that.
My baby is my first. I will be a good mom.

Expected Response: baby : the fetus measures about 5. 6 to 6. 4 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 9 ounces. your baby can hear sounds by now -- your voice heart and your stomach growling as well as sounds outside your body. it will cover its ears with its hands if a loud sound is made near you and it may even become startled and "jump. " the baby is moving often too -- twisting turning wiggling punching and kicking. mom-to-be : congratulations! you're at about the midpoint of your pregnancy. your uterus is just about even with your navel. your waistline has pretty much disappeared but only temporarily! the risk of bladder infections increases because the smooth muscles in the urinary tract relax. your breathing will become deeper and you may perspire more than usual from a more active thyroid gland. tip of the week : to alleviate backaches maintain good posture. sit with a footstool or use an ergonomic chair at the office avoid standing for too long sleep with a small pillow under your side at the waist and lift things with your legs instead of your back.
================================================================================
Question: what is tsh?
Baseline Response: it is a bit of a mess. It is an extension of the tsh module. tsh is a library of a very specific type, which is a T that takes a number of arguments, and then performs a given computation. It takes a T as an argument, and a list of all the functions it calls. It then performs the computation with a list, and returns the result.
For example, the following code is equivalent to the following:
import tsh.tsh.T import tsh._ def tsh(a, b): return t(a + b) def tp(a): return a + b return tp()
And we see that the tp function returns the list of functions, and the tpr function returns a list that is the list.
Now, what is the difference between the two?
The T is an abstraction that is part of the T. It does not take

Expected Response: tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment.

Question: can a laser be used for a brazilian hair removal? how do i inquire if this can be done; it's rather embarrassing to ask.
Baseline Response: The laser is a small, flat, light beam that can be used to remove hair in a bisphenol A (BPA) solution. A BPA solution contains two ingredients, BPA and BHA, which are naturally occurring compounds. The BPA can be purchased from Bisphenols.
In order to obtain the BPA from a bhalic acid solution, the BHA can be added to the solution and the BSA can be dissolved in water.
The procedure for removing hair is the same as for bhalothiophene, except that the bhalophene is applied over the hair and the bHA is added directly to the hair.
So it's not only a hair removal procedure, but also a procedure that is quite simple and not very complicated.
We would

Expected Response: laser hair removal can be done on any part of the body where there is hair. so what we tell our patients as dermatologists is that any pattern that you shave to is what we can follow with that laser. dermatologists are very comfortable with any part of the skin so this is a conversation that you should have very easily with your doctor. just tell them what you are looking for and the pattern that you would like. and they can follow that for you. it could be a little bit more painful so we often recommend using a topical anesthetic for 30-45 minutes before the treatment.

Question: pinkeye. concerning the discharge. i have only the occasional 'crust' from sleeping but do have what appear to be 'strings' of a mucus like substance that forms in my lower eyelid. i frequently just touch it and pull it out. its white in color and seems to not want to go away. i had thought maybe it was from an allergen but i dont have allergies to speak of nor is this a seasonal thing. is this something i should be concerned about?
Baseline Response: This is a very common issue and I have seen it in my own family. I have a lot of allergies to the air and my allergies to air can get so bad that the only solution is to take an allergy test. if it is not clear what the problem is, i will take the test and if it turns out that it is a problem, i'll take the allergy test and see if i can find something that is causing it.
Answer, I do not

Expected Response: it is normal to have some morning accumulation of fluid or mucous-like substance in the corners of the eye. thinner drainage like tears will drain down the nasolacrimal duct into your nose and not be noticed. the thicker material just can make it through this tiny drainage tube. the eye is always secreting tears and lubrication (from oil-like glands under the eyelid) so this is not really alarming. true pink eye (conjunctivitis) is typically painful and the drainage is copious all day long. allergic conjunctivitis tends to itch and last a long long time. making a self-diagnosis can be difficult so if you are concerned then you can address this problem with your medical provider or even optometrist.

Question: am i able to get lice from hugging somebody who had been recently infested and having head-to-head contact for a second?
Baseline Response: the reason that I can't get lices is because my husband has been infested. We have had a lot of contact over the years, and I think that if you have had contact with someone in a relationship for a while, you are susceptible to getting lice. I think if you are infested with lice you are more likely to get an infection.
I don't know if you could get limes from hugging someone who has been recently infected. I know that if I had an infection with limes, I would be able to have lice with my husband, but it would take a lot more time.

Question: what are side effects of drugs used to treat genital herpes?
Baseline Response: There is no evidence that there is a causal relationship between use of oral contraceptives and genital herpes.
This question has been asked many times in the medical literature and has been answered many times by other researchers. However, there are a number of things that need to be considered.
First, the amount of time it takes for an individual to begin using an oral contraceptive. For example, when you take the pill twice a day, it takes a month to stop using it. It takes a year to stop taking the pill. As you take more pills, you also begin to feel the effects of the drugs.
Second, the number of side effects that occur. A number of studies have reported that some people who take oral contraceptives have a significant increase in the number and severity of side-effects. In addition, the frequency with which these side effects occur may vary, and they may be more frequent than others.

Expected Response: there are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (zovirax) famciclovir (famvir) and valacyclovir (valtrex). these are all taken in pill form. severe cases may be treated with intravenous (iv) acyclovir. side effects with these drugs are considered mild and health experts believe these drugs are safe in the long term. acyclovir is the oldest of the three and its safety has been documented in people taking suppressive therapy for several years. people taking suppressive therapy should see their doctor at least once a year to decide if they should continue.

Baseline Response: yes, i have been on different brands of brand for a few years now. i've never had any problems at all.
The reason why I had

Expected Response: most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking.

Question: can swaddling a baby help during a nap?
Baseline Response: it's a good idea to ask for an ultrasound before you start a nap. If you don't have a nap, you can ask to have an ultrasound with your baby. If your baby is in the NICU and you don' want to have your baby taken to the hospital, you should ask to see a nurse.
How to Obtain an Ultrasound
You can get an ultrasound by calling the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). If you have questions about your baby's health, the NICHD will answer them in the order you gave them. If they do not respond to your questions, they can be contacted by calling 1-800-ICHD-PEDES (1-800) 720-8255. The NICHD may also provide you with information about your child's health.
Do you need a private ultrasound?
No. The National Institutes of

Expected Response: if swaddling helps baby sleep at night there's no reason you shouldn't do so during the day. just remember to avoid wrapping the hips too tightly and to stop swaddling once baby is mobile enough to roll around and possibly become tangled in the blanket. wearable sleep blankets (like a mini sleeping bag) may also be a good option.

Question: tested first time bs fast 135 pp 180 and s. chol 255. is choles due to diabetes or otherwise or both are independant?
Baseline Response: I believe it depends on what you mean by "independent." The way to determine if you're independent is to test yourself. If you're not independent, then you're in the middle of a diabetes epidemic, but you have no diabetes.
This is a bit different from my other questions. First, I don't know if you have diabetes. If so, what is your current status?
The Diabetes Care Center is a community-based, non-profit organization that works to help people with diabetes. They have a lot of resources, but they're not really going to make you or anyone else happy. They want you to feel good and feel good about yourself. They are not going to let you down, and they want you in good health. They will make you feel better, and you will feel better about

Expected Response: actually the answer is a bit complicated. high cholesterol and diabetes are independent risk factors for heart disease. some people may have one or the other. but many people have both and they do appear to be related. scientists are studying the effects that high blood sugars and insulin resistance have on the different types of fats in the blood. insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. it helps the cells in the body take up and use glucose for energy. in diabetes the cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. glucose then builds up in the blood. the more resistant the cells are to insulin the higher the triglycerides and ldl (or bad cholesterol) levels become. at the same time the hdl (or good cholesterol) levels fall. but the good news is that both diabetes and high cholesterol can respond to the same healthy lifestyle changes. talk to your doctor about positive changes that you can make in your diet and exercise habits that can put you back on the road to good health. webmd is a great source of information about diabetes and about high cholesterol. here are two links to get you started. <link> <link> you may also want to talk to a diabetes educator or nutritionist. they can help create a diet plan that is right for you.

Question: got dtap vaccine week ago. injection area is swollen and has knot gets sorer every day. is this normal?
Baseline Response: not normal, it's just a bug.
Answer : I'm not sure what's the problem. I think it's a bug, but I don't know if it's the one that's causing this.

Expected Response: soreness at the injection site is probably the most common adverse effect especially with the dtap. often this is not just due to vaccine but the trauma of the needle and some bleeding into the tissue (usually this is the cause of the "knot"). warm compresses may help as well as some ibuprofen for the inflammation. if it becomes red and more swollen you will need to see your medical provider to see if you have a injection site infection.

If she is a woman who has car insurance and she is married and she wants to get a car and she does not have insurance, then the insurance is paid by her car insurance company, and she gets paid by a car insurance policy.
In that case, she will get the money from the insurance policy, and her insurance policy will pay for the car insurance.
For example, if she is in a car that is insured, then she will have a car policy that pays for the insurance, and the policy pays for her insurance. So if she wants a car, then it will pay her the car

Expected Response: no. if you're already covered by medicaid that will not change under the new law.

Question: if my child has food allergies how best can i prepare for summer vacation?
Baseline Response: I will be cooking for myself. I will start by making the dough, and then add some salt and pepper, and continue making the other ingredients until I have a nice dough. I use a 4 x 8 x 4 inch pan, and I use an 11" x 12" baking pan. I don't know if you can use a 2 x 4 or 4 x 4 x 2 inch pan for a double boiler or double boiler, but I think it is a better choice.
The dough will be very thin. I'll add some water and some oil, then add more flour. I have used a dough cutter to cut my dough.
I use a 1/2" x 1" long, circular cutter. I do not use a double-bake pan, so I do it with a 1" x 4" pan.
Do not use an oil like the one I used

Expected Response: summers are frequently a busy time with many children off [on] school and summer trips. for parents with food allergic children it is easy to forget the epi pen when packing for trips. also when food allergic kids are out of their routine it is also easier to accidently ingest a food they typically avoid. many parents find it helpful to put together an extra small bag/pouch with benadryl epi pens and important phone numbers to carry on vacation.

Question: i have a bump underneath the tip of my tongue. what is it? . i have a sort of bubble like thing underneath the tip of my tongue. it is red and sticks out a good half inch. it is very tender and hurts when it is squeezed. if you look closely at it you can see a blood vessel. what is this?
Baseline Response: the blood vessels are very small, they are not the size of a pencil. they are tiny and they are very tight. they can not be pushed out. they need to be pushed back and forth for about 3-4 inches or so. the blood vessel is quite small, it is small and tight. and it is not as thin as a pencil or paper, it has a very thin layer of blood on it. i am not sure if it is a good idea to put it in the bottle and put it out of the bottle, or if it should be put in the glass. the bottle is very very thick

Expected Response: i really don't now since i have no way of seeing this lesion and examining you. a vague description really isn't sufficient to make this important diagnostic call so i suggest that you see your medical provider or even dentist to have this "bubble" properly identified.
================================================================================
Question: i can feel my brain moving around and i haven't done anything such as jumping around or shaking my head. is this normal
Baseline Response: no, it's just a normal state.
Answer 2: I feel like my brain is moving around. I'm not sure if this is normal or not.

Expected Response: normal? no but i am not able to offer you an explanation as to why you feel your brain is moving around. the brain does not move inside the skull incidentally so what you are experiencing is just a sensation of movement. see your medical provider if this feeling does not go away.

Question: what are pain relievers/fever reducers?
Baseline Response: They're not exactly pain relieving. They're just more of an "epidemic" than anything else.
That said, they're not just a pain reliever. They are also a pain reducer.
A pain reducers is something you don't just "do" every day. You have to do it, as you would for a "clean" diet, exercise, etc. You also have to take pain reliever medications.
How do I know if I'm getting enough pain relief?
Pain relievers are generally available at all pharmacies, and some pharmacies even offer them as a supplement for their pain relief.
What are the best pain relieven products?
These are the most popular pain reliever products, and they're also the most used pain relieves.
These products have some really good benefits, and a few of the most important ones are:
They're not all pain

Expected Response: there are two categories of over-the-counter pain relievers/fever reducers: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). acetaminophen is used to relieve headaches muscle aches and fever. it is also found in many other medicines such as cough syrup and cold and sinus medicines. otc nsaids are used to help relieve pain and reduce fever. nsaids include aspirin naproxen ketoprofen and ibuprofen and are also found in many medicines taken for colds sinus pressure and allergies.

Question: as a young adult covered under my employer's health insurance plan i worry about switching jobs and being uninsured. being uninsured for any length of time is not an option for me because of an existing chronic medical condition. what are my healthcare options if i want/need to take time off between jobs? also affordability is important here.
Baseline Response: I have no plans to change my current health care plan so i am happy with my current healthcare plans.

Expected Response: your question touches upon a very important issue and one that many americans struggle with. millions of people either hang onto a job because they can't afford to lose the health insurance or go uninsured which is particularly dangerous for folks like yourself with a chronic condition. job gaps after january 1 2014 will no longer be a concern with regard to health insurance. you'll be able to buy a policy through your state's marketplace and be guaranteed coverage even with a pre-existing health condition. when you lose access to affordable coverage provided by your employer you'll be eligible to buy a plan on your own. likely you'll also qualify for financial assistance to lower your costs.

Question: i am now 14 days late i took a test this morning and it was negative. i haven't been under any stress and i've took several different test but their all negative. but breast are sore i feel fullness and bloating i also have dry mouth and nauseated at times. is it possible that i could be pregnant and still not picking up on the test? and if not whats going on?
Baseline Response: No, we have no clue about the condition or the cause of the test.
Answer 2: i have seen a doctor who says that the test is negative. he has given me a positive result and has asked me to go to a clinic to see if I could have a test. but i am still not sure what is going on.
I am still waiting for my doctor to make a decision. if i am lucky, i may have a blood test or something.

Expected Response: over the counter pregnancy tests are generally very reliable so it unlikely that you are pregnant. however i would recommend that you see your doctor just to make sure since you are having symptoms of being pregnant. your doctor may also do some additional blood work including a thyroid test to evaluate other reasons for the symptoms which you are experiencing.
================================================================================
Question: can i switch from vicodin to advil without waiting for the vicodin to clear my system? . i have shingles (yes i had the shot too) have been taking acyclovir and vicodin. the vic didn't kill the pain so i been adding 2 advil. after 5 days my feet started swelling and i was worried about my kidneys. i read that acy shouldn't be taken with advil so i stopped the adivil 2 days ago. swelling didn't decrease i stopped the acy about 28 hrs. ago still no change in the swelling. i've decided to stop the vic 5-500 and stick with 600 mg. advil.
Baseline Response: no. I am taking a small dose of vicodins. The dose is about 10 mg/kg and I do not feel the pain. The pain has been getting worse and worse. i can not go back to the hospital because i have a big problem.

Expected Response: any patient-specific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it. the vicodin will not be bio-effective after six hours or so so anytime after that.
================================================================================
Question: my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it?
Baseline Response: I have not yet had any problems with shingling, but I'm not sure if I'm getting it or if my husband has shedling. I don't know if shingle is related to a certain condition, but it's probably something I'm in.
I think it's possible that my husband is having a condition that causes shingled hair.
Answer (in order):
I don't think that shingler is related or related to shinglings. I think it is just that shling is more difficult to get if it's not a normal condition.
So, if my husbands shinglers are a bit more difficult, I may be able to get a new shinglet.
My husband has been having shinglets for years. He's had shinglice for years now, and he doesn't

Expected Response: my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus.

Question: bloody diarrhea. this morning i woke up with the urgent need to go to the bathroom. so i went and there was blood in my diarrhea. it was red. not black and tarry. i felt nauseous the rest of the day but no more diarrhea. it happen once. then i had just a little red blood come out of my anus. i have been drinking water no fever and slight dizziness at times. no vomiting either. no stomach pain. i'm just worried about the blood. should i go to the doctor?
Baseline Response: it's my fault. i got this thing on me and i couldn't get it to work. i also had the thing on my arm and i was scared to go out and get it. i don't know if this is just a symptom of my body not being able to handle the things i am about to go through. it could be a sign that I am having problems with my digestion.
Answer
Answer #2:

Expected Response: better visit your doctor for complete evaluation and immediate treatment. bloody diarrhoea is not normal.

Question: can yeast medication help ringworm. crazy but my husband has ringworm all over him and i read some where that its a yeast infection so we went to get medication to cure a yeast infection. i am just asking if this would help or his my husband going to grow boobs? ha
Baseline Response: if yeast infection is a problem then it is not an issue. yeast infection does not affect your growth. It is a symptom of an infection.
So I would say that you need to have a good yeast infection control plan. The doctor has to prescribe medication to help with your yeast infection, but that is not something that you can do on your own. I have seen some patients who are not sure if they are able to get any help from their doctor or if they will need to take some other medications.
What should I do?
There are a lot of things you can try to control yeast infections, but you need them to be controlled.
There is a lot that

Expected Response: assuming your husband was properly diagnosed (many skin lesions will mimic ringworm/tinea corporis) an antifungal medication (there are several over the counter medications that the pharmacist could suggest) would likely help. if you are talking about a vaginal yeast medication being used i would suggest that you use one more geared for skin fungus. he will not grow boobs.

Baseline Response: what the fuck do you mean by "false pregnancy"?
Answer #2: I don't know. I was having a little too much sex. I feel like I have a fever. I have some kind of aneurysm. I am not sure if my symptoms are related to anything else. I'm not sure what to say.
Answer#3: I am fine. I don´t have any problems with my sex. i am fine, i am just not feeling right about it.

Question: i have had a strange itch on my clitoris for a few weeks now. what may be causing this? . my vagina doesn't itch at all but it is dry and has a sour smell every now and then. the itch comes and goes throughout the day and is more annoying than anything else. i use a feminine wash and a feminine deodorant spray. i have tried to alter things by taking them away one by one and then adding them back to see if they were causing the problem but no luck. strangely enough when i went on vacation to the beach for a week the itch went away but returned once i came back home.
Baseline Response: The problem is that i've been using a lot of feminine de-odorant and deodorants for a while now. it seems like every few days my vagina gets a bad itch but i've never had the itch. i just have to take it off and apply it again. i would recommend to try some of these products as

Expected Response: contact allergy could do it. dryer softener sheets with perfume is high on my list followed by enzymatic detergents and bath soaps. it could even be that feminine spray even if you have used it in the past. products often change ingredients without changing the brand name. a yeast infection is quite common in this area so if the itch is limited to the clitoral area use a topical antifungal perhaps mixed half/half with 1% hydrocortisone cream.

Question: is paracetamol is good for cat? . cat is suffering from vomiting and loose motion and its may be fever.
Baseline Response: paracetamic acid is a very effective anti-inflammatory agent. It is used in the treatment of a wide range of diseases such as arthritis, lupus, cataracts, etc.
How long do you use paracetaminol?
Answer, the paracetamate is used to treat pain and nausea. The paracetate is also used in many other medicines such as anti-viral drugs and anti-diseases.

Question: 7 year old daughter just wrecked bike and hit the middle bar cuttingt the right side of her labium. should we get xray? . bleeding is minimal and looks bruised. should i be worried about any internal issues with her and have her seen by a doctor for xrays? .
Baseline Response: My daughter has a very rare disease that she has been diagnosed with. She was born with an abnormal ovaries, which is why she was born without a uterus. She has a low level of testosterone, and when she was in the womb she had a high level of estrogen. Her mother was a vegetarian, but her father was a strict vegetarian. I am so sorry for this mother. I hope she is able to live on her own.

Expected Response: she probably doesn't need an x-ray but she does need a skilled clinician to perform a careful exam. straddle injuries (and i have seen hundreds of them) can cause some significant injuries but most are either repairable (some cause hiddle tears or lacerations requiring sutures) or heal on their own. a gentle and kind medical professional needs to look at those girl parts and see what injuries have occurred. what you can see could only be part of the damage. this exam can be done painless but prepare her for the unavoidable embarrassment of someone looking at her private parts. if she prefers to see a female provider see if this can be arranged. in the meantime put some cool compresses on those painful parts and get her some medical care. don't worry. serious "internal injuries" would not be very likely.

Question: tubal thirty years ago do i have a chance in getting pregnant?
Baseline Response: No, the only way I could get pregnant in the tub is if I had a good boyfriend or girlfriend.
I have tried to get pregnant as soon as I can, but I can't get pregnant with my boyfriend or my girlfriend. I have tried a lot of different methods, but the only one that works for me is the one that I have been using.
Is there a good way to get a good pregnancy?
I know that there are many different ways to get good pregnancy. But I do not know if there are any good methods.
How many days of pregnancy do I have?
If you have been pregnant for more than one day, you will have one day of good pregnancy, but if you have more than two days of good pregnant, you may have two days. If you have a lot more than three days of bad pregnant, it is usually the first day.

Expected Response: unless you had a tubal reversal and a lot of luck. or used in vitro fertilization the chance of you becoming pregnant is extremely slim to none.
================================================================================
Question: what increases a man's risk of infertility?
Baseline Response: It is not known. But it is likely that there are two things: (1) the sperm count of a man and (2) his own fertility.
How does a man become pregnant?
First, the sperm counts of a woman are similar to those of men. This is because the sperm are the same size. This means that a man who has a normal sperm count will have a normal fertility rate. A woman who has normal sperm counts will have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.
The other thing to look for is the sperm that are the size of a human egg. It is the same as the sperm in the human egg, but it is much smaller. This makes it possible to estimate the sperm size of the human body.
What is the likelihood that a woman will have the same risk of ovulation as a man?
The probability of ovulating is usually less than 10%.
Is it

Expected Response: the number and quality of a man's sperm can be affected by his overall health and lifestyle. some things that may reduce sperm number and/or quality include: alcohol drugs environmental toxins including pesticides and lead smoking cigarettes health problems medicines radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer. age

Question: is it ok to delay surgery for kidney cancer for a few months? . urologist said cancer was stage 1
Baseline Response: Yes it is. It is very rare and it takes a few weeks to get the cancer out.
Answer to question #4:
Answer - Yes it may be. It can take a few days for the cancer to grow.
What is the risk of a kidney cancer?
Answer : It is extremely rare, but it is very important that you be aware of the risk.
How do I know if I am getting the cancer?

Expected Response: you have the right to do what you want but does a delay really make medical sense? are you considering this for financial or other personal reasons? i don't know why you would want to delay. i don't know you or your case to advise you in this matter so i strongly suggest that you take the expert advice of the urologist who is treating you or see a second urologist for an official "second opinion".
================================================================================
Question: can extensively drug-resistant (xdr) tuberculosis be treated and cured?
Baseline Response: Yes, it can. But it's not always a good idea.
Tobacco use in Africa, for example, has been increasing rapidly. According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 1.7 million TB cases in the world today. In addition, there were 6.5 million TB deaths in the United States in 2011.
Given the current trend in TB, the best way to treat TB is to treat it with a combination of antibiotics, antiviral drugs and antiviral medication.
For example, a combination antibiotic regimen that can be used on a daily basis can prevent TB from spreading to other patients in the future.
The most effective treatment for TB is a combination therapy, known as an antiviral therapy. However, it is not recommended to treat this type of TB in patients with multiple TB infections.
How can TB be cured? A treatment can be done by

Expected Response: yes in some cases. some tuberculosis control programs have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% of affected people. successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the drug resistance the severity of the disease and whether the patient's immune system is weakened.

Question: can dentists treat the elderly if they have moderate dementia?
Baseline Response: yes. There are various methods of treating people with dementia.
1. The best way to treat dementia is to avoid the pain.
2. In order to avoid pain, a person should avoid all food and drink.
3. People with dementia should not drink alcohol.
4. People who are elderly should not smoke.
5. People without dementia should never eat.
6. If a person has dementia, he or she should be treated by an experienced dementia specialist.
7. People taking medication for dementia should always be monitored for possible side effects.
8. It is important that people with mild to moderate dementia are not treated in an emergency.
9. Patients with mild dementia should be taken to a hospital where they can be tested for signs of dementia.

Expected Response: the ideal time to take care of all necessary dental treatments is soon after the person has been diagnosed with dementia. this way only easier maintenance treatments will be needed as the person ages. however the elderly with moderate levels of dementia can be treated and can receive anesthesia. setting a dental appointment early in the day when the person with dementia is most alert may be best. also the caregiver needs to communicate to the person with dementia that he or she is going to the dentist and state the reason for the visit.

Question: other than carbonated drinks and foods that contain sugar or acid what foods are bad for the teeth?
Baseline Response: The food industry is big. They're making a lot of money. They have all kinds of things going on. They are trying to turn the corner and change the world.
But what if they don't do that?
Well, the problem is, I don't think they're going to. I think they'll just go through the motions and make the same thing that they did with sugar or with acid.
I think they will.
Do you have any thoughts about the potential of a diet that's based around foods that are high in sugar or high in acid?
I don't know.
What do you think of the idea that people could lose weight if they ate a diet high in fat or high-glycemic index?
If they eat a diet low in carbohydrates, I think we could lose about 1,000 pounds a year.

Expected Response: unrestricted at-will sugar consumption has long been known to promote tooth decay which is the single most common chronic childhood disease — five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hay fever. a lack of certain nutrients can also make it more difficult for tissues in the mouth to resist infection. the largest calcium depleters are sodas.

Question: my roommate has been throwing up for almost 12 hours (every 30-60 minutes) and is now vomiting bile. how can i help?
Baseline Response: the only way is to get a urine sample and send it to a lab.
If you are having a problem with your urine, please ask a lab doctor or a doctor who can help you.
I have a urinary tract infection and am struggling with the use of antibiotics. How do I go about treating it?
I would like to see your urine test results in order to see if there is any contamination. If there is, then it is safe to take the test. If it is not, then please call your local lab and tell them that you have an infection and that you are sick.
What are some of the benefits of a urine test?
There are many benefits to a urine analysis.
1) Your blood is drawn for the purpose of determining if there are any parasites in your body.

Expected Response: you need to take him to the emergency room as soon as possible. vomiting that does not subside needs to be treated immediately and he can be in a lot of trouble because he can become severely dehydrated (probably already is) which means his body is craving certain nutrients that help his blood pressure and his heart.

Expected Response: hi this is from the uk’s nhs if you do get signs and symptoms these usually appear between one and three weeks after having unprotected sex with an infected person. for some people the symptoms occur many months later or not until the infection has spread. around half of all men with chlamydia don't notice any symptoms. if men do get symptoms the most common include: pain when urinating (peeing) discharge from the tip of the penis (this can be a white cloudy or watery discharge) pain in the testicles some men have mild symptoms that disappear after two or three days. even if the symptoms disappear you will still have the infection and be able to pass it on. if chlamydia is left untreated in men they are at risk of complications of chlamydeous such as orchitis (swollen testicles) reactive arthritis and infertility. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: diarrhea and stomach pain. i've been having diarrhea for 6 days. anything i take into my stomach will have to come out within 10-15 min but it will come out only a little at a time and have very bad stomach pain while using the bathroom. i would have to wake up 5-6 times at night to use the bathroom but only little at a time comes out. my stomach seem to hurt more if i lay down and also feeling a lot of back pain. don't have any fever but a little head ahead here and there. is this normal?
Baseline Response: Yes
Answer
Answer

Expected Response: viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year. please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since i have no way of examining you. the most important thing is fluid replacement. you must stay well-hydrated. don't eat very much for a few more days. most of these viral infections resolve in about 7-10 days so hang in there. at least you are not vomiting so be greatful. in my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas. your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined. abdinal painad diahrea

Baseline Response: yes i have been taking the pill for 2 months now and i think it has been working. i just got the morning and i just took the morning. the doctor said that the test showed that i was allergic and that i had no allergies. he said that i would have to take the pill again for any allergies to be ruled out. i am sure i will get the pill back. i have taken the pill and i am confident that i will not have any more allergies.

Question: transvaginal ultrasound done 6 weeks pregnant too early to see anything? . i had a transvaginal ultrasound this morning. according to the first day of my last period (8-12-14) i should be 7 weeks tomorrow. my ob dr performed the test but couldn't find any sign of a baby no heartbeat or fluttering. from what i've been reading the test should take at least 30 minutes. she only spent 5 minutes trying then sent me to get blood work done. she's sending me for additional blood work 48 hours later. i've had 3 successful pregnancies/births. i'm 39-years-old. i'm worried.
Baseline Response: the best way to get an ultrasound is to get a blood test done at the same time as the ultrasound. This is especially important if you are having an ectopic pregnancy (an ectopic uterus).

Expected Response: stressing is the worst thing that you could be doing. you might have your dates wrong or something <positive_smiley> you never know until you wait for the blood test results to come back. good luck mommy

Question: pimple in ear i messed with now my lymph node in my neck below that ear is swollen and hurt what should i do
Baseline Response: I have been having a lot of pain in my ear for the last few days and i feel like I need to stop. I just want to tell you how much I really hate it. I got a pimple on my ear. I feel like a piece of meat and I can't get it to heal. I am in a bad mood and I am really depressed. I can barely stand and it is very painful. I have tried to use the pain relievers but they are so bad. It has not worked. I also have a lot more pain and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to get my doctor to help me. I will try to get a chiropractor to help. I think I need some help to get some help.

Question: does niacin cause cancer? . i have started taking niacin to increase my hdl. for the last 3 months i have taken 400mg a day and had 1 beer a day. both were things i found on several wed sites to increase hdl. most other things listed i was already doing. my hdl was 37 and after 3 months it was 42. i was planning on stopping the beer a day and continuing the niacin to see which was causing the improved results. then a co-worker said he was told niacin can cause cancer.
Baseline Response: niacins do not cause cancer because they are not metabolized by the liver and don't cause any side effects. niacit is metabolized to the liver by the kidneys and the liver is not metabolised by the kidney. nivacin is metabolised to the kidney by the bladder and the bladder is not converted to kidney. the kidney is not "re-absorbed"

Expected Response: most helpful answer no. niacin does not cause cancer.
================================================================================
Question: what is oxy ir?
Baseline Response: It is a chemical compound that binds to one of the four oxygen species in the body. The four oxygen-loving molecules that comprise Oxy-I and Oxy-II are all located on the outer surface of the body, so that when you inhale the air, they can all get in contact with each other. They all are "invisible," so they don't appear to be in a state of intense oxygenation.
The oxy-I molecule is a molecule that attaches to the oxygen atoms. It also has a structure called the "oxy-II" structure. This is the chemical that causes the air molecules to become in contact, and the oxy-II structure is what causes them to become less oxygenated.
So the two oxygen-I molecules are in contact.
Oxy-II is an atom that binds with the oxygen molecules. Oxy-III is an oxygen-containing molecule that binds oxygen molecules to oxygen atoms (

Expected Response: this is a good question that you can ask your pharmacist. oxy ir is a medication that contains oxycodone that is used to treat moderate to severe pain. the ir stands for "immediate release. "

Question: what are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?
Baseline Response: hypothyroxine deficiency is a type of hypogonadism. Hypogonads are the most common type of thyroid dysfunction. It can be a sign of thyroid gland damage. Hypothyroidists are often referred to as "hyperthyroidism," and are often thought to have a genetic predisposition to hypothyrophy.
What is hypothyronadism? Hypothyronads are small, irregular, and irregularly colored follicles that are found in the thyroid gland. They are usually located in the mid to late stages of the menstrual cycle. They usually have a few small spots on the underside of the thyroid that are very small and almost invisible.
Hypothyroidis is a condition that can occur when the body is unable to produce enough thyroid hormones to produce proper thyroid hormones. The most common symptoms of this condition are:
A low level of blood sugar

An overactive

Expected Response: features of hypothyroidism can go unsuspected for a long period of time. these symptoms include: fatigue. lethargy. mental impairment. depression. cold intolerance. hoarseness. dry skin. weight gain. change in menstrual cycles. constipation. headaches.
================================================================================
Question: is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis?
Baseline Response: Yes, a circumcised penis is a circumcised man's penis.
The difference in the sensitivity between circumcised and uncircumcised men is in the amount of blood circulating in the penis. Circumcised people are more sensitive to blood, which is what makes them more sensitive in general to pain and pain in the genital area.
Why is this important? Because the foreskin of a circumcised person is so sensitive. When a man is circumcised, he is circumcised by a special surgery called a "rectal circumcision". The foreskin is very sensitive to the blood that flows into his penis. When the blood in the foreskin is so deep that it can no longer pass through the penis, the skin is cut off. The skin is then removed and the skin can no more pass through. The foreskin's sensitivity to the skin in the male is called the "bilateral foreskin". It is the only part of

Expected Response: that’s a controversy. i have many patients including physicians as adults who’ve been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they’re hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it’s almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off. some men will tell you that they don’t feel any more or less after the circumcision. some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that don’t like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it’s social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place. there are risks to the surgery. in good hands those risks are minimal but they can’t be eliminated. so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides. usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact. luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling. you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well. great product. hope this helps.

Question: what is pancreas divisum?
Baseline Response: The pancrease is the membrane between the cell and the surface of the pancrea. This membrane is the place where the cells divide, and where the proteins and enzymes that make up the pancrache divide. When the pancrase is divided, it is divided by the membrane and is not divided by a cell. The pancracyte is the cell's outer layer that contains the proteins that make the cell membrane. The outer layer is called the pancricate, and the pancratis is the inner layer that has the cell membranes.
What is the difference between pancreate and pancratic cell membrane?
What are the differences between pancrate and pancreatic cell membrane, and why is it called pancreatic cell?
The pancreation is the part of the body that is responsible for producing insulin. The body is the most important part of our body because it contains the pancry

Expected Response: pancreas divisum is a common congenital anomaly (an anomaly that is present at birth) of the pancreatic duct(s). the pancreas is a deep-seated organ located behind the stomach. one of its functions is to produce enzymes that are important for the digestion of food in the intestine. the digestive enzymes in the form of digestive juice drain from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct into the duodenum (the upper portion of the small intestine) where they aid in digesting food.

Question: my son was bitten by a spider and now it is red and swollen but doesn't hurt him. what should i do? . the swolleness is the size of an orange but does not hurt him. he doesn't have hives or fever. should i take him to see his pediatrician?
Baseline Response: my daughter is allergic to snakes. she has a small bite from her snake bite. she is allergic and I am not sure if she is also allergic to spiders or if she can be treated with anti-venom. I would advise against taking her to see a pediatrician but I think she could be treated.
Answer to

Expected Response: not knowing the type of spider (venomous or not) or the age/wieght of your son . i would advise you to seek medical care. an area of swelling the "size of an orange" is very concerning.

Question: how should my 15-year-old son (5'11" 220 lbs) be eating particularly before his football games and lacrosse games?
Baseline Response: His parents had the idea to make him eat his diet.
The next morning, my son went to the gym and was eating. He had a few crickets and was very excited about it. He was also very good at reading and writing. He's also very fast and has a very good memory. He also likes to eat.
My son was also extremely interested in lacrosse, so he wanted to get into it.
I think his mom was a big influence on his football development. She always made sure that he was fed the right food. I think that's what the mom had in mind.
During my time with my son, I noticed that he ate more and more of what his mom had recommended.
He likes to read and write and is also very interested in sports.
One of the

Expected Response: overall weight will depend on his position on the field. if he has hoped to be on the o-line then he may be small. if he is a quarterback he may be perfect. overall he needs an adequate balance of protein carbs and fat in his diet. carb-loading i typically reserve more for the endurance athletes but keeping properly fueled up is very important. i think in the end good common sense is key. he is a big kid and obviously very active. he needs to eat a lot to keep up and this should be a well-balanced diet. he should also be very aware of keeping well-hydrated but not just water-loading the day of a game. i am sure there are college demographics for typical size for each position on the field but at 15 the most important factor is enough of all of the vitamins minerals and protein that his body requires to stay healthy and fit

Question: severe itching/numbness over right side of body. any advice? . i am a diabetic and hypertensive. i first noticed the itching about a week ago and the numbness came a few days later. it was localized to the right side of my upper abdomen but has since gotten worse. i now have the numbness down my right leg and feels like a band is getting tighter going from the mid line across the right side of my body around to my spine. just wanting to know my next step.
Baseline Response: I am very allergic to peanuts and have been getting very sick of them for about 6 months now. I am trying to prevent this from happening to others, but it's not working.
The symptoms are a combination of:
-Very high blood pressure
-Shortness of breath
-Low blood sugar
-Feeling like you are not breathing properly
-Nausea
-Chest pain
-Thyroid problems
-Fatigue

Expected Response: the duration progression and distribution of the symptoms makes me think of zoster as a possibility. the painful rash of zoster usually starts after localized symptoms of pain tingling or itching. typically this is seen on one side of the body. a painful rash follows and it resolves within a 2-4 week period if no complications occur. its probably best to see your healthcare provider to get checked and appropriately diagnosed. treatments for zoster can shorten the duration and severity of the illness but treatments needs to be started as soon as the rash appears. nerve damage or neorapthy but sounds like nerve damage for sure have u been n any accidents or anything at home or work it sound like kidney damage.

Question: do anti-snoring chin straps work? are they safe? if they hold your mouth closed will you wake if you stop breathing?
Baseline Response: yes. if you are breathing, your lungs are closed.
Do you use a chin strap to keep your mouth open or open?
Do any of the following things happen?
1. your mouth gets wet, your lips get wet, and your nose gets wet.
2. your lips can't get wet. 2. your tongue can't move. 3. your throat can't reach your throat.
4. your jaw can't close.
5. your chest can't open.
6. your face can't be open. 7. your eyelids can't touch your eyelid.
8. your eyes can't see.
9. your nose can't smell. 10. your hands can't hold your hand.
11. your hair can't stick out.
12. your eyebrows can't

Expected Response: you can try it but there are so many underlying factors that cause snoring that it would be best to see your medical provider or an ent first to see if you have a correctable condition. there are chin straps. nose expanders. special pillows. dental appliances. t-shirts with tennis balls sewed in the back. vitamin/mineral/herbal concoctions. that all claim to cure snoring so don't get caught up with false promises. as long as you can have a money-back guarantee (and they actually refund you money) you can try the chin straps. personally. knowing the anatomy quite well. i don't think a strap will be your answer.

Question: what are the symptoms of hepatitis?
Baseline Response: it's very bad. You have to get a lot of treatment to get it to go away, and then you get it back and you get a virus. You can't stop it, and it's pretty bad.
There are some things that you can do, but you can't really stop it.

Expected Response: the most common symptoms of hepatitis include: dark urine (hepatitis a b c) stomach pain (hepatitis a b c) yellow skin or eye whites (hepatitis a b c) pale or clay-colored stool (hepatitis a b c) low-grade fever (hepatitis a b c) loss of appetite (hepatitis a b c) fatigue (hepatitis a b c) feeling sick to the stomach (hepatitis a b c) lack of nutrition (hepatitis a b c) aching joints (hepatitis b) if you have any or a combination of these symptoms contact your health care provider as soon as possible.

Question: i have pcos. why do i gain weight if i'm active and eat well? can i get back to the way i was last year (100 lbs less)? . i used to be a model. very healthly and very active. i went on the birth control pill for a couple of weeks but they made me very sick so i went off of them. that is when this all started. i have always been very active and very healthy. now i'm losing all of my hair; very seldom do i menstrate; i have excessive body hair growth; i gained about 100 pounds; and i have many more symptoms. i have been tossed back and fourth between doctors and noone helps me: they just brush me off on to others.
Baseline Response: you must be a big man to get off a pill.

Expected Response: pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so it’s important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? what’s a reasonable calorie restriction for you? what’s your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps. <link> i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are "out of whack. " birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle (though not all of the time). i would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologist(sp? ).

Question: why do i see symlin leaking from my needle after i inject?
Baseline Response: because i inject it first, and then inject it again. This can be fixed with some minor modifications.
I've tried to find the cause of symlin leak but the answer is probably not found. If you can't find it, please check the thread on this thread.

Expected Response: you may see one or two drops; this is normal. if you see more than two drops: --you may not have received your full dose. -- do not inject another dose. --talk to your healthcare provider. to prevent dripping or leaking be sure to firmly push and hold the knob with your thumb for 10 seconds before removing needle from skin.

Baseline Response: i am not sure what you mean by that but i would like to see if you can help me to get this procedure done.
If you have any questions please leave a comment below!

Expected Response: you can do it. you just need to address this with your doctor. it is your choice at age thirty and with two (almost) children. this is not a decision that should be made lightly. if your husband is not willing to cooperate (he can get a less-riskier vasectomy! ) then you have to make the decision. you can get an iud or progesterone implant and delay this decision for several years or you can both agree that a tubal ligation is your best choice.

Question: frequent medication for urinary tract infections leads to cancer?
Baseline Response: a. This is true for bladder cancer, but not for urinary bladder cancer.
b. The question is whether this disease is common among people who have a urinary tract infection.
c. The answer is no.
d. This disease is not common in people who do not have a bladder cancer and have had a urinary bladder infection. The disease is called urinary tract carcinoma (URCT).
e. This disorder is common in many people who develop this disease and have been exposed to this disease.
f. This diagnosis is not universal and is often made based on medical history.
g. This condition is rare in people with a urinary urticaria.
j. This problem is not uncommon in people exposed to urinary tract cancers. The problem is that people with these cancers often have other problems, such as thyroid disease. This may be a sign that the person is not well-informed on this

Expected Response: most of the medications used for urinary tract infections are commonly-used antibiotics or medications used to control symptoms. they do not cause cancer.

Question: why do i feel lightheaded fatigued and sweat during sleeping (no fever)? . i am an almost 37 yr old female with a lot of stress right now. dr. put me on effexor and i started not being able to sleep having bad headaches feeling lightheaded and constipated. i took it for 2 weeks and he told me to stop when i called him. he called me in something else but i'm afraid to get it. i've been on paxil prozac and celexa and never felt this horrible. i haven't taken anything in almost a week but feel lightheaded many times thoughout the day. any ideas what could be wrong?
Baseline Response: i have been using paxillium for about 6 months and i'm still not sure if it's a good or bad thing. i think it's just my body being too tired to get anything done. i feel like i'm in a fog. i don't know if i'm

Expected Response: thanks! actually i had some bloodwork done and my vitamin d level was very low (7). i was put on 50 000 iu of a prescription vitamin d for 8 wks (1 a wk). it's been 9 weeks tomorrow and now i'm taking over the counter vitamin d am going back to dr next week to have blood checked again. i felt better after the first 2 wks not dizzy not tired no more headaches. then again i began feeling dizzy lightheaded alot and tired no energy. i don't know what's going on; but i'll hopefully find out. <positive_smiley>

Expected Response: no. i think the baby will be absolutely thrilled that you have stopped smoking.
================================================================================
Question: can blood thinners cause cancer. can blood clots and medications for blood clots cause cancer.
Baseline Response: yes, blood thinning is a risk factor for cancer. Your doctor should talk to you about it.
There are two main types of cancer: breast, prostate, lung, and prostate cancer. They are often the same type.
How do I know if I'm a risk?
You can't know if you're a risk if you have a blood thinner. There are no tests to determine if you are a risk.
What is a blood clot?
A blood clotted blood clot is a small piece of tissue that is attached to a clot. A blood clout is a piece of blood that has been injected into the blood stream.
The blood clouted blood may not show up on your blood test or in your doctor's report.
If you have any questions about blood clouts, visit your doctor or visit a local cancer center

Expected Response: there has been no association between the use of blood thinners (there are many different types) and any type of cancer. products that cause cancer would not have been approved by the fda.

Question: can i give my 3 year old daughter childrens claritin and a decongestion med within 24 hours of each other? . the decongestion medicine in a prescription medicine that was given to her for congestion problems in the past. but i'm not sure if her stuffy nose and cough is now from pollen and seasonal allergies
Baseline Response: no.

Expected Response: decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separately. as long as the dosgages are appropriate. newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the child's medical provider. decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds; and do not help children with allergies. antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the "okay" from your child's pediatrician because of the age.
================================================================================
Question: does an amoxicillin allergy mean i can't take oxacillin? . can i take oxacillin with an amoxicillin allergy even though i took penicillin throughout my childhood without any problems?
Baseline Response: yes, an amoxillin allergy means i can take oxecillin with a amoxicin allergy even if i didn't take penicillins.

Expected Response: if you are allergic to amoxicillin you should avoid all drugs in the penicillin class. this would include oxacillin. it is entirely possible to have taken a penicillin in childhood without any adverse reaction and then develop an allergy later in life. that's because allergies develop upon repeated exposure to an allergen. in other words almost no one is allergic to penicillin the first time they're exposed. most people exhibit an allergic reaction on some subsequent exposure. you should be sure to note your penicillin allergy on your medical record. a severe allergic reaction to penicillin can result in death. for most needs there are other antibiotics that can be used in place of a penicillin. wishing you well!

Question: can dads suffer from postpartum depression?
Baseline Response: no.
Answer #2: It is possible to have postpartal depression.

Expected Response: postpartum depression has received more attention in recent years. but most of it has focused on moms. a new study published in jama found some interesting results: about 10% of dads suffer from postpartum depression too. yes 1 in 10 dads become seriously depressed between their partners’ first trimester and in the first year (usually the first three to six months) of their child’s life. and men are more likely to be depressed when their partners are depressed. as you might imagine it’s difficult to provide a nurturing environment for a baby when both parents are feeling down. this is a real issue for new parents to be aware of.

Question: can i still get hepatitis b through sexual transmission if i have already been fully vaccinated?
Baseline Response: yes, in that case, you can get hepatitis B through the use of a sexually transmitted disease vaccine. However, if you are already vaccinated and have already received a hepatitis B vaccine, you must still get Hep B through sexual or other means.
1. How can I get hepatitis C through transmission of hepatitis B?
1) The following are some ways to get hepatitis A through vaccination:
1.) Hepatitis B is not a disease.
2.) Hepatocellular infection (HBC) is not an infection.
3.) Hepatic infection (HPV) is an infection of the liver.
4.) Hepaemic hepatitis is not the same as hepatitis B.
5.) Hepaluria is not hepatitis B, but HepB-positive.
6.) Heparemia is not HepB, but HBC-positive, or the same in

Expected Response: most helpful answer if your vaccination was successful then you will be protected against getting hepatitis b through sexual contact. not all vaccinations "take" so the only way to be sure is to have your medical provider order a test to prove that your hepatitis b antibodies are high and protective. remember that hepatitis b is not the only disease that can be contracted sexually. practice safe sex always.

Question: will/can the popular "egg" vibrators damage the uterus? . the "egg" vibrator is inserted in the vagina.
Baseline Response: yes, it is important to note that the "cups" are not the same thing. They are not "cubes" and do not have the same vibrations. The "eggs" do not vibrate and the "vaginas" do.
The "egg vibrator" is inserted into the vagina and is inserted by the uterus. The uterus acts as a "gut" for the "pill" of the "pills". The "pill", like the "cup" or the "mouth", acts as an internal organ to the uterus, which acts as the "gastric" for her.
So the "cock" of "cuckold" does not vibrator the uterus but the "duck" does.
And the "fetus" does!
Answer
The uterus acts like a

Expected Response: most helpful answer probably not but no one has really tested this in a clinical study. hi see above answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on webmd. hi i think your find like most things if you don't over use it your be ok there is not much info relaying to the egg but if this is a battery operated on just try the older ones the rely on just rubbing together this cause's a vibration the stops till you hit another bump. so next time you see a woman with a silly grin you now know why. good luck

Question: what are pregnacy chances after a tubaligation? . i had my tubes tied after i had my son 4 yrs ago. i am 27 yrs old and i believe i'm showing signs of early pregnancy.
Baseline Response: I've seen a number of studies that show a good prognosis for a tubally-sexy pregnancy after a baby has been born. The only thing I would recommend is to get the first trimester tubes removed before you start taking your first trimesters.

Expected Response: it would be highly unlikely for you to be pregnant after having a tubal ligation. surgeons are very careful to make sure those fallopian tubes are cut cauterized and separated. there have been a few cases where the tubal was blotched but before thinking you are pregnant see you medical provider for a very accurate pregnancy test and careful examination. there are many things that can mimic a falser pregnancy so get it checked out. i know that it's highly unlikey but my aunt got her tubes tied after she had my cousin and 2 years later she got pregnant with her last one. so it is possible but it can happen

Question: i have had a left knee replacement using the zimmer flex lps and i have had nothing but pain in the knee and outside . the ortho said there is nothing wrong when he looked at my xray and said i should go for a second opinion. this replacement was done 6mo ago dec 6th. when going to the site for the brand of knee it has numerous issues posted by other patients. any other input would be appreciated.
Baseline Response: I have had the zips of the knee replaced by a left one. My knee is very much on its way to full size. I have never had any problems with this replacement. I am still working on a second knee replacement.

Expected Response: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it must be frustrating to go through a major surgery and then continue to experience pain issues. if your orthopedic surgeon suggested you get a second opinion i'd advise you to do just that. it's possible a different surgeon with different experience in joint replacement will be able to identify the source of your pain and treat it. a number of conditions could cause the pain you describe. if you have a fever (101f) nausea or feeling like you might be coming down with the flu i'd suggest you call your orthopedist as soon as possible as these may be signs of an infection. otherwise i'd suggest you get that second opinion. i hope you find relief soon!

Question: asthma. i was to be treated for asthma when i was younger for maybe a year. now i am 21 and have recently been having trouble breathing when walking across campus or up stairs. i am not overweight. i have been smoking cigarettes occasionally though. could this be bringing back the symptoms of asthma?
Baseline Response: -It is.

Expected Response: smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect asthma. if you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this; 1. put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes (i. e. stepping out of a warm car into cold air. ) 2. start deep breathing exercises. my doctor had me start with just ten a day. he said to find a quiet relaxing place where i can time my breaths. breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you can't. do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath. each night try holding it a little longer. you will be amazed how well this will help 3. check with a doctor. your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath. you may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes. 4. ask ten smokers over 40 when they started and why. also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same. both my kids tried smoking in college. after doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive. good luck! and use your head!

Question: is a vaginal yeast infection bacterial or viral? . also what is the normal span of a yeast infection (if in the process of being treated with medicines and ointments)?
Baseline Response: yes, it is a bacterial infection.
Answer #2: if you are an infected person, how does your vagina heal?
Answer 1: a vaginal infection is a viral infection. This is a very common condition.
If you are in a very small size, you might be a good candidate for a vaginal hysterectomy.

Expected Response: neither. a bacteria is a bacteria. a virus is a virus. vaginal yeast is a yeast (fungus). the duration of treatment as well as the success of your treatment depends on what you are using and how well your body responds to that particular treatment. assuming you were accurately diagnosed and properly treated most women are better in less than a week.

Question: how long should a parent brush or help brush a child's teeth?
Baseline Response: A parent is responsible for ensuring that their child does not have a toothbrush, so long as they are in good physical health. A parent should also be able to give his or her child a tooth brush.

Expected Response: it takes many years before children develop the fine motor coordination they need to do a good tooth brushing job. some dentists advise that parents brush their children's teeth until the child can neatly write his or her own name. other dentists suggest parents use their own judgment but to consider between ages 6 and 8 as the time for kids to take on the job of keeping their teeth clean and healthy. general rule: a smear or pea sized drop of fluoridated toothpaste can be used when the child can spit effectively.

Question: do hernias usually develop on both sides of the body?
Baseline Response: the body usually develops from the same place. Sometimes the body can develop from the left side of the head, sometimes from the right side, sometimes it can develop into the right.
If you have a question about the position of the skin, it is important to ask hernia before doing anything.
For example, when you are doing a physical examination, you will usually ask hernia.
When shenia is developed, it can be difficult to understand what is going on.
Do you have questions about hernia?
If she is not in pain, she might not be able to move.
What about the skin that is not developed?
There is no problem with the skin.
How long can she remain in the skin?
She might be able for a few days.
You might have a lot of time to prepare the skin for the examination.
It is

Expected Response: groin hernias are somewhat more likely to develop on both sides. this is probably because the structural elements develop symmetrically and the stresses on the body that occur over time are similar on both sides. when a patient becomes aware of a groin swelling on one side examination by a doctor will often identify a small hernia on the opposite side.

Question: how do i keep from waking up hungry? . i usually eat dinner between 6 and 8 at night but i'm always ravenously hungry when i wake up (between 5-6 on weekdays and 7-8 on weekends). sometimes i even wake up and struggle to get back to sleep due to hunger. i eat protein with every meal and eat several small meals a day the largest always being dinner in hopes of not waking up hungry. it's not a thyroid problem i've had that tested twice in the past 2 years and i'm 30 pounds overweight (failing to lose weight for 3 years now).
Baseline Response: The problem with this diet is that it's only one thing. You have to eat the right amount of protein, and eat it at the right time. If you're getting the right kind of protein and not getting it from a protein source, then you're not going to have a good time. I'm sure you've noticed that your body is getting used

Expected Response: in some cases waking up hungry would not be a problem but it sounds like it is affecting your quality of life. in addition to your protein source at dinner try including a big salad and/or soup whole grains and some healthy fat (olive oil avocado etc. ). eating from all the food groups helps increase feelings of fullness. you can also try a bedtime snack of something light like fruit with peanut butter or whole grain crackers and cheese. if you are staying up late this can increase hunger so getting to sleep early can help. you also want to make sure you get enough to eat earlier in the day including a good breakfast and lunch with in between healthy snacks. also make sure you are hydrated so that isn't being confused with hunger. for more tips on managing your hunger see this article. good luck!

Question: i am 76 and my husband is 73. we have medicare and a supplementary aetna through my former employer. will we be able to keep this same health insurance?
Baseline Response: Yes. We will be able, as long as we have our medical insurance, to keep our health insurance.
I have been told that the government has taken a stance that we should not have to pay for our own healthcare.
Do you think that the situation is in line with your views?
I think that it is a matter of principle.
If the government says, "We are going to pay the full amount that we are entitled to, we should be able and able to do that", then what does that mean?
People may not know that.
But what is the case of a couple who are entitled by the state to their own healthcare?
That is a big issue.
There is no question that the state has taken an interest in this issue. So,

Question: what should i eat during a flare-up of ulcerative colitis symptoms?
Baseline Response: a flare up of ulcers is a serious condition where you may experience pain or discomfort during the day. There are several ways to respond to a flareup of symptoms and if you have symptoms, you may need to seek medical attention.
In general, you should seek medical help to resolve symptoms. It's important that you understand what you're experiencing and do not have any symptoms. If you do have symptoms you can talk to your doctor about how to respond.
It is important to note that there are many different ways to treat ulceration.
Treatment Options
The best treatment options are to use medications or fluids to reduce the risk of ulitis. You may also take anti-inflammatory medications to help relieve pain.
If you have any other health issues, you can ask your doctor or your doctor's referral doctor for a referral to a healthcare provider. If your symptoms

Expected Response: during a flare-up the large intestines become inflamed causing diarrhea and discomfort. many experts recommend going on a non-residue diet -- one that eliminates foods that are difficult to digest or that contain indigestible fiber. that means avoiding fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds and whole grains. some doctors recommend a liquid diet during severe flare-ups. with no food passing through the large intestines the bowels have time to heal. a low-residue diet is also recommended for people who have developed a narrowing of the lower small intestine called the ileum. keep in mind that no two people respond the same way. "some patients do well on a low-fiber low-residue diet but every patient is different " says david t. rubin md co-director of the inflammatory bowel disease center at the university of chicago.

Question: can antidepressants cause weight gain?
Baseline Response: no. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that antidepressants cause any weight gain.
In fact, the opposite is true. The majority of studies on antidepressant treatment have been done on people who have been treated with an antidepressant.
The study from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst found that antidepressants had no effect on weight gain in people who had been treated for depression, but had no side effects.
Of the 28 studies, only one had a negative effect on depression, and only one showed a benefit.
Why is this?
Because antidepressants are known to have a strong anti-inflammatory effect.
Studies of antidepressants have shown that they have a mild effect on fat loss.
What are the side effects of antidepressants?
There are a number of side effects that are common to all antidepressants.
It is important to note that there is some evidence that antidepressants do have some side effects, but the exact mechanism is still

Expected Response: most of the antidepressants and probably all of the mood stabilizer[s] can and do cause weight gain. bupropion -- commonly known as aplenzin wellbutrin or zyban -- usually does suppress appetite and can result in less weight gain than other antidepressants. within each family or class of meds there are some that are more weight-gain prone and others that are a bit more friendly. ask your doctor specifically about the more weight-friendly ones. also be careful in that weight gain may lead to diabetes and cholesterol problems. if you have gained ask your doctor to check on these and blood pressure too.

Question: high blood pressure trying to regulate it with beta blockers what should blood pressure be to use viagra? . if a man has high blood pressure and his doctor is trying to regulate it with beta blockers (which are causing ed like symptoms) what should his blood pressure be in order for him to safely use viagra?
Baseline Response: not to be confused with an increase in blood pressure. The risk of hypertension is much higher for men who have high blood pressures.
Here is an example of the risk of high blood cholesterol:
The risk of heart attack is about 1.2 times higher for a man who has a high blood sugar (like me).
Here's an example for a woman who has high cholesterol:

Here is a chart showing the risk to be higher for women who have a high cholesterol (like my husband).
The more blood cholesterol, the more risk of coronary artery disease. The more blood that can be found in the arteries, the less risk of atheros

Expected Response: abnormalities in blood pressure often relate to the diet and the body's ability (or inability) to absorb nutrients from food. to deal with that problem i suggest you read about the gaps diet and dr natasha mcbride. there's a powerful interview with dr mercola here: <link> as for your erectile dysfunction problem it is common to lose your erection at times - especially under stress. the fastest way to lose an erection is to start worrying about your penis and how long you are going to last. allow yourself to enjoy the feelings in your penis as you squeeze it at the base. this is the natural way to attain an erection. then focus on how arousing your woman is and how much she turns you on. if you are not attracted to your woman a different focusing strategy is required.

Baseline Response: no. the discharge is caused by an infection of the spirochete and the bacteria is spread by coughing or sneezing.
Answer to question: yes. the bacteria cause the discharge and do not cause any other symptoms.

Expected Response: hi no its not normal a discharge should be just white going to yellowish through you cycle you have not said how long its been going on? just a quick thought lost a tampon? i think you should see your gyno for help. see what they say to your problem. hope this helps you. good luck

Question: how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .
Baseline Response: the blood pressure in my heart has dropped so much that i have no control over it. i do try to take it once a week but it is not working. if i get too much of it i will not stop taking it.


Answer 2: i don't have any problems with simvacol or any other medication. i am not in a position to know how to stop taking any medication, but i have taken

Expected Response: after an operation cardiologist and my doctor decided to put me under statines and cardioaspirine and i followed their prescriptions for one year since i noticed that i have muscular problems and strange troubles when i streched them. one time i had to stay in bed for 3 days without force like if it was a serious atack of flue. after i read that this was a side effect of statines i decided to stop and to change my life. one year after and 10kg less i just pass an exam and the cardiologist says to me that everything is perfect cholesterol is under the limit cardiogram and an effort test have been without any problem. the doctor says to me to continue absolutely with statines and cardioaspirine as i didn't say to him that i stop to take them since one year for me is a good sign. the results are obtained like this: with exercice and with a strict dieta. every morning from 7 to 9 i do exercices in a fitness center. one part with a group one part alone with all the machines. in one year i frequently arrive to make exercices that many young people can't and i'm like an exemple for that center as i am 70 years old. i only take a rest one time a week. about dieta i avoid all industrial food like cakes or pastries but also bread rice potatoes pastas and pizzas (especially in the evening) i only eat meat one time a week (frequently chicken with a glass of wine) the other days only fish and 4 o 5 different vegetables cooked in the oven. two to 4 meals a week with nuts and seeds of any kind. (15 different sorts in a very small quantity as together it can be 150 grams). i was never feeling so well and i'm still actifve in my company. frankly statines are the contrary of what we need as they provoke muscular problems and other different sicknesses and this can impeach you to make the exercice that you need. it's really a non-sense medication! you are becoming impotent and more sick instead of beeing better. when i heard that actually there is a campaign among doctors and medias to prescribe statines even for chieldren it's really like a crime. the level of cholesterol has been invented by doctors payed by the producers of statines and not by indipendent doctors. remember.

Question: can b 12 cause leg cramps? . since my husband started taking b 12 he has been getting severe leg cramps
Baseline Response: b 12 can cause leg pain.
Answer to question: can a b 12 be the cause of leg cramping?
Answer : b 12 cannot cause leg pains.

Expected Response: i don't know why your husband it getting leg cramps. there can be dozens of reasons but i can tell you that vitamin b12 doesn't cause them. he will need to discuss this issue with his medical provider to determine a cause. and a solution. remember that men can be stubborn about getting medical care so your encouragement is very important. i can't speak to the science or the research but i did not have leg cramp problems until i started taking b-12. i stopped taking it and have not had any leg cramp problems since. your husband is not alone in having a similar experience.

Question: i'm 34 have hot flashes night sweats high fsh levels and no period for two months. do i have ovarian failure? . after a progesterone withdrawal test my period started in two days.
Baseline Response: my ovaries started to get more sensitive. I was feeling very sick. I did not know what was wrong until i went to the doctor and the doctors told me to take a pill. I took the pill and I went into a coma. I went to a doctor and he told me that my ovary would not be functioning. I thought, that's what it is. Then he told my family and I told them about it. They asked me if I had ovary issues. I told him that I had ovarian issues. He said, you know what? I said, I'm not going to lie to you. I've got a beautiful baby. I'm 24 months old. I got the progesterones and I'm in remission. I don't have

Expected Response: what the progesterone withdrawal tells you is that there is definitely some stimulation of the lining of the uterus by estrogen -- estrogen can come from the ovary and it also can be made in other parts of the body too. if the fsh is high it does mean that most likely you are heading toward menopause. the major question i would ask you is "are you hoping to have children beyond this point? " if you are i would encourage you to consult with a gynecologist who specializes in what is called reproductive endocrinology as soon as you can. (the american society of reproductive medicine or asrm could help you find someone near you if you don't know of anyone locally). if you are not planning for children at this point there is no race toward intervention. if you are indeed heading toward menopause and are having symptoms you would be a good candidate for a low-dose birth control pill that would take care of your symptoms well. as i have mentioned before for women who do experience premature ovarian failure taking hormones is usually a good idea -- so do not be afraid of hormonal intervention.

Question: what is the difference between lovaza and the otc fish oil products?
Baseline Response: otc is very similar in quality to lovaza.
There is no difference in flavor.
I would like to say that you can order lovaza for the same price as lovaza, but you can only order lovazos from otc.
How much is the price for lovaza?
The price is 2.5 times the price of the same lovaza in the same bottle.
What is the Difference between OTC and lovaza
There are no differences in flavor between lovazo and lovaz.
For the same amount of money you could buy lovaz, or for the exact same amount you could not buy lovaza at the same time.
Why is it important to understand the difference?
We need to know that the difference in taste is not a matter of taste but of taste.
We know that lovaza is very different from oc fish

Expected Response: and one that i have to answer a lot because many people don't know that they really need to get the prescription filled! the fda-approved dose of lovaza is four capsules per day. it could take up to 14 capsules per day of an omega-3 supplement to provide the same amount of active ingredients proven to lower very high triglycerides. omega-3 dietary supplements have not been approved by the fda to treat any specific disease like very high triglycerides. supplements also do not go through an fda approved manufacturing process. if you have any other questions talk to your pharmacist it’s worth the extra time.

Question: does crixivan cure human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids)?
Baseline Response: the following can be helpful:
1. the virus is present in the gut
2. it is present from birth through to adulthood
3. it may be present in stool
4. it can be present from the environment
5. it has been found in human feces

Expected Response: crixivan is not a cure for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). people taking crixivan may still develop infections or other conditions associated with hiv. because of this it is very important for you to remain under the care of a doctor. although crixivan is not a cure for hiv or aids crixivan can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses associated with hiv. crixivan may not have these effects in all patients.
================================================================================
Question: after a tension headache and sinus infection for several days why have i been confused spacey and forgetful?
Baseline Response: I know that you have many different theories about what happened to me. I have no idea why I did it. I am not sure why I felt the pain. I do not know why I could not be in the right place at the right time. I feel that I am in a good place at a very good time.
I am sure that the stress of being in the wrong place is something that is being used to make you forget the things that you want to forget.
If you think that you are in a bad place, then you will not be able to move forward. You will not move forward in the correct direction.
We are all in a terrible place. It is our fault that we have to do this.
This is what I am trying to do. I want to help you to move in the same direction you are

Expected Response: this type of word-finding problem is pretty common with migraine. tension headache doesn't normally do this (but stress can cause both tension headache and difficult talking). usually talking with a neurologist can sort this out.
================================================================================
Question: does your spouses doctor have to inform you that your spouse has an std other than hiv? . my spouse and i share the same primary care md he knows about my husbands affairs and he's prescribed antibiotics to him more than once.
Baseline Response: yes, my husband has been a doctor for many years, and my wife is a physician. my wife has a doctorate degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and she has a PhD in nursing from the National Institutes of Health. my husband and i are married. my partner and i have three children. my primary care physician has been on the staff of my main care provider for the past 5 years. my main caregiver is my spouse, my son, and our daughter. my spouse has a degree in nursing, and has been in the hospital for over 5 years now. my health insurance policy does not cover my primary medical care.

Expected Response: because of strict hippa privacy rules a medical provider is prohibited by law from revealing any medical information to another person including a wife. just because your husband was prescribed antibiotics in no way implies that he is being treated for an std.

Question: how often should i replace my mascara?
Baseline Response: not often, but it's important to keep your face clean, and not dry.
This is a lot of work to put in for a while, but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
The next time you're looking for a good mascara, make sure you get your new one on before it's too late.
I love using my new mascara, and I have no issues with it. It is a little pricey, but if you're like me, you'll love it!
If you're interested in getting a new mascara that's a little bit longer, check out the review on my friend's blog,  Mascara.com .
If I didn't already know, I'm a mascara girl, so I'm always looking for new mascara products that I can use.
Thanks so much for reading and please share with your friends if you have any questions, comments or anything else

Expected Response: masacara should be kept no longer than three months after opening. after three months bacteria can begin to grow inside the tube; this growth of bacteria can lead to an infection. a strange or foul odor from your tube of mascara is another sign that your tube has expired. if you notice that your mascara appears flakey or is caking up discard of it. you should also replace your mascara if you contract any type of eye infection; such as conjunctivitis (pink eye). this will prevent you from becoming reinfected. it is also not a good to share your mascara with others. if you suspect that you are having a bad reaction after you have applied your mascara please remove the mascara discard of the tube and consult your physician.

Question: what's the difference between the nasal spray and injectable vaccines for flu?
Baseline Response: the nasal sprays contain a substance that is called anaphylactic acid. In the nasal, the acid is a substance known as anaphalene. In injectable, the substance is anaphylethane. The nasal spray contains anaphydactyl, an antifungal, and a fungicide. The injectable vaccine contains an epinephrine, an epiPen, and an anapharin.
In the nasal injections, the drug is an inert substance called epinephedrine. The epinephrine is a form of anaphyses that causes a slight headache. The injected vaccine contains epineptrine. Epineptine is a synthetic chemical compound that is used to kill viruses. Injectable is the most commonly used injectable nasal spray. Injectionable is a high-risk drug that causes respiratory symptoms. Injected is

Expected Response: the traditional flu shot contains proteins separated from the flu virus. those proteins can't cause illness. but your immune system learns to recognize them and mounts a protective reaction if a real live flu virus tries to infect you. the flumist nasal spray works differently. it contains a live flu virus that has been weakened to the point that it can't cause the flu. that sounds pretty scary but millions of people have safely taken this kind of vaccine. the advantage of the nasal spray is that in children who have never had the flu or a flu vaccine before it seems to elicit a stronger immune response than the flu shot.

Question: is it possible for a 9yo girl to start menstruating @ age 9(spotting) then not start again until age 11?
Baseline Response: it's not possible for 5yo girls to have periods at ages 6-10 but 7yo girls can.
Answer, what are the differences in your age?

Expected Response: yes. that is definitely possible. if your nine year old (now 11? ) is showing other signs of maturation (breast formation public hair etc. ) the menses can start at any time. at first the menses may not be consistent or monthly.

Question: which will help arthritis and fibromyalgia the most a hot tub or a sauna
Baseline Response: it is not possible to use hot tubs. Hot tubs are the best option for patients who have arthritis, fibromycosis, and fibrosis.
How to use a hot-tub
A hot tub is a warm-up area that will help you relax and relax. A hot tub has a vacuum that will let you know when you are ready to go. It is usually located at the back of the room. A cold bath can help your muscles relax and keep you warm. You can also use a warm water bath, which is a combination of warm water and a cold bath. You will also need to use an air conditioning system.
What you should know about hot tub use
Hot tub use is very important for patients with arthritis and, if you do not have arthritis or fibromyocytosis, you should not use hot water. Hot water is not

Expected Response: both hot tub and sauna will help easing the pain in arthritis and fibromyalgia. any one chosen should however be used in moderation.
================================================================================
Question: what are hormonal causes for heavy periods?
Baseline Response: The two hormones are hormonal and estrogen. The two most common causes of heavy menstrual periods are:

Oral contraceptives (birth control pills)

Doping (doping has become a top-selling method of birth control).

FDA regulations require that all drugs manufactured or marketed by the FDA be available to women at a minimum of three times a year, which is more than the number of pills per day for women.

The FDA regulations require the manufacturers to provide women with a prescription of at least four pills per month. This includes all the drugs that are sold. This requirement is not necessary for all types of pills.
.



The two most commonly prescribed drugs are:


Prozac (commonly called fluoxetine)
 (common to all other medications)
,

(common to most other medications),

, Prozac (a prescription drug) (common

Expected Response: in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand. this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime (eshre 2007). even the use of most hormonal contraceptives (pill/patch/ring) will yield a monthly bleed. so it’s no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual. to address the most-pressing question “when should i be concerned? what is the medical definition of too much bleeding? ” there is a medical definition of “too-heavy periods. ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc (2. 7 ounces — about 1/3 of a cup) or more that is excessive bleeding. trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom! some general indications of excessive bleeding can include: * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60-90 minutes for several hours. * passage of large clots (quarter-sized or larger). * significant bleeding for more than seven days. probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities. so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations. hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation-associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don’t decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened. prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows. there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth (“adenoma”) or a problem with the hypothalamus. all of the stress-related causes of not ovulating (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc. ) can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus. increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time. there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed. so if you or someone you know have episodes of heavy blood loss rather than a normal period talk to your doctor because there are ways to stop going with the flow.

Question: how do you break a fever in a toddler?
Baseline Response: It's called a fever, and that's the word you use when you say, "It's the fever." I'm not sure what it's called, but I think it's the flu.
So the fever is the fever. It's like, "This is the flu." You're not going to know what it is until you get the flu, and then you're going to have the fever, which is the same thing.
I've had a fever for a year and a half, and I've had it for a month and a quarter. I've got a fever every day, and it's like it's a fever.
It's not a fever that goes away.
In fact, it's not. It just goes away, and you're like, 'I'm not going anywhere.'
I think that it's important to understand that the flu is a disease. The flu is

Expected Response: it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature 98. 6f. it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at 98. 6f. what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of 101 f. but the body is still 98. 6 f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever "breaks"? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to 98. 6f. now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98. 6f. it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever "breaking". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff.

Question: i am 54 (female) and have not excercised in years. is it too late to start and also see results? . is there such a thing as toning flabby areas at my age?
Baseline Response: Yes, this is a common condition and may be a sign of a pre-existing condition. It is not a sign that your foreskin is being pulled. If it is, then your foreskin has been pulled and your foreskin will be dry. If this happens, then you may have a dry glans.
Answer : The condition is mild and usually seen in young people. It has no known cause.

Expected Response: most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking. according to the experts it is never too late to start an exercise program. they have worked with people in nursing homes who were unable to walk and got them walking again! get cleared by your doctor first to make sure you do not have any underlying health problems. start gradually. just walking at first and then you can join a gym and work with a trainer for a while. you will be surprise with the results. it is never too late to start exercising. it is important that you get a professional trainer to guide you in exercising. you can start with something like yoga which will not be too stressful along with brisk walking. once your body adjusts to this routine you can hit the gym for light weights too.

Question: what is the difference between gralise gabapentin and nuerotin gabapentin?
Baseline Response: gabaporentin is a compound of gabacentin and is used as a laxative in the treatment of constipation. It is not the most potent laxative, but it is the most effective. The best-known of the two is gababicin, which is used in the prevention of constipated diarrhea.
Gabapicin is used to relieve constipation, but the benefits of gablapentin are not well understood. It has been found to reduce the risk of diarrhea in patients with type 2 diabetes.
What is the best and worst gablabicins?
The best gablacentin is the bupropion, which acts as a mild laxative. It can be used in combination with gabape, a laxatives, or as a food additive.
The worst gabas is bu

Expected Response: gabapentin is the generic name for a prescription drug used to treat seizures nerve pain and other problems. gabapentin is produced by different manufacturers under various brand names including neurontin gralise fanatrex gabarone neogab and nupentin. all of these medications contain the same active ingredients. the formulation of the non-active ingredients (binders colorings) may be different. however the medications should work exactly the same when you take them. you should not notice any difference between taking gralise and neurontin for example. if you had been taking gralise and suddenly received neurontin when you refilled your prescription you can talk to your pharmacist to find out why. however it shouldn't matter which specific brand name you take. they should work the same for you. hope this helps!

Question: does early mens means early menopause too? . i had my first period when i was 9 years old and since then i have regular menstrual cycle (for five days). usually i experience heavy flow every second day of my period. now that i'm 24 i don't experience heavy flow on my second day anymore and even more surprising to me is that i'm just having spots on my third day. i've noticed this since last year before i used bcp for my acne. i wanted to know if this has something to do with how young i am when i started having my period.
Baseline Response: it is. It is.

Expected Response: hi i think your find there is quite a simple answer to your question. bcp pills do regulate your periods and i think your find that it has done just that and this is why your period s have changed. ok simple answer. good luck

Question: how is copper superior to other antimicrobial surfaces? how is copper superior to other antimicrobial surfaces? . i recently came across a scientific blog which was titled “copper kills 99. 9% of bacteria within two hours! ” well i initially thought it was just a media hype; however with further research it came out to be quite true.
Baseline Response: copper is an antimicrobial surface and copper is not. Copper is not used for a variety of reasons. Firstly it has antibacterial properties and secondly it is highly resistant to all other antimicrobials. Copper has antibacterials, so copper is a good candidate for antimicrobial treatment.
Solution: copper has been used for many years to treat many kinds of bacterial infections. Copper can be used for treating various types of diseases. Copper protects against bacteria from invading bacteria, but also it can be antibacterial for the skin and for the eyes. Copper also has anti-inflammatory properties. Copper's antibacterial activity is

Question: how would an emergency aid physician handle a 100 degree fever in a three year-old. so i'm a novelist trying to figure out a hospital scene in my latest work. my character has just taken her son to the hospital because they both have fevers of over 100 (she is at 100 her three year-old is at 103) and she is basically in a panic. . they both have mono (the mother had it first and transferred it to her son unknowingly) and i've done research to find how a doctor would treat this. what i need to know is how the physician would break the fever. . thank you very much.
Baseline Response: i'm writing about a couple of things in my writing that are interesting and i'm not sure how they would be presented in my story. i am not sure if it's a book or a book-length article, but i'm sure it would be interesting.
I have a friend who has a very high fever and

Expected Response: a few problems with your story. 1. fever is harmless; both the 103 and the 100. it is unlikely that an experienced physician would do anything. fever is more beneficial and does not need to be treated at all. 2. mono is a virus and it is not treatable either

Question: how will i know if my boss gets rid of company insurance because of the affordable care act?
Baseline Response: We will see.
It is a great question.
We have asked our members to submit their comments here.
Please keep an eye on the comments section for the latest updates.
1. What is the plan of insurance company for the average American?
2. What should I expect from my company?
3. What will my benefits look like?
4. How do I know my plan will cover me?
5. What are the benefits of my insurance plan?
6. What insurance do I need to buy?
7. How much will my employer cover my insurance?
8. How will my insurance cost?
9. How should I pay for my insurance premiums?
10. How can I find out if my employer will cover my premiums?

Expected Response: the only real way to know is to ask. however if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law i would be wary of the answer. in fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so. they'll also pay a penalty if at least one full-time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces. today 98% of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94% of businesses with 50 to 199 employees. and they’ve providing insurance long before the aca became law for a host of good reasons the law doesn't change. for one providing insurance is a tax-free form of compensation. and a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees. we have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50-employee threshold – it could certainly raise an employer's costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and don’t offer insurance. and some industries with part-time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week. but for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs. i would need to know more about your particular employer's situation but on the face of it it doesn't seem eliminating insurance if it's already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law. i have been in the health insurance business for 40 years. the aca (obamacare) mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans. this is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance. one wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own. the exchanges are simply private insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace. they are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price. no one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges. some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others. these private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks. it is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business. that having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system. it simply has not worked and i personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future. in fact in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with canadian citizens. i know i know canadians are marching to the us for their health care needs. this post is to short to actually address this issue but suffice to say canadians are not coming in any great numbers to the us for their basic health care needs. actually when you factor out tourists from canada who receive emergency treatment the incidence of canadians coming to the us is actually quite small and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in canada for those types of services. take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies. many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend. for your research pleasure i would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future. see the book "the healing of america; a global quest for better cheaper and fairer health care" by t. r. reid. finally yes we have the finest health care system in the world but only if you can afford it. the answer this so called " expert " gave is misleading. the truth is that the aca will cost small businesses more or it will cost tax payers way more. anytime the government says they give subsidies they are talking about using the taxes they collect from you and your boss to pay for it. so it is a pay me now or pay me later thing. this law is not suppose to work. it is designed to crush privately owned insurance and collapse the healthcare system in our country. they want a single payer system. the same one that has failed in every country and in every way. so yes it will cost you more. a lot more and for less coverage. anytime an obama spokesperson talks about how obamacare isn't working they end it with" that's why we need a single payer system". so take what this site says with a grain of salt. they are part of healthcare. gov. this administration in the white house has lied from day one. my daughters employer switched retirees to another plan. even her disability annuity is less. she has just undergone colon surgery and the new plan does not offer her required med supplies nursing home for rehab even her disability annuity is less. read where a lot of corporations have done this - tired of everything being blamed on obama. what are people doing especially thru the surgeries infections wound pumps - when something like this happens i will put it this way. my wife has a heart condition and went without seeing a dr for almost 4 years because we could not afford the insurance. now she has seen her dr and dentist and has not paid a penny more than the premium. we are one of the few 1st world countries without a centralized health care system. the reason for that is because the insurance companies are going to loose a lot of money. aca will work and that scares the pants off the insurance companies.

Question: i was born with one testicle when i did a spermogram i find out that i suffer from hypospermia. is there any cure?
Baseline Response: it is hard to say. I have seen some doctors who say that it is very difficult to cure hypospans. I am sure that it will be more difficult than it seems.
What I would like to ask is if you would like the doctor to give you a blood test to see if you have hyposomia. The doctor should give you this test every 4-6 months.
Why do you think that hyposomas are rare?
I would like you to know that this is not something that we have been able to do because of the lack of funding.
When is the last time you saw a hyposoma?
If the hyposo is not present, it is not necessary to try to treat it.
How do you know if it is hyposor?

Expected Response: obviously there is no cure for a missing testicle. the low sperm count can not be increased but a fertility specialist can collect and spin down several ejaculates if you are planning a pregnancy. your accumulated sperm can then be inserted in your female partner as an artificial insemination.

Question: i have been taking advil for over 3 weeks i want to stop and switch over to plain aspirin. can i do that safely? . i heard that you cannot just stop taking advil. i have been taking 2 twice a day for back pain.
Baseline Response: I am taking advitool for back problems. i had to try and stop taking it because i was having back pain for a month. i thought that if i take advitil, i will not have back pain anymore. i am now taking adval for back issues.
Solution: i am going to go to the doctor and ask him for my adval.
i am taking 2 daily adval every day. i will take adval 2 times a day and i will be able to do that.
I have been using this for a week now and it is making my back pain worse. i can't take advals anymore.
It will be a pain to the head and chest, but

Expected Response: yes. you can just stop taking advil (ibuprofen). there will be no health consequences. why would you want to swtich to plain aspirin? aspirin can have more side-effects than ibuprofen depending on your dose and how you use it so it would be wise to run this by your medical provider -- someon who knos your medical history.

Question: skin rashes no iching or discomfort at all? . a week i noticed i two sets of small red patches on my skin. they are all smaller than the size of a dime. the first set is on my inner forearm which consists of about 10 small circular red patches that run from my wrist to my elbow area. the second set of 4-5 rashes is on my hips right below my right waistline. these bumps are a bit more flaky but fit the same description as above. these rashes do not invoke discomfort at all but they will not go away. i live in a college dorm.
Baseline Response: no.

Question: why do my hands shake involuntarily? it happens when i'm trying to do something precise like pour sugar in my cup. it also happens after i've eaten something so my blood sugar isn't low. and i do drink but i've ruled out delirium tremors. i had eaten something tonight and then when i went to bring my chicken wings to the table i dropped them on the floor. when i had to drive because my gf was too tired my anxiety was through the roof. i feel like my anxiety goes hand in hand with my shaky hands. but i don't know the cause.
Baseline Response: i'm not sure. i don' know if this is related to my stress levels, but i'm still in the early stages of recovery from this. it's hard to explain to people that this is not the case. I've also been told that my anxiety level is higher because I've been told to be careful with my food and not to be too aggressive

Expected Response: this may be an advanced warning sign of parkinson's! if it continues through the next day or so you need to see a doctor. now that i've got you worked up it really might not be that bad. are you getting enough sleep? drinking a lot of coffee? these are the most common causes of shaky hands. lack of sleep may also contribute to anxiety. if this is not the case you may want to evaluate any prescription or recreational drugs that you use. i remember trying an maoi once and my hands got shaky i was sweating like mad and got really anxious. i was even on the lowest prescription dose! many chemicals interact with our nervous system and it all comes down to genetics. you may need to stop drinking entirely to get a full and correct evaluation.

Question: does tt injection needs to be taken once every 6 months or after sustaining cuts with a sharp object? . i sustained a cut on one of my fingers and blood started oozing out immediately. i washed the wound under running tap water and then applied pressure on it using kitchen tissue. after some time the blood stopped and the cut was hardly visible unless you took a closer look. i then cleaned the wound using aftershave lotion and then covered the wound surface with neosporin gel and bandaged it. it happened 2 days from now. do i need to take a tt injection? the last time i took it in mar 2013.
Baseline Response: yes i do. i had a cut in my hand when i was a child and i was told that if i took a tl injection i would get my hand healed but i didnt know what to do about it. i took the tt and i still got my hand to a good level. i did have a

Expected Response: tetanus vaccines are 100% protective against tetanus for ten years. the injection does not protect you against any other wound infection -- just tetanus --- so good first aid after any injury is always necessary. there are much better antiseptics than after shave lotion (alcohol) so perhaps you should improve your home first-aid kit. you can always get wound infections.

Question: what foods should a person avoid if he or she has heartburn gerd or barrett's esophagus?
Baseline Response: a. the best thing to do is to eat only those foods that are safe to eat.
b. for some reason, some foods are not safe to drink.
c. some foods may cause a severe allergic reaction.
d. some people are allergic to certain foods.
e. some food allergies can be treated with a food allergy test.
f. some allergies are not caused by food allergies.
g. if you are allergic, you should always try to avoid all foods. You may be able to get a good result by taking a dietary supplement, but it is a very small dose.
h. some of the foods you should avoid include:
i. green leafy vegetables
j. red cabbage
k. yellow squash
l. green beans
m. chicken thighs
n. peanuts
o. some

Expected Response: eating certain foods including onions peppermint and high-fat foods as well as drinking alcohol can cause the lower esophageal sphincter muscle which controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach to relax. when this muscle fails to close the acid-containing contents of the stomach can travel back up into the esophagus producing heartburn. caffeinated beverages and foods (such as coffee tea colas and chocolate) can also aggravate heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). tomatoes citrus fruits or juices also contribute additional acid that can irritate the esophagus. in addition smoking relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter contributing to heartburn and gerd.
================================================================================
Question: how is ringworm of the scalp or beard treated?
Baseline Response: I have no idea. My opinion is that ringworm is a very rare condition and should be treated with care.

Expected Response: ringworm of the scalp or beard is treated with antifungal pills in combination with antifungal shampoo or lotion. topical antifungal medicines such as shampoos or lotions that you apply directly to the infected area do not work when used alone because they cannot get deep enough into the infected hair shaft to kill fungi there. but antifungal shampoo helps prevent spreading the fungus to other people because it decreases fungal shedding from the scalp or beard area. doctors also recommend occasional use of antifungal shampoos for ringworm carriers people who can spread the fungus but do not have ringworm symptoms. often an adult becomes a carrier after exposure to an infected child. what to think about ringworm of the scalp or beard can come back after treatment has cleared the infection. ringworm of the scalp or beard can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: can i still get pregnant even if i am taking a birth control pill (lactating pill)?
Baseline Response: No.
The pill can be taken in the morning or after a night shift or in the evening. It is best to take it in the afternoon and not in the middle of the night.
This means that you can take it while you are asleep, but you will not be able to give birth.
There are some exceptions to this rule.
You can take a pill after a period of time in order to keep your period. If you are pregnant, this can be done if you have been taking contraception for at least 2 years.
If you are taking contraception because you are worried about your health, you can be allowed to take contraception while you have your period, but not while you want to have it.
I have a problem with my husband getting pregnant and I have to take the pill to prevent him from getting pregnant. What should I do?

Expected Response: milind you really need to go and get you facts right before you answer questions if you bother to read up about the bc pill there is a 1% chance of pregnancy just the same as a 2% chance with condoms not big in both but a real chance and it happens.

Question: pregnant? unprotected sex a week before period. period came on time and heavy with bad cramps as usual. reg 28 day 4 yrs. i had unprotected sex a week before my period started. he ejaculated awa from me but im worried a little bit may have got it before he pulled out. my period came on the dot when it was supposed to get it and was heavy at first then to moderate with bad cramps like i normally have. basically my period came on time and was normal in length flow and cramps. my periods have been regular for years. i do not know when i ovulate or my latueal phase. what are my chances of being pregnant.
Baseline Response: i have a pretty good idea what I'm going to do about it. my best guess is to take my period out of the picture and try to get pregnant by the end of the week. that way i will have no problem with having my period in the week before it is due

Expected Response: if you had your period - you have no reason to worry. plus it's unlikely that you were ovulating at that time (a week before your period is well after when you'd typically ovulate). it's very unlikely that you pregnant.
================================================================================
Question: missed period 3 days after sex? . i've been on the pill for 2 1/2 years and take it correctly. had sex without a condom (he did not pull out) right before my period was due and the period never started. had some very slight light-colored bleeding and some cramps the day it was due (three days after sex) but still no "real" period 3 days later (6 days after sex). pregnant?
Baseline Response: missed periods 3 days before the period was caused. had no bleeding during the period. had the bleeding stopped the day after the period started.
"You're so sick, and you're taking it wrong. I thought you were in a bad mood, but I'm going to stay in bed and wait until I'm in a better mood. You're a nice, healthy person, and I'm glad you're here."
Answer
"I can't wait to see you again. Thank you for being here. I

Expected Response: hi 3 days before your period is not the time to get pregnant now having sex around day 12 now then you would have to worry so think back did you have unprotected sex then by the way day 12 would be 12 days from the beginning of your last period. ok but your on the bc pill yes? did you know that the bc pill is only 99% protective so do you think your in the 1%? it could be that your just having a skipped period it happens but if you doubt this get to your doctor a have a pregnancy test done nothing like being spot on. do hope this helps you. good luck

Question: my 12 yr old brother has not had any vaccinations. how would he go about being immunized now? the immunization schedule. here in alberta begins at 2 months. for whatever reason my parents did not immunize my brother. he frequently gets acute bronchitis (for about a week) and always gets bronchitis when he gets sick. the last time i had taken him in for antibiotics the doctor asked if he had all his vaccinations. i told him that i thought he was up to date with his immunization schedule but later found out he had never been immunized. how would being vaccinated affect my brother frequently having bronchitis?
Baseline Response: my brother is immunized at 3 months and his symptoms are very similar to the ones he had before he was born. his symptoms will be different. he is usually quiet and quiet with little to no talk. he will say "I have no symptoms" and i will say yes to all the questions. he won

Expected Response: in the u. s. the centers for disease control has a "catch-up" vaccination schedule (<link> but i am not sure if canada has a similar resource. i am a huge supporter of vaccines but realistically being vaccinated may not be protective against bronchitis (which is usually viral). influenza and pneumonia vaccines may help him however.

Question: can genital herpes cause chronic insomnia? . i've been so extremely sleepy for the past few years and while i am somewhat stressed i don't think stress can have this much damage in my life. i'm even super sleepy when i don't have school (i. e. summer breaks). i'm pretty sure i have genital herpes based on other symptoms but could this life-crippling insomnia be caused by genital herpes? ! . could treating my genital herpes help my sleep improve (a lot)? . any input would be greatly appreciated!
Baseline Response: you can reduce your sleep by eating a balanced breakfast.
Ask yourself if it's possible to get better sleep when you have sleep apneic episodes. If so,

Expected Response: actually "insomnia" is not the proper word. my trouble is mostly getting a good quality of sleep rather than falling asleep. i don't have too much trouble falling asleep but i don't drift away too easily either. looking back my super-bad quality of sleep started after i received oral sex from someone who had oral herpes! i feel so stupid because it didn't cross my mind that not having symptoms doesn't mean that i can't contract the virus!

Question: who is at risk for psoriatic arthritis?
Baseline Response: It is not possible to determine the cause of psoriatitis because the disease is not transmitted through saliva. Psoriatosis is caused by the presence of bacteria that cause infections.
What is psoriative arthritis? Psoriative arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by inflammation and inflammation of the skin. It is a progressive disease characterized by the onset of inflammation. In psoriatively arthritic patients, the most common symptom is pain. This is usually mild, but sometimes is severe and lasts for months or years.
When psoriatives are first diagnosed, they are often treated with antibiotics. They are often given intravenously, or a combination of antibiotics, in combination with a medication called dronabinol.
The symptoms of psoriasis are similar to those of psomnias, which can be severe. The disease is usually caused by a bacterial infection.
In people with ps

Expected Response: affecting men and women equally about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis may develop at any age but usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50. while the cause is not known genetic factors along with the immune system likely play a role in determining who will develop the disorder. as many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. having a parent with psoriasis triples the chance of getting psoriasis yourself and thus increases the chance of developing psoriatic arthritis.
================================================================================
Question: why shouldnt i combine a multivitamin and a folic acid pill togather
Baseline Response: yes, it's a little difficult to do. I'm not sure why you need to combine it. However, when you combine it with a multichloroquinolones supplement, it can be absorbed into your body. If you do this, you can easily get to a point where you can get all the vitamins and minerals you need.
I am always very cautious about using a multitamins or supplements with vitamins and mineral supplements.
One thing that I don't like about multivitamins and supplements is that they are often made with a combination of a vitamin and a mineral. In my case, I was using the B vitamins and the C vitamins. I would recommend that you take the B and C vitamins, as they are both very important.
For example, the B vitamin is a very important nutrient for heart health, and the B1 and B

Expected Response: you can take them together. keep in mind that most multivitamins have 400 mcg of folic acid already. studies showing a benefit to taking folic acid have generally used the amount in a multivitamin.

Question: am i suffering from anxiety or is it something worse? . 2 months ago i suffered a bad anxiety attack and went to the er and had an ekg chest x-ray mri blood and urine test done and everything was good. ever since i have been getting random mild episodes of anxiety attacks dizziness lightheaded and palpitations. sometimes i cant sleep because i feel something like a brain zap that keeps me up. is there anything to worry about or are these common symptoms of anxiety? . i used to use cocaine a few times/week months ago but i haven't touched that since.
Baseline Response: there is nothing. I feel a lot better when i use cocaine, but it isn't like it's a mental health issue. I still feel like i am having a bad day. I have no idea what is going on, but I can't imagine the rest of the world ever feeling like i'm having a really bad day for having a terrible day.
Question

Expected Response: these are common signs of anxiety and possibly a panic disorder i recommend scheduling an appointment with a therapist or psychistrist to treat the anxiety.

Question: had protected sex and condom broke. im on birth control and got period 2 days later. could i become pregnant? . my boyfriend and i had sex on saturday. he wore a condom and it broke. we didnt realize it was broken until be pulled out before he came. i am on birth control and got my period two days later. is it possible that i can become pregnant?
Baseline Response: yes, you can, but it's not possible. You can't have sex without a condom.
Answer #2: I am on contraception. I got my first pregnancy in the morning. I was on birthcontrol when I was 15. I didn't get pregnant until 2 months later. I have been on birthguard for the last 3 years. I am not sure if it's possible for me to become pregnant, but I don't think it's impossible.
How long have you been on contraception?
How much have you taken?
What do you think about the

Expected Response: i hope by this time you found your awnser but just so the person who awnsered your question knows you can only be 100% safe by staying not haveing sex at all so to enjoy your sexlife with no worry you would want to use multiple conticeptives. i was made when my mom used bc and my dad wore a condom it happens. infact it happend because my mom unknowingly had cervical cancer so her bc did not work.

Question: i want to be ugly. i want some kind of potion that gives me rashes and red spots all over my body for one day. please. i'm not happy looking like a beautiful guy. i want to be ugly and not stand out in the crowd positively. is there something i can take once per day that will give me all kinds of ugliness? . i see people getting rashes from all sorts of places but not on purpose. i don't want to poison myself too much by experimenting so i need help with having a not-too-painful way to do this. please. this is serious.
Baseline Response: i am a very nice girl. i just want to make sure that i don´t become ugly. please help me. i will never be ugly in the long run.

Expected Response: this is a serious response. medical professionals do not provide potents that make people ugly for a day or at least not since the dark ages so you may need to see a theatrical make-up artist.
================================================================================
Question: i want to take nyquil but can i take it if i am taking buproprion?
Baseline Response: Yes, i have taken buproptprion. I have no idea if it is in the bottle, i don't think so. It seems to me that it would be nice to have a more natural approach to the pill. I'm not sure if there is any other way to take it. I think it is best to take a pill in a bottle.
Answer. Yes, I have taken a pill.

Expected Response: never take paxil or prozac and nyquil as these two drugs triple the dose of nyquil in your system and can hurt your heart and you. bupropion only has a mild interaction in a very very small percentage of people and is safe to mix. if you are really worried take the nyquil but use one-third less than the dose suggested on the nyquil bottle.

Question: can prostatitis cause redness on the tip of the penis? . experiencing pain/soreness and sensitivity on penis head also redness sometimes. i have been told it may be prostatitis but i am beginning to worry it is something worse (herpes? ). gonnohrea and chlamydia tests negative. has not responded to cipro after 3 weeks of treatment.
Baseline Response: no.
This is an issue that can be treated with anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti anti-fungal, anti -bacterial and anti -funga drugs. It is best to try them all at once.
Do not use any of these drugs on any other person.
Have never used any of the medications mentioned above.
Ask the doctor for advice.
How do I avoid having prostatosis?
Some people have the condition. Some of them can be cured.
What is prostatotic?
The condition

Expected Response: prostatitis should not cause redness/soreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct. there is likely another cause. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet based solely on your very brief description. you will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this redness/soreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis. you may want to consider seeing a urologist. it's probably just some ordinary skin irritation. try using a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it specializes in penis skin issues like this and will get things back to normal quickly and safely. it was a good move to get an std test. you can rule that stuff out. try the creme!
================================================================================
Question: what should liver counts be? . my liver count is 219. i want to know what the normal range is and what is considered high and low for a liver count.
Baseline Response: i want the normal blood count to be 219.
Example: if you have a normal blood volume and you have liver count of 150/80 then liver count can be calculated at 150/78.
Note: if liver count was not above 140 then you would not be able to use the normal liver count as a reference.
For example, if your liver count could be below 140 then your normal blood would be taken at 140/78, and if liver counts were above 140 you would be able use the liver count at 150 at that point.
The liver counts that are considered high or low can be measured using the following formula:
The normal blood blood volume is 150/79.
If you have normal blood volumes of 150 or higher then you can use the following equation:
If

Expected Response: there is really no such lab test as a liver count. there are specific liver tests like the alt ast etc. that all have their individula lab normal ranges. please review your test results again or specific ask which of these liver enzyme tests have a value of 219
================================================================================
Question: can hot baths or spas help alleviate arthritis pain?
Baseline Response: yes, the main reason I recommend hot baths is that they can relieve arthritis pain in a way that doesn't require you to do any medical procedures. I personally find that hot baths are very helpful to relieve arthritis, and that they are the only way to relieve pain in the back of the body.
Hot baths can help relieve pain with your body. So if you have arthritis, you can get hot baths. If you have pain, you have to get hot bath. If your pain is from arthritis, the best way to get your arthritis back is to get a hot bath, and then you can go to a chiropractor to get the pain.
What if I have arthritis?
What I can do to help alleviate my arthritis pain is to give hot baths to my patients. I am not a big fan of hot baths, but I do have a few ideas for ways to get better. Here are some

Expected Response: many people with arthritis find good relief from pain and stiffness with hot baths or spas. the moist heat increases muscle relaxation boosts blood supply to the site of pain and relieves rigidity and spasms in the muscles. but avoid hot tubs or spas if you have diabetes high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease or if you are pregnant.

Question: i'm perspiring 90% of the time. is that because i have a bit (115 f) of a fever? . also had have an annoying cough for the last 4 days that seems to be slowly going away with ratio-cortridon. also modestly hyperventilating 40% of the time even when just sitting. i'm on coversyl 8 mg. also: energy level seems down & frequent insomnia (even b4 the cough came). thank you
Baseline Response: yes, i think so.
Answer 1: i have had some pretty intense bouts of fever. i've had this for a few weeks now. i feel like i'm being on a hot streak. the last few days i have been feeling very tired and I have to go to sleep. when i wake up i feel so tired that i'm not even thinking. when my body feels like it's been burning, i feel very dizzy. i can't even breathe. i have also

Expected Response: i don't think you are having a 115 degree fever. that is a bit incompatible with life. since you cannot be diagnosed blindly over the internet based solely on your posting information i would suggest that you see a medical provider to determine the reason for your array of symptoms.
================================================================================
Question: how is coronary artery disease treated?
Baseline Response: the treatment is the same as the treatment for other heart diseases. The problem is that the patient does not know what to do with his or her heart.
What to do
The first thing you should do is to do something about the problem.
You will not have the heart disease you are looking for. The heart disease is not the same thing as the disease you want to get rid of.
If you have the disease, you can take the medication to prevent the heart attack.
The next thing you can do is get rid the heart attacks.
Your heart attack can be caused by a heart attack, a stroke, a heart disease, a coronary artery attack, or by a car accident.
When you get rid your heart attacks, you are not dying. You are not going to die.
This is because the heart is not in the same place you are now.
There is no difference between your heart

Expected Response: medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen to compensate for the reduced blood supply. three commonly used classes of drugs are the nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. nitroglycerin (nitro-bid) is an example of a nitrate. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) and atenolol (tenormin). examples of calcium blockers include nicardipine (cardene) and nifedipine (procardia adalat). unstable angina is also treated with aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. aspirin prevents clumping of platelets while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. when patients continue to have angina despite taking maximum medications or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing they usually need coronary arteriography. during coronary arteriography doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for percutaneous coronary intervention or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (ptca) where a small balloon is used to inflate the blockage. angioplasty (ptca) is usually followed by placement of a stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) to increase coronary artery blood flow. angioplasty can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. under x-ray guidance a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. a small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. the balloon is then inflated to push the artery open and a steel mesh stent is generally inserted. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (ptca). cabg surgery is ideal for patients with many narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.

Question: why is my genital boil bleeding after i put ointment on it? should i stop using this particular medication? . i have a genital boil (i know it's not warts or herpes because i am not sexually active). it is painful so i put neosporin +pain relief gel on it and the next time i went into the bathroom i found it was bleeding thought it wasn't before i put the ointment on it. should
Baseline Response: i was concerned about my genital heat and when i put it on it started bleeding and it is very painful. i did not want to stop using it. i am going to put it back on and i can't get it to stop bleeding again. i don't want to continue using this medication. i just want to know what to do next.
Answer, please.
Hi,
Hi.
My name is Sarah, I'm a 29 year old female. I'm on a personal relationship with my boyfriend

Expected Response: is the medicine zovirax or something like that? do you have pills also? do you think you could have washed in the shower a little too roughly? when i've gotten them (mine are actually herpes but called them boils for years because my husband wouldn't accept it until i made him go with me for a test last year). i do realize we get regular ole boils also. however i've never heard of bleeding. if the sore is currently open i would stop the medicine for a day then start back again and see how it does. alternatively i wish you could see or talk to a nurse or dr. but if you're on here you may not be able to do that. another thing i've found soothing is putting a warm chamomile tea bag on there for 1/2 hour; i got that from hubby- he brings me a bowl of hot water to keep rinsing & "steeping" the tea bag. when you wash just blot with a clean cloth (don't re-use until washed) / water only until healed better. the emergency room taught me that because i became allergic to soap & all ointments when i had any infections etc. it helps alot.

Question: all my test were negative. i just wanted to know if they are acurate after 13 days. especially for hiv. . has sex with another male and used condoms. none broke. unprotected oral sex tho. i got my hiv and other std screens and everythig was negative. i just wanted to know how effective these were after 13 days
Baseline Response: I was tested by the lab on a day 1. The lab said that the test came out positive. The test was negative for STI.
Answer #2:
Answer 3:
The lab said the test was positive for STIs. The tests were also negative for other drugs.
The test was not the same as the test that I had. The testing was positive.
So, when the lab is telling you that there is a difference in the test result, they can't be correct.
Solution:
If you have been using condoms for a long time and you use them to help

Expected Response: hi yes you can get a false negative and a false positive so just go get retested at a std/gum clinic the staff thee are very good at there job and there you can ask all the questions you want and they don't discriminate good luck

Question: i have or think i have hair loss when should i contact my doctor?
Baseline Response: A hair loss can be caused by a lot of different things. Most of the time the problem is the hair that is on your scalp. If you have a lot on your head, you may need to talk to your doctor about the problem. If your hair is too short, your doctor may recommend a hair loss. If hair loss is too severe, you might have to go to the doctor.
Answer - There are two kinds of hair loss:
- Hair loss caused by natural hair growth, which is usually caused by bacteria, and
- hair loss caused from unnatural growth.
Hair loss is caused by the fact that your hair grows in a way that it will be difficult to remove. In most cases, hair loss will be caused from natural hair. Hair loss can cause problems with your hair because it can be very difficult to get rid of it.
In the case

Expected Response: call your doctor if: your hair loss is sudden rather than gradual. you notice hair shedding in large amounts after combing or brushing or if your hair becomes thinner or falls out. you are concerned that a medicine may be causing your hair loss. you have a rash scaliness or any change in the skin on your scalp with hair loss. you see signs of bacterial infection on your scalp such as: increased pain. swelling redness tenderness or heat. red streaks extending from the area. discharge of pus. fever of or higher with no other cause. your hair is gradually thinning and balding and you want to discuss treatment options with your doctor. watchful waiting watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without using medical treatment. watchful waiting may be appropriate if your hair loss is gradual and is similar to the pattern of hair loss seen in your parents or brothers or sisters. but if your gradual hair loss bothers you your doctor may be able to slow or reverse it. if clumps of hair fall out your hair loss may be caused by a disease and it is important to contact your doctor. hair loss caused by alopecia areata often reverses on its own. watchful waiting is an option after you have been diagnosed with this condition. who to see health professionals who can give you advice and treatment on hair loss include: family medicine doctors. internists. physician assistants. nurse practitioners. dermatologists. hair transplant surgery is usually done by: dermatologists. plastic surgeons. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Question: what foods are safe to consume with celiac disease?
Baseline Response: no, you are not going to get any better from eating celiac diets with celibate gluten.
Answer #2: what are the benefits of eating a gluten-free diet?
As with all of the foods you may or may not be eating, the benefits and risks of gluten-containing foods outweigh the benefits.
The most important thing to remember is that you are eating the foods that you eat. The only foods that are safe for you to consume are those foods that contain no gluten. The majority of foods you should avoid are foods that have been processed, added, or otherwise altered to make them gluten-friendly.
How to Avoid Gluten-Related Foods
You should not eat foods that include any of the following:
- gluten-filled cereals and cereals that contain any type of starch or gluten, including white breads, breads made with rice flour, pasta, rice

Expected Response: there has been much advancement to assist with complying with a gluten-free diet. the food allergen labeling and consumer protection act requires manufacturers to provide more information about the ingredients used to make their food products by specifying the presence of allergens on the product label including wheat. wheat-free does not mean gluten-free so you will still need to read the rest of the ingredients.

Hi!
I am trying to get a new term birth. I was expecting a baby girl. I am so glad i got my term birth as it would be a real blessing in disguise. I love the fact that I have a baby and am ready for my second term birth!! My first term birth was a baby boy. He was a little over 6 weeks and we did not have any complications. I

Question: can taking clarithromycin 500 mg make my ulcer pain worse?
Baseline Response: yes. I feel bad about taking it and I think it will make it worse. However, I know that the medicine is not going to help me. I do not want to have my ulcers and I am not sure what the medicine does for me.

Expected Response: just like many antibiotics clarithromycin can cause upset stomach nausea vomiting and diarrhea. however there isn’t any contraindication regarding a history of ulcers when taking this medication. if you are taking any ulcer medications it would be important to check with your pharmacist to make sure there aren’t any drug interactions that would decrease the effectiveness of your ulcer medication which would cause flare-ups. the medication can be taken with or without food. if the upset stomach is present try taking it with food to see if it subsides. if at any point it worsens you should consult your health-care provider to see if another medication is better for you.

Question: doxycycline potential liver damage. i don't drink smoke or have any vice. i get annual exams and my liver always checks good. about a week before my annual exam this year i had just completed a two therapy of doxycycline and my liver values alt and ast were out of range. alt was 6 points out of range and ast was 9 points out of range. . is this possible stress from the antibiotic cycle? are these values high or demonstrating damage to be concerned about? . . thank you.
Baseline Response: i have to say i was skeptical of the risk of doxone taking in my liver. The risk is very low. i am still recovering from my liver transplant. i have a liver transplant and i don´t know if this is going to be a problem.

Expected Response: any anti-biotic used long term can cause liver damage.

Question: if someone is allergic to formaldehyde where can i find a list of products that do not have it?
Baseline Response: you can find it on your local health department.
If you can't find it, ask a health care provider for more information.
Answer 1: you cannot get a list from the FDA.

Expected Response: formaldehyde sensitivity (causing a rash) is typically diagnosed by patch testing on the skin. if you are found to have a contact allergy avoidance of that item is recommend. there are several other preservatives that are also formaldehyde releasers. these include quaternium-15 imidazolidinyl urea diazolidinyl urea dmdm hydantoin and bronopol. in many cases i recommend avoiding all of these if patch testing is positive to formaldehyde. your doctor can help you decide if the formaldehyde releasers should also be avoided. also your skin doctor may have access to the contact allergen replacement database (card) which can assist in generating lists of products that do not contain certain products in them (such as formaldehyde).

Question: i went to the doctor and am being treated for strep but after three days of antibiotics. i still have spots in my throat and i am still in a lot of pain.
Baseline Response: i have a fever and is in a bad state. i am in the hospital for 2 days. i have to go to the emergency room and have my fever checked.

Expected Response: unless your doctor actually did a test (rapid strep test or culture) to confirm that you have strep the diagnosis could be incorrect. you may have a viral infection or even mono. obviously since i can't examine you i have no way of making that important diagnostic call. most viral infections improve on day four (even if you do nothing) so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again.

Question: are there any known links between ovarian cancer and bipolar disease? . my friend has been treated and "cured" of the ovarian cancer - removal of ovary and chemotherapy - but now suffers from bipolar and schizophrenia. could there be any relationship between the two? . she has suffered for several years and has even undergone several rounds of ect with no lasting improvement. could there be an underlying hormonal issue that has not yet been addressed? where could she go to seek further help. she is the mother of a 5 year old little girl and needs help. thank you.
Baseline Response: The link between ovarian cancers and bipolar is not fully understood and there are a number of factors that can influence the level of activity of the thyroid gland and may influence the development of bipolar disorder.

Expected Response: i have bipolar ii disorder and poly cystic ovarian syndrome. i have done a lot of research and have learned that some of the medications used to treat bipolar disorder can cause poly cystic ovarian syndrome. whether it can cause cervical cancer i have never read a study that linked the two. did your friend have hpv. i believe more than 60 or 70% of the population has it and it can cause cervical cancer.

Question: i am eligible for medicare on feb. 1. can my company deduct for health insurance that i will never use? . my company is requiring that i be given insurance under the aca. i will be receiving and paying for medicare by february 1 2014. not only that but the plan that my company wants to provide has a deductible of $5 000. if i refuse that same $400 will be deposited into a 401k plan. again keep in mind that i am going to be 65 on feb. 2
Baseline Response: i have the option to take my insurance but i am not eligible for this plan. i am a disabled person and i am paying for my medicine. i can only take my medicine with me. i have been on this plan for 3 years and i have paid for it. i want to see what the plan will do to me. if it doesn't do that i can still take my medication but i don't have a 401(

Expected Response: medicare counts as qualifying insurance coverage and once you're eligible you won't need any additional insurance. you also have the right to turn down your employer's offer of insurance -- they can't force you to buy it. once you have medicare (make sure you sign up for parts a b and c to be fully covered) you can drop your employer's insurance if you feel the coverage is too expensive for you.

Baseline Response: The ball is just a small opening at the end of the vagina. I am not sure if it is in the vagina or not.
The vagina is a small little hole that is just like a hole in a shoe. it is a hole that has a hole at the opening. The

Expected Response: you may have a prolapsed uterus and this "ball with a dimple on it" may be your cervix protruding from your vagina. your gynecologist or even a primary care medical provider can confirm this most-likely diagnosis.

Question: my 2 month old grand daughter cries as if she is in pain and it happens more often in the evenings is this normal? . this to me is not a normal "fussy" cry we have asked the dr and they said it's normal but i don't agree and want to push the issue but don't know where to start it started when she was about a month old
Baseline Response: she started crying at 8pm and she's never been more upset at her then the day before. It's a normal thing for a baby to cry during the day and she does not cry in the evening.
Answer 5: she was crying all day and night when her mother was away and the nurse was there to help her. she never had a problem with the nurse but it happened again at 11:00 and she was able to get help from the nurse.

Expected Response: the rule of threes : a child over three weeks old and under three months who cries more than three hours a day (mostly in the evening) more than three days a week. does this fit your grand-daughter's pattern? the may have colic. if so the good news is that it may miraculously disappear soon after age three. colic remains a mysterious pediatric problem that has plagued sleep-deprived parents for ages. as a seasoned parent yourself your kids may not have had it. colicy kids can scream for hours and drive new parents (and grandmothers) wacky. obviously this is just a blind guess over the internet but i have seen this zillions of times in my primary care pediatric practice. yes there could be other reasons but since her doctor did not find a reason colic is definitely on the possibility table. do an internet search on colic. use only medical sites please like webmd or the american academy of pediatrics.

Question: do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?
Baseline Response: it's a pretty simple question. The first thing to do is remove all blackheads, the second is to remove all the blackheads from the whitehead. I've used the word "blackhead" to mean any of the four types of blackheads. The term "black" is often used to refer to any blackhead. If you have blackheads that you would like removed, you can do that by adding blackheads to your existing whitehead and adding blackhead to your other whitehead (which is the part of the whiteface that is not black).
This is a good way to identify blackheads as a race, but it's not as easy to identify the blackhead as an individual. For instance, if you have a blackhead that you think is a "whitehead", you may have to go through a series of steps to remove it. You can also go through the

Expected Response: the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.

Question: how long does sperm live outside of body. how long does sperm live outside the body. like on clothing and bed sheets.
Baseline Response: - You can live in a womb. you can live on top of your body. it depends on what you are doing right now.
Note: there are some people who think that sperm are the only way to live.
I have seen people with sperm that are quite old, but they are still alive.
People with sperm, they have a lot of health problems.
They can be a little bit more dangerous.
You can live with sperm from all over the world.
Sperm can be taken from any person.
Some people think that they have sperm, but it's not true.
Many people think they have an egg, but the fact is that the sperm doesn't get to the egg.
If you

Expected Response: sperm will not live on clothing or bed sheets. when it has "dried" it has "died". sperm that is properly frozen (cytogenetically) can live for years under proper conditions so technically this is consider out of the body too. you don't really have to worry about clothing sperm stains. those little tadpole-like organisms do not last long (only a few minutes) outside the body nor do they swim around looking for vaginas. semen-containing sperm is viable in or near the vaginal area so suggest that your sperm-making friend use a condom. even when you are must playing around.

Question- 1: What is the best way to deal with pain in your body?
Source:- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki

Expected Response: pancreatic cancer is a terrible terrible cancer and yes it is typically fatal. one of my best friends had pancreatic cancer (a medical provider) and described the pain as "indescribable". he had to have a careful balance between pain control with over-sedation (and constipation from the opiates) to the point where he could not function and just mentally dealing with the pain without the use of medications (very difficult). much of the cancer pain is related to metastasis (the spreading of the cancer to bone and other organs). it would be wonderful to have any remaining time pain-free but sadly this may not happen. as long as this person is currently pain-free now they are being blessed.

Question: my son got a scrape on his elbow. there appears to be a rash where the bandage was. could this be an allergic reaction? . at first they were just bumps but now they appear white almost puss like. i do not know what type of bandage was used since this happened at school.
Baseline Response: the bandages did not protect against the rash.
I would like to ask:
What are the symptoms of a rash of this size?
A rash of the size of a human being is the most common cause of severe allergic reactions. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction include:
- Itchy skin, including the rash (which may appear as a white rash).
- The rash appears as a brownish-brownish rash. (This is usually caused by the fungus that causes the skin to grow and then rot.)
- Other skin, such as the eye, may have small bumps.
- If there is a rash, it may be

Expected Response: could be your son is allergic to the adhesives on the band-aid. it should go away in a couple of days. if not. wait. wait. go see the doctor. <positive_smiley> i would check with the school and find out what kind of band-aid so your doctor can have something to work with in his/hers diagnosis. not much you did not know but i hope your son feels better.

Question: why do teens need at least eight hours of sleep?
Baseline Response: the answer is that they need at most eight hours for sleep.
The answer to this question is: The brain has a hard time getting to sleep. It needs a lot of sleep to get to sleep, and that's why teens need to get at least seven hours of rest every day.
So what does that mean?
There are four main parts of the brain that are responsible for sleep:
1) the amygdala (the area of the skull where the amygdala is located), the nucleus accumbens (the part of the nucleus that is responsible for regulating the brain's sleep) and the prefrontal cortex (the region of the cortex that regulates the brain).
2) the hippocampus (the brain's part of your brain that contains the information that helps us remember the past) and amygdala (where we think about what is important to us)
3) the medial prefrontal cortex – the part of our brain

Expected Response: does your teen get fewer than eight hours? if so listen up: your teen is more at risk for obesity and all the health problems connected to that (high blood pressure heart disease stroke etc. ). the link between sleep deprivation and a higher risk for obesity and related cardiovascular problems may not seem obvious. but here’s the key: when you’re sleep deprived (and yes for the vast majority of teens fewer than eight hours on a regular basis qualifies as being sleep deprived) you’ll crave high carbohydrate foods — especially those that are loaded with fat salt and sugar. i know it’s not fair to crave junk food when we’re already lacking in the sleep department but you can blame our ancient dna on this fact. encoded in our genes are signals to eat like this when we’re tired. hormones that control our signals of hunger and conversely fullness get thrown out of whack when we are sleep deprived. in a new study published this month in the journal sleep researchers determined that teens can’t escape this hard-wired reality that adults are saddled with. though plenty of studies in recent years have implicated obesity with sleep deprivation in adults not many have been performed on younger generations to find similar associations. in this latest study researchers found sleep-deprived teens: * consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fat. * ate more snacks than those who slept eight hours or more a night. * ate more total calories. and you know what that spells: weight gain. when we think of adolescents losing out on sleep our minds quickly turn to potential accidents and an inability to concentrate or perform well in school. studies like this highlight the health consequences of sleep deprivation. the health repercussions of sleep deprivation at this “tender” age may actually be worse than those of an adult. for starters teens are establishing habits they will keep for a lifetime. a teen who gets used to eating poorly and packing on the pounds will likely grow into an overweight adult when it’ll be that much harder to change those habits and lose the excess weight. the more fatty foods you eat the more you crave them. secondly we’re only beginning to understand the biomechanics of a developing person’s metabolism. do teens who begin to have metabolic disturbances early in life suffer from a lifetime of irreversible higher health risks? it wouldn’t surprise me. and those higher risks may go far beyond just obesity and cardiovascular challenges. they may in fact go as far as upping the risk for cancer. so thirdly it’s a foregone conclusion: teens need their sleep as much as adults do.

Question: what causes stomach pain and swelling after eating every meal? been this way for 3 weeks. it started out about 3 weeks ago. i have stomach pains and severe swelling after i eat. then a couple days later i got my period and it seems my swelling is not as bad. so i went to the docter and he thought it was my gallbladder. i had blood work done normal. sent me for ultrasound normal. then hida scan normal. still having problems everytime i eat my stomach starts hurting really bad and my stomach swells some. my stomach is constanly sore. .
Baseline Response: when you have stomach pain, it's usually a normal thing to have and when it's a problem, it usually is. but if you are eating something that is causing stomach pain or swelling, there is a chance you may be having an issue. it is best to do some testing on yourself first and to see if there is anything you can do to help.

Expected Response: the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed. i am having the same problem. my stomach is so tender and sore. i have excruciating pain. i have had a lot of test and all the doctors said was gastritis and colitis. i am not taking any medication for this and just wondering what i should do. i can't live in this kind of pain. there should be some kind of cure for this. i don't have diarrhea or sick stomach. i had a lot of stomach issues i was diagnosed with h pylori it is a bacterial infection in the stomach my gastroenterologist did a breathing test to find that i had a very severe case this was after 3 ct scans an endoscope and a colonoscopy! ask your doctor about diverticulitis.

Source of the text is here: http.ncni.nlms.nih (accessed 12/01/2006)

Expected Response: thank you for the interesting question. i completely understand your logic. the laws are changing every day in the field of fertility. in the lab setting it has become common practice to increase the number of potentially viable eggs therby expanding the odds of pregnancy occurring. another example of these changes may be seen in the long held belief that a woman is born with a finite quantity of eggs at birth. this principle is being questioned in an animal study. please open the following link to a webmd article that discusses that study. <link> - although i’m not an expert in fertility issues i’ll share with you what i know to be accurate as follows: the number of follicles that will ever become a mature egg is partially dependent on the monthly cycle where a varying and undetermined number of follicles (potentially mature eggs) estimated to probably be in the neighborhood of 1 000 is lost. this follicle loss is also influenced by hormonal variations. the number of follicles remaining each month after the monthly cycle will influence the potential number of mature eggs in a woman’s lifetime. the more follicles that are lost monthly the sooner that the follicle supply will become exhausted and menopause will begin. with all of the advances in fertility it does not seen yet possible to calculate the number of remaining mature eggs after the monthly cycle.

Question: how does scoliosis affect the immune system? . my daughter was born with spina bifida occulta. her cord is tethered but did not protrude or leave a whole at birth. after chronic pain she it was found at 3 yrs old. at 4 she was diagnosed with scoliosis the dr said it was attributed to the spina bifida. she also has severe asthma and allergies to food medications and pollen/dust/etc. how do these affect her immune system and why? . she is often absent from school and stays sick for longer periods of time.
Baseline Response: The spina fibrosis is caused by the spindles on the spirochetes of the spindle. These spindle spindlers are found on the fibrous tissue of the fibula. They are called spindle-like spines. The spindle spindle is a small, circular, round organ. The fibula is the smallest part of the

Expected Response: scoliosis as an independent entity does not change the immune system it is just a developmental anomaly shared by many. this is not to say that your daughter does not have an immune problem due to something else so her doctor would be the best judge of this -- someone who knows her complete medical history. her allergies and asthma and some of the medications used to control it can certainly have an influence but not the scoliosis.

Question: i have a very wrinkly neck! help!
Baseline Response: i am very wrinkled and i have always been in a bad shape. i am always in pain. i have been in pain for a long time. i was always in a good shape and i can feel my neck.
Answer
Answer : i have one of these neck problems. i think that i have this problem because i have never been in the shape of my neck before and i never have been able to walk. i know that i need to go to a doctor because i am so tired and i am not able to go out. i can't walk. I just cannot. i cant walk.

Expected Response: your first approach is to identify the underlying causes and potentially aggravating conditions such as pre-existing sun damage or ongoing excessive sun exposure. you should incorporate a sun block and tretinoin-containing compounds in your daily skin care regimen along with an exfoliator and hydrating creams. if you have significantly relaxed skin on your neck you may want to consider being evaluated by a plastic surgeon to discuss options for a neck lift.

Question: can you get hand foot and mouth disease more than once? . my 11 month son was diagnosed with this today and his doctor acted as if you can only contract this once although she did not specifically say that. she told me that children over the age of 4 are usually spared as they have most likely already had the disease in the past. i have never had this nor has my husband or my two daughters (10 and 5). just looking for any extra precautions that i may need to take.
Baseline Response: no, i don't. i just want to know how to prevent this from happening.
I have been diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma and it is a very serious disease, but i can't stop it. i'm not sure what the treatment is for it, but it would be good if it were a natural remedy. I have tried the drug fluoxetine and the medicine is so effective it was a lifesaver for my child.
My son is now

Expected Response: most helpful answer exposure to an infectious disease like hand foot and mouth disease does not automatically mean that the exposed person will get it. your children may be at mild risk not likely you or your husband. the vast majority of children will not get hand foot and mouth disease ever again however there can be very rare cases when those skin lesions will surface again (milder the second time). this can be due to another similar viral species that causes identical skin lesions or a rare reactivation of the prior infection.

Question: when should i call the doctor regarding nausea and vomiting?

Answer 2: If you are taking a low dose of medicine, and you are experiencing vomiting or diarrhea, you should call a doctor immediately. If you do not want to go to the doctor you should ask your doctor.

Expected Response: if the symptoms last for more than 24 hours if the diagnosis is uncertain if there is concern about dehydration or if the patient has underlying medical conditions that make them more fragile medical care should be accessed sooner rather than later. infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration and may not have as much reserve as an adult. if there is concern about dehydration or the inability to tolerate fluids a healthcare provider should be contacted. if nausea and vomiting are associated with pain fever vomiting blood or having bloody or black tarry bowel movements medical care should be sought immediately. vomiting is a symptom of an illness and is not a disease in itself. if the symptom persists for more than 24 ro 48 hours it may be wise to contact a medical care provider.

Question: what could cause a very sudden onset of nausea dizziness and feeling off balance? no lead in not on any meds. thx! . it's mostly cleared up about 2 hours later. i was driving at onset and when i got out of the car i also had some trouble walking -- fine for a few steps and then i'd stagger for a couple.
Baseline Response: it can be very difficult to tell when you're dizzy. In general, if you're under the influence of alcohol, you might experience nausea or vomiting. If you're being taken to the hospital for a medical emergency, you may need to ask your doctor for a blood test.
Thx!
I have a few questions.
What are the symptoms of nausea and vomiting?
What is your history of vomiting? If you have any, please tell me.
Who is the person who has the nausea and/or vomiting? (or if it's not, what do you think?)

Expected Response: your experience could have been caused by literally dozens of conditions. some of the possibilities include: stroke; transient ischemic attack (tia); vertigo; syncope; inner ear disturbance; medication side effect; diabetic event; and heart irregularities. i suggest that you start off by seeing your family doctor. that person knows your medical history best and can begin a basic investigation by way of diagnostic testing. additionally the family doctor may refer you to other medical specialists including a cardiologist and neurologist.

Question: why do some people get a lot of warts and others don’t?
Baseline Response: because they have a disease. I've had one in my last year of treatment. I was diagnosed with a blood clot and I had to have surgery on my lung, and I didn't want to have a scar on my throat because it was really painful. I wanted to get rid of the scar, but I didn�t have the time to do that. I felt like I could�t get rid, so I tried to make a deal with the doctor. He said that if you go to the hospital and get an operation on your lung, you can get the scar removed and you don�t need a hospital visit.
I�m not the only one who has had a scar. I have had people who have had lung cancer. I�ve had people with kidney disease.
One of the things I�m seeing is that the people who are very sick,

Expected Response: doctors aren’t sure but they believe that certain individuals have immune systems that are more able to fight off the viruses and prevent warts from growing. also just as some people are more likely to get poison ivy the genetic makeups and immune systems of certain individuals make them more susceptible to the viruses that cause skin warts. it is also common to see warts on multiple siblings in the same family. and children of people who had skin warts as children are often quite susceptible to skin warts themselves says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. still experts have yet to determine exactly what is different in the immune systems of people who get skin warts frequently.

Question: how can i handle headaches during pregnancy?
Baseline Response: It's very easy to get headaches during the first 3 months of pregnancy. The most common symptom of pregnancy is nausea and vomiting. The symptoms include nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, if you have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea during pregnancy, it is best to get medical help immediately.
If you are pregnant and have nausea during pregnancy and have a history of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, you should seek medical attention immediately. If your doctor does not diagnose your pregnancy, you may need to have surgery.
I have a headache during pregnancy. Can I get a prescription for pain medication?
You may need a prescription to help you get a pain medication. The pain medication is a pain reliever that can relieve the symptoms of pain. It can also help to relieve the pain of other pain-related problems.
When can I take pain medication during pregnancy if I have a chronic pain disorder?
P

Expected Response: headaches can be caused by tension congestion constipation or in some cases preeclampsia. they can occur anytime during pregnancy. recommendations: apply an ice pack to your forehead or the back of your neck. rest sit or lie quietly in a low-lit room. close your eyes and try to release the tension in your back neck and shoulders. try tylenol (acetaminophen) occasionally. stay away from ibuprofen and other aspirin-like anti-inflammatories (nsaids) since these reduce amniotic fluid and can also thin your blood which could make it harder to stop bleeding during delivery. ask your health-care provider before taking any other medications for your headaches. contact your health-care provider if you have nausea with your headaches if your headache is severe and does not go away or if you have blurry vision double vision or blind spots.

Question: my wisdom teeth have come in and are beginning to rot. if they don't become infected will they fall out? . will the nerve die? or if the tooth is gone will the root still hurt?
Baseline Response: I have never seen a tooth like this. I have seen many of them with very strong pain. I've seen them in my practice for years. They look like they are coming out of the mouth. I can't believe I've been doing this for years!
Answer #2: I know that the root of the tooth will be hard to remove. will the tooth get damaged?
The root of a tooth will not become damaged unless the tooth has been broken into.
Answer#3: The root of my tooth has a hard time moving because I can not see where it is. I am very lucky.

Expected Response: it sounds like a deteriorating situation to me. the teeth will not fall out the remaining teeth or roots can get infected and cause big problems. i would get to an oral surgeon as soon as possible to properly assess the situation and to hopefully prevent major infection and problems.

Question: do apples contain caffeine? . i've heard recently that apples contain caffeine. is this true?
Baseline Response: apple contains caffeine in a way that makes it less effective than a lot of other foods. If you look at the literature on caffeine in fruits, you will see that there are only two things that have caffeine in their fruit: caffeine and caffeine-containing foods. So if you are a fruit fan, you probably wouldn't think that apple juice contains caffeine, but it does.

Expected Response: no apples don’t contain any caffeine. there’s a widely held but false belief that apples are better than coffee at waking you up in the morning. i think that this claim was misconstrued and resulted in someone believing that apples contain caffeine. the theory is that the fructose (simple sugar) in apples is responsible in helping you wake up though i couldn’t find any research to support this or suggest that apples are better than coffee at waking you up. nutrient-rich there are many health benefits to consuming fruits like apples on a regular basis. helping you to wake up in the morning however may not be one of them. if you’re still curious try it for yourself to see if it can help you feel more alert after waking up. hi this is how it should read. nutrition of an apple serving size 182 grams (1 medium apple) calories 95 sugar 19 protein 0. 5mg vitamin c 8. 4mg vitamina 98. 3iu folate 5. 5mcg choline 6. 2mcg calcium 10. 9mg phosphorus 20mg potassium 195mg caffeine 0mg apples also contain very small traces of other vitamins and minerals. hi the answer you looking for read this. nutrition of an apple serving size 182 grams (1 medium apple) calories 95 sugar 19 protein 0. 5mg vitamin c 8. 4mg vitamin a 98. 3 iu folate 5. 5mcg choline 6. 2mcg calcium 10. 9mg phosphorus 20mg potassium 195mg caffeine 0mg apples also contain very small traces of other vitamins and minerals. so as you can see no. good luck

Question: is there a medical term for scarlet fever?
Baseline Response: scarlet fever is a fever that is caused by the development of a fever or swelling in the skin.
Answer, "The scarlet fibrosis is a condition that occurs when the fibrous tissue of the skin is exposed to light. This is a mild form of scarlet disease, but it is not a medical condition.
"It is a form of fever that can be caused by a lack of oxygen, and it is usually caused by infections such as colds or heat.

For information on the treatment of scarlets, please see http://health.scarlets.org.au.
The main article on scarlet is: http://cancer.harvard.edu/research/scarlet-trouble/
The following articles were submitted for publication by the Harvard Medical School

Expected Response: strangely enough that is the medical term used by most clinicians. it is a billable code with an icd-9 classification. scarlet fever is due to strep -- the same bacteria that causes strep throat. it is not considered any more dangerous if promptly and accurately diagnosed and treated. the rash of scarlet fever is called a scarletiniform streptococcal eruption if you want a different term. it is bright red (hence the name) and sandpapery rough. later the rash can desquamate (peel) like a sunburn.

Question: what is the differnce between an ovarian cyst and tumor
Baseline Response: the tumors are small, thin, and white.
The cysts are very common in women and are the cause of cancer.
Question 3: What is the difference between a woman who has a cystic and a woman with a tumor? Answer 4: who is the person who has the cytic tumor?
The tumor is part of a tissue that is connected to the ovaries.

Question: what is orthostatic hypotension?
Baseline Response: orthostasis is the sudden or prolonged loss of consciousness when the heart is in a rhythm.
When a person is in orthostasy, the heart beats continuously, and the heart can become weak.
The heart is a valve that pumps blood into the body. The heart pumps blood to the kidneys and the kidneys pump blood to other organs.
It is not possible to have an orthostatically hypotensive state because of the blood pressure.
A person can be in orthosteric hypotension for several reasons.
1. It is easy to get a good quality of life.
2. It can be a good exercise.
3. It helps with physical health.
4. It has a positive effect on health. Orthostatic exercise is good for the heart, the body, and others.
How to Perform Orthostatics
1) Start with a small amount of water and start to slowly add

Expected Response: when a person stands up from sitting or lying down the body must work to adjust to that change in position. it is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. if the body fails to do this adequately blood pressure falls and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure). adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: a heart strong enough to pump. arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze. enough blood and fluid within the vessels. when the body changes position a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the cardiovascular system as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. the autonomic nervous system can be considered to "run in the background" of the body regulating body processes that we take for granted. there is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speed things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. these names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster your palms get sweaty your eyes dilate and your hair stands on end. acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. these two systems are in balance and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day. when the body moves to a standing position pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity which causes blood to flow towards the legs. almost immediately the sympathetic system is stimulated causing the heart rate to increase the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully and blood vessels to constrict or narrow. all of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs. without these changes gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain causing symptoms of lightheadedness or even passing out. orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness.

Question: do boys with measles become sterile?
Baseline Response: yes.
Answer 2: Can we use an egg?

Expected Response: no not necessarily. actually it is mumps not measles that has a predilection for causing problems in the gonads. complications of measles tend to be more central nervous system / neurological. namely things like meningitis. i guess it would be possible for a severe case of measles to cause issues with the reproductive tract but this would not likely be a common complication. worldwide measles remains among the leading causes of childhood deaths. this is why vaccination is so so important.

Question: what are the different surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist?
Baseline Response: the hand is usually used for treatment in a variety of ways including a variety a variety to be determined by the patient's needs. For example, the patient may be asked to perform a manual or manual intervention in a controlled setting. The hand may be used to perform medical surgery such as an MRI, a tricorder, or a cardiopulmonary bypass.
A typical surgical procedure for arthritis of a hand is the removal of a bone from the right hand. The surgeon may use a bone graft to remove the bone, usually a transection. A bone graft may be performed as a secondary procedure in the absence of a primary surgical procedure.
An amputation is usually done with a knife or a saw. The patient may then be instructed to use a saw to cut the bone and then a blade to cut it. The surgical procedure may involve a combination of two different surgical techniques

Expected Response: treatment/surgery for painful arthritic fingers and how to prevent further deterioration

Question: i have been off my birthcontrol for about a month now and havent had my period could i be pregnant? . my last period was on december 9th and that also is the last time i was on birth control. i did have unprotected sex right after my peroid. i havent had my peroid and i have been feeling more tried my breast at times hurt and tingle and at times i am a lil nauses. could i be pregnant?
Baseline Response: i cant.
Answer #2: i am pregnant. i am not going to get pregnant. I am just going to go and get my doctor.

Expected Response: if you have been off birth control having unprotected sex and now experiencing no period breast pain and nausea. then of course you could be pregnant. there can be certainly be other reasons to account for your array of symptoms but pregnancy would be high on the list and would need to be considered first.
================================================================================
Question: what are neutrophils?
Baseline Response: they are a group of cells that produce neutrophil-like proteins.

Expected Response: neutrophils are a type of white blood cell which fight infections. neutrophils circulate through the blood and are normally detected on routine complete blood count (cbc) tests as part of the white blood cell count. many more neutrophils are on standby in the bone marrow and clinging to blood vessel walls to be released into the blood if needed. neutrophils are the “first responders” when the body is invaded by bacteria viruses or other organisms. guided by chemical signaling they travel to the area of infection and attack. neutrophils contain tiny compartments called granules in which they store toxic chemicals that act as their weapons against microorganisms. these substances are effective at killing bacteria and viruses but also contribute to inflammation with swelling redness and often pain. a low neutrophil count can be caused by drugs (especially chemotherapy) immune disorders and problems in the bone marrow. a very low neutrophil count increases the risk of serious infection.

Question: can your lungs be clear with pneumonia? . my mother is 73 years old. she has a history of copd etc. she was in the hospital from 11/13 to 11/16 with pneumonia. she was not getting better in fact she was declining. they kept saying her lungs were clear. she went to the er last night. she has been admitted with pneumonia again much worse than before. can your lungs be clear with pneumonia?
Baseline Response: can you be sure that your lungs are clear? Can you tell which ones are clear and which ones don't?
My mother is 75 years old and has been in the ICU for the last 5 years. she is in good health and is recovering. she needs a good bed rest and a good oxygen supply. can you tell if she has any other problems with her lungs?

Expected Response: the word "clear" may be referring to two things: one would be listening to the lungs and not hearing any abnormal sounds like crackling that would indicate pneumonia. another would be a clear x-ray; pneumonia not being radiologically proven. it is nice to have both to prove the diagnosis but medical provider often treat things provisionally (feeling they are high risk like your mother and likely to get pneumonia) or clinically (having all of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia without any confirmation). your mother may have been admitted because of her age her medical history and the fact that she was getting worse. pneumonia may just be the admitting diagnosis but may not end up being her final diagnosis.

Question: are there any health related issues later on in life for preemies? i was 4lbs born in 1947
Baseline Response: no
Answer to question: if you are a pre-born, are there anything that you would like to do to help your preemies to grow and develop? i had a baby in 1947 and had to have a little mastectomy to get a baby. how did i get pregnant? i am a pre baby and i love my baby so much i had to get my own mastectomy and to have my own baby. i also have a child that i love so much and i am going to get the mastectomy in the near future. what do you do if your baby is too small and doesn't have any of the above things going on? i have a son that has been born with a mastectomy. i have had to take care of him and he has been very good at running and eating. do you want to have some kind of care for him

Expected Response: you are 65 years old or close to it. you made it to retirement and are eligible for social security. the fact that you weighed four pounds in 1947 is probably irrelevant right now. if you had any consequences are a result of your premature birth they would have been obvious at that time. certainly not now.

Question: i am always feeling itchy on my face and my back. i have brown patches on my back and face(am black).
Baseline Response: i have a lot of gray on my skin and i just want to tell you that my skin is a lot more forgiving and forgiving than i would have imagined. i am in no way saying that you are perfect and you should be able to adjust to whatever you want. i'm just saying that if you want to be a good person and have a good relationship with someone, then you need to have the right kind of people around you. if you do not, you are not a good partner.

Expected Response: i'm sorry you're going through this. feeling itchy all the time is very annoying! unfortunately this is the type of thing that can only be diagnosed through a physical examination. so many conditions from eczema to simple dry skin can cause the symptoms you're describing. you can get on the path to diagnosis by visiting your primary care provider (pcp). he or she is in the best position to determine if your symptoms are skin issues or reflect an underlying health problem. if necessary your pcp will refer you to a specialist for treatment. i hope this helps!

Question: can methylpredisolone tablets cause the recent outbreak of meningitis
Baseline Response: It is possible that some of the tablets used in the present study did not cause meningococcal meningitosis. However, in most cases, the tablets may not be safe and have been linked to serious health problems.
Recommendation: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that tablets be taken with methylprediabol (MDP) tablets, as well as with methylphenidate tablets.
In the current study, we used the following medications as controls:

Methylphenidate: 5 mg tablets (1 tablet per day)

Meicocin: 4 mg tablets

Dihydrofluorocin (DFR): 2 mg tablets. The authors have not confirmed the presence of any other active ingredients in the drug.

The present study is a retrospective study, and the risk of developing a clinical condition for which methyl

Expected Response: the ongoing meningitis outbreak is scary and people are very confused about its cause. the current fungal meningitis outbreak is related to contaminated vials of an injectable steroid preparation called methylprednisolone acetate which is used to treat spinal pain. that means the people currently affected by fungal meningitis are those who received injections from a tainted vial of steroid preparation. (note: the investigation into this situation is ongoing and more medications may have been implicated by the time you read this. ) in addition to date all of the contaminated product has been linked to a single compounding pharmacy called new england compounding center (necc). all products made by necc are currently under recall by the food and drug administration. methylprednisolone oral tablets also are a steroid compound. these tablets are used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions among other things. to date methylprednisolone tablets have not been linked to any cases of fungal meningitis. as long as your tablets didn't come from necc (which is probably the case; most methylprednisolone tablets are mass-produced in factories) you should be safe. if you have any concerns about this contact your pharmacist or the prescribing physician. i hope you find this information useful.

Question: what is jc virus? . my dr. said one of my medications i can take for ms could cause this jc virus?
Baseline Response: jc viruses are common and can cause severe and lifelong damage to the body and brain.
It is important to know that jc is not a virus and it is not contagious. However, it does spread through the body through your body and other organs. It is not an illness.
What is a jc viral infection?
Jc virus is a type of infectious viral infection.
JC viruses cause the same symptoms that are seen with other jc infections.
The symptoms of jc include:
- Fever, fever, sore throat, and/or rash
- Loss of appetite
- Pain in the joints, feet, and stomach
- Dry mouth
- Stomach ache
- Hives and ulcers
- Cough
- Flu
- Acne
- Eye pain
- An

Expected Response: that's a really good question. basically it's a normally harmless virus that most people already have but immune suppressing drugs can cause it to reactivate and do damage. here's a link to a wiki article about it: <link> and a link to an article about the risks to ms patients: <link>#3

Question: almost 12 y/o boy complaining of tenderness at and around the nipple area upon touch. is this normal? . diagnosed with asthma @ 4 months. controlled with qvar inhaler. otherwise in good health.
Baseline Response: most likely this is the case, but it may be a side effect of the medication.

Expected Response: very normal. this is most likely adolescent gynecomastia (you can find lots of information on this temporary condition from webmd or a google search). tender nipples or getting breast development can be frightening during puberty. while this condition is temporary it can last for a few years involve both breasts and will keep his shirt on for a while. let him read what you find on the internet and assure him that he is not alone. i see this every week in our adolescent clinic. this is just raging hormones. males have both male and female hormones and this is just a response from the female hormone. his male hormones (testosterone) will still be prevalent. gynecomastia can create very tender breasts so just bumping in to them or having his peers or sibling tease him can be emotionally painful. be nice. don't tease or let anyone else do it either. if he wants to wear a shirt in the swimming pool let him. if you look around there are many other teens wearing shirts too. this is not just to protect their back from sun. they may have some breast development as well.
================================================================================
Question: is it safe to give a 2 month old pedialyte on a daily basis?
Baseline Response: Yes, it is. This is a great question, because a good pedialo can help you to stay safe and well-fed. However, it's important to note that there is no perfect pedial to give, and there is certainly no perfect formula.
Some pedials are less flexible than others. This means that some pediales may not always be optimal for your needs. For example, it can take some time for a pediale to produce enough to fill all the gaps in your diet.
It's also important to remember that pedial formulas are not intended for children. There are plenty of parents who are very concerned about their child's health. So, it makes sense to give them a little more time to get the right amount of nutrition.
However, if you have a baby, you may want to give it more time, and get

Expected Response: there may be some reason that the pediatrician would suggest this but in general we recommend breastmilk or formula exclusively at that age. my rationale is that there are only so many ounces in a day that a 2 month old will consume so you might as well offer some calories.

Question: variose veins on my left testicle? . hi im 17 years old and i have large varicose looking veins on my left testicle. they don't cause me any pain or bother or interfere with things in any way they're just ugly looking. i've had them for as long as i can remember at least since i hit puberty. are they a problem? and will they cause any health problems in the future?
Baseline Response: no. it's not a problem.
Answer : i have small varicosa (or small veins) on my right testicle and they cause me some pain. this is due to my age. it is possible that they can cause some health problems if they are not treated properly.

Expected Response: you are most likely talking about varicoceles. this type of varicose veins are most common on the left side and in most cases will not cause any issues. however very large varicoceles have the potential to decrease your fertility by lowering your sperm count (on that side only). about 1 in 12 adolescent males have these things and they rarely require any medical intervention. to read more about them just put "adolescent varicoceles" in your google search engine.

Question: how many days after having unprotected sex can sperm stay in your vagina? not sure when i got pregnant. my last lmp was 10/13 cycle was about 28 days. i had unprotected sex on 10/17 10/24 what day might i have gotten pregnant i am confused please help.
Baseline Response: i have been having unprotected sexual intercourse with a man at least once in my life. he was very nice and very helpful and I am very grateful for his service.

Expected Response: sperm can remain alive and viable for about three to five days if protected in the cervical mucous. is it really that important on which day you became pregnant? if it is an exact date of conception may be a difficult to determine based solely on isolated days of unprotected sex.
================================================================================
Question: how can benign prostatic hyperplasia bph be prevented?
Baseline Response: the primary prevention of benign prostacies is the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. The primary prevention is to have a large number of regular or frequent regular injections of antiinflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and ibuprocin. Antibiotics should be administered in the context of a person's history of pain or a person who has had pain problems, such a person may have had a history of a history associated with a pain disorder.
The primary prevention against benign prostace is to reduce the number of daily injections of a drug, such that the number is less than 1,500 daily.
Biopathies may be prevented by using a combination of antihistamines, anti-histamine- and anti-inferiority-based anti-inflammatories, and medications such as anti-apoptotic medications (e.g., aspirin, corticoster

Expected Response: the urination problems caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) cannot be prevented. some people believe that regular ejaculations will help prevent prostate enlargement. but there is no scientific proof that ejaculation helps. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

Baseline Response: There are two ways to think about this:
1. "I have no idea what it is and why it's happening".
2. "Why do I have to pee and how can I get out of this?".
It's a very simple question, but if you ask it the right way, you can get answers. Here is an example: "I

Expected Response: hi sounds like you have an upper uti should take about 5 days to get over if your doctor has given you no drugs try paracetamol or what ever you americans us instead also try this taking methenamine hippurate is an alternative to antibiotics. methenamine hippurate works by changing the chemical composition of your urine making it "less attractive" to bacteria. this info is from the uk's nhs. hope it helps you. good luck

Question: i have severe sinus headaches that are unaffected by ibuprofen zyrtecd and a nasal steroid. i take a nasal steroid spray nearly year round and i take zyrtec d to try and keep myself from all the awful symptoms. recently though the zyrtec hasn't been clearing the nasal inflamation when i have a headache. i will then take ibuprofen on top of that and it fails to work on the aching pain in my nose eye cavities cheeks and upper gums. in the last few days my nose has started to go cold on top of everything else. i'd appreciate any ideas.
Baseline Response: i am suffering from a severe sini headache that is usually very bad and sometimes worse than I would like. I have taken the zytec in the past week and am currently getting a lot of relief from it.

Expected Response: i recommend seeing your doctor. i have the same symptoms which for me is chronic sinus infection. see your doctor soon.
